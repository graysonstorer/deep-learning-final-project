Valve would 'love' Xbox Steamworks
==================================

Microsoft's closed platform holding studio back
-----------------------------------------------

By Andy Robinson for [CVG UK](https://web.archive.org/web/20130509025828/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/uk/)

Valve would "love to try" implementing Steam on Xbox 360, Erik Johnson told CVG.

The Portal developer shocked the world earlier this summer with the announcement that its Steamworks development suite [will be coming to PlayStation 3](https://web.archive.org/web/20130509025828/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/251909/gabe-newell-hearts-ps3-watch-again/), allowing for auto updates, community features, downloadable content and more.

Johnson said that the firm would "love" to do the same on Microsoft's console.

"Yeah. We think customers would like [Steam on Xbox 360]," he said at Gamescom last week. "We think, anyway. We'd love to try that."

It's been made clear in the past however, that Valve believes the decision is "not up to us". The studio would like Microsoft to relax its closed regulations on Xbox Live, which don't allow outsiders to put their own content onto the service (so mods, quick patches etc).

Another developer called on Microsoft to relax the rules last week; Final Fantasy XIV developer, Square Enix.

"That's mostly the problem," Producer, Sage Sundi [told us](https://web.archive.org/web/20130509025828/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/260762/final-fantasy-xiv-360-development-stopped/), when asked about the closed nature of Xbox Live.

"If 200,000 people maybe send an e-mail to Microsoft asking to give us access to the other side of Xbox Live then there's a possibility," he said.

People are more than happy with Microsoft's dictatorship I'm afraid - look how many subscribe to gold. Paying to play online - I know, madness, but people do it in their thousands.

Some people just love wearing the gimp suit.

I don't like it either, but it's either pay or I don't play with my friends.

There's a bit more to a gold xbl subscription than 'just to play online' mogs.

I would happily pay money on psn if the service was as good. Of course a lot of people are doing that now on the psn plus service.

You can now get certain game demo's from day 1 on ps3 woohoo.

If a substancial portion of the live community asked for it i'm sure MS would do it. It would be good business sense.

I wouldn't say I'm particularly happy about paying a subscription you ignorant plank yet it hardly breaks the bank either.

Steamworks and free updates would be great though.

You open it up to one developer though and you then have to do it for everyone. I'd personally prefer a closed, more robust network than an open one clogged up with extraneous bulls**t.

Don't think Microsoft would allow you to the backend of Live to be honest, they've worked pretty well so far, and allowing steam to put they're own content in, and soft patches etc would mean microsoft are allowing steam into the jewels.

And effectively, steam would grow even further into consoles, and abuse it. Just like they are with the PC.

No thanks, you can develop amazing games, just like every other developer has to.

Microsoft would do well to let Valve have some special privileges, since Valve have a huge fanbase, and the ones who dont own ps3's already will be keeping a sharp eye on this topic.

if i can see a future where all the games ive bought on steam will also be playable on a console (the ones released for it at least), im gonna want a piece of that.

as it is, just another reason why i'll end up getting a ps3.

> @JD_Method - There is another choice which you and your friends could just get a ps3 and play online for free.

I didn't realise all I had to do was just tell my friends to shell out �250 - �300 on a PS3 and buy all of our games again just so we can play them for free. ![Image 36: :roll:](https://web.archive.org/web/20130509025828im_/http://cdn.static.computerandvideogames.com/forums/images/smilies/icon_rolleyes.gif)

I already have a PS3, and so does one of my other friends on Xbox. I pay for Xbox Live to play with the rest.
