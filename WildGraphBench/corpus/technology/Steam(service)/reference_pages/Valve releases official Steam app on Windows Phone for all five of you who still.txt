You can’t seriously think I was going to miss an opportunity to have fun at Windows Phone’s expense.

Valve has released a version of of its Steam mobile app on the Windows Store for Windows Phones. The app, which has been available on Android and iOS for a good while, offers a multitude of handy features.

You can use it to browse the store and buy games, control your downloads remotely, view your profile, check your library and a lot more. There is, however, a more important use of the app: and that it allows you to use two-factor authentication when logging into your Steam account.

Recently, Valve [made this requirement for all market listings and trades](http://www.vg247.com/2016/03/02/steam-security-updates-coming-next-week-with-longer-trade-holds/), unless you want to wait 15 days for your listings to appear on the market.

You can download the Windows Phone version [through the store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/app/9nblggh4x7gm), but beware, it’s not as fully-featured as the iOS and Android ones. But, it at least covers the most basic needs.

_Sometimes we include links to online retail stores. If you click on one and make a purchase we may receive a small commission. For more information, go [here](http://www.vg247.com/affiliate-linking-policy/)._
