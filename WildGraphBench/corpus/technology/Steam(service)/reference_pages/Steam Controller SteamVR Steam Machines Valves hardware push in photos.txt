The "final" version of the Steam Controller.

Both of the battery covers' flaps can be depressed as an in-game button press. In our GDC demos of _Counter-Strike GO_ and _Unreal Tournament_, these were mapped to jump and crouch maneuvers.

Press the back bumper!

The deeper "trigger" button comes with a GameCube-like click when pressed fully, though it doesn't take as long to press down as the Nintendo pad's did.

5.   [![Image 6: Close up of a black Steam Deck directional pad and right thumb stick](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_4161-150x150.jpg)](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_4161-980x653.jpg)
Curiously, Valve didn't demo any games that made use of d-pad functionality. Based on our aimless tapping of it, we don't feel comfortable recommending it as anything close to a platformer-worthy pad.

6.   [![Image 7: Close up of the left side of a Steam controller including the Steam button, the direction-pad selector, the 'Y', 'X', 'B', and 'A' buttons, and the left haptic-feedback trackpad](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_4162-150x150.jpg)](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_4162-980x653.jpg)
The primary, mouse-like touchpad. Like in prior versions, it can be clicked down for an alternate button press, and it generates a trackpad-like sensation as your thumb glides along it.

7.   [![Image 8: Close up of a game controller and the top of a person's hand](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_4164-150x150.jpg)](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_4164-980x653.jpg)
Single joystick button depth.

The battery cover pops up when the bottom button is pushed. We found this out accidentally. Also, there's no rechargeable battery, nor does it work solely with a USB cord attached; this thing requires AA batteries.

SAN FRANCISCO—Enough [press releases](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/03/valve-announces-50-steam-link-streaming-box-free-source-2-engine/), enough GDC teases. On Wednesday, Valve Software finally unveiled a full range of Steam Machines, along with the "final"Steam Controller, the Steam Link streaming box, and even the SteamVR hardware. We'll soon talk at length about our half-hour demo with SteamVR, composed of six distinct, interactive demos, but for now, we'll recap our impressions of the rest of Valve's hardware spread.

Valve Software confirmed that we tested the "final" version of the Steam Controller, which received a November 2015 release window in an announcement yesterday. That final design includes two touchpads (with the left one having a d-pad shape etched onto it),a back panel that can be clicked down with middle fingers on both sides, a single joystick—[finally](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/03/steam-controller-prototype-version-2-impressions-buttoned-up/)—and an Xbox-style spread of face buttons and shoulder buttons. The above gallery has captions with some thoughts on the controller's features, including the new GameCube-like triggers.

SteamOS includes a few Steam Controller tweaking pages.

We demoed three games, all of which launched with WASD-and-mouse control schemes on PC: _The Talos Principle_, _Counter-Strike: Global Offensive_, and the new, in-development version of _Unreal Tournament_. In all three, Kyle and I still struggled to feel competent with the right-hand touchpad as a mouse replacement.We played against easiest-difficulty bots in the latter two games and could barely line up solid gunshots most of the time. It's one thing to say we'll "get used to it" after more time with the controller—the increased speed and "momentum roll" of swiping the touchpad seem like features that will really pay off for people who get used to the Steam Controller—but the bots we faced practically stood still most of the time, and we're not _that_ bad at first-person shooters.

[![Image 12: A person holding a Steam controller](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_4170-640x427.jpg)](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_4170.jpg)

[Enlarge](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_4170.jpg)/ Our biggest complaint was that the standard buttons were the slightest bit too small in their arrangement and size. We're not used to our thumb easily covering all four buttons at once.

Weirdly, we were more annoyed with the controller's final ABXY buttons. I thought they were too small—that's my thumb right there—while Kyle complained about their placement where you'd expect to find a joystick on both Sony and Microsoft's pads. The buttons'general action, at least, felt smooth and easy enough.

Steam Link, Steam Machines
--------------------------

[![Image 13: Steam Machine with a Steam logo in the corner, resting on a white surface](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_4183-980x653.jpg)](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_4183.jpg)

Steam Link. This $50 device is surprisingly heavy!

Steam Link. This $50 device is surprisingly heavy! 
2.   [![Image 15: A hand holding a black smartphone with a variety of ports on its side](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_4184-150x150.jpg)](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_4184-980x653.jpg)_Sam Machkovech_

Three USB ports in all. Valve confirmed that players can plug mice, keyboards, and wired controllers into these. 
3.   [![Image 16: Black rubber square pad in someone's hand](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_4182-150x150.jpg)](http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/IMG_4182-980x653.jpg)_Sam Machkovech_

The bottom. Oooh. 

Valve gave us a quick demo of the Steam Link to prove that the device could beam Steam content efficiently. We weren't convinced that it was a 100 percent perfect stream from PC to TV, since we noticed very, very small bits of artifacting in a rainy scene in _Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor_, but it was otherwise a stable, lag-free demo—albeit a brief one, and more importantly, run as a wired test as opposed to wireless. GDC is a bad place to test wireless tech, of course, but wireless streaming is an important feature we'll want to test before plunking down for one of these $50 boxes in November. If you're wondering, Valve didn't have anything to announce regarding dedicated streaming apps for Steam Link just yet.

_Sam Machkovech_

Get ready for 14 exciting computer form factors! I mean, Steam Machines!

In the case of Steam Machines, well, they're coming, and they're certainly more expensive than current-gen consoles. The 14 models that debuted at GDC start at no less than $460—the cheapest being an Athlon X4-powered rig by iBuyPower with a 1GB Radeon R7 video card inside—so Valve certainly isn't positioning any of its suppliers' machines to be affordable, mass-market living room devices.

SteamVR: Invading eyeballs since 2012
-------------------------------------

The rest of Valve's demo space was mostly made up of a long, museum-like display cataloguing SteamVR's ongoing development since 2012, along with a series of six demo rooms in which invited guests could test SteamVR's current build—in the form of the HTC Vive headset—for the first time. Kyle will post his impressions pretty soon, but in the meantime, enjoy a slightly out-of-context gallery about the VR system's genesis.

This is the current version of the SteamVR "Vive" headset co-created by HTC.

The current controllers. We'll have more on these soon, but take a look before diving into SteamVR's history gallery, which talks about their evolution.

We found this olllld Steam Controller prototype tucked into the gallery, as well, so we turned it around and snapped its photo, too.
