 As Valve celebrates the first birthday of Steam Greenlight's launch, company founder Gabe Newell keeps his eye on when such an approval process will cease to exist.

 Launched a year ago tomorrow, Greenlight was initially met with broad fanfare – this was a new feature of Valve's powerhouse Steam distribution platform that would allow its audience to have a say in what games were released on the 50 million-user-strong storefront. It purpose was to -- and remains -- to help break down walls between developers and players.

 But even the term "Greenlight" itself implies a gatekeeper – that someone, or some group, holds the authority to give you the go-ahead. That gatekeeper mentality goes directly against what Valve has in mind for Steam. For Valve, the endgame is to remove all bottlenecks, including Greenlight, and give game developers a platform to reach their audiences directly.

 "The immediate goal [of Greenlight] was to give us more data in the selection process as we ramp up the tools needed to get us to our longer term goal of improving the overall throughput of the system," Valve founder Gabe Newell tells us.

 "Before Greenlight, folks would send mail to us mail or fill out the posted submission form, hope that someone saw it and liked it, and waited in the dark for a reply. While it is not perfect, Greenlight helped us pull that process out of the dark and help with the selection process."
Unwanted bottleneck
===================

Valve has recognized for a while now that the Steam approval processes are a blockade. Newell has expressed that Steam's future is as a web API that any developer can call, and allowing anyone to create a Steam storefront page.

 Breaking down those walls is tricky, to say the least. Valve announced yesterday that it approved 100 titles via its Greenlight program, which is a big jump in volume, and the biggest batch of approvals yet.

 That signals progress in Greenlight's efficiency. But at its most efficient, the Greenlight approval process will completely disappear.

 "Ultimately, we hope to increase our throughput so significantly that the conversation about selection becomes antiquated," says Newell. "Then we can debate our ability or inability to properly aggregate and display the increased volume of titles being offered."
The Greenlight reality
======================

Greenlight's initial vision was totally in line with one of Valve's pillars of success: Putting the community first and giving players and game developers a voice.

 But when the service launched, and the flood of games poured in, reality hit: Developers weren't ready to game the popularity contest, the selection process has become confusing, good games were getting buried, and perhaps worst of all, it was still a considerable bottleneck between developers and the people who wanted to play their games.

 What was at first going to be something that would give the community full say in what came to Steam became a situation where Valve had to come in and play gatekeeper once again – Greenlighted games are decided by both the community and by Valve nowadays. That initial vision combined with the current reality tends to lead to confusion about what games are Greenlighted, and why.

 "Votes on Greenlight provide a useful point of data in gauging community interest, but we’re aware that votes alone may be an inexact form of gauging customer interest," Newell explains. "So we also try to incorporate additional information we have about factors such as press reviews, crowd-funding successes, performance on other similar platforms, and awards and contests to help form a more complete picture of community interest in each title."
The solution to the bottleneck
==============================

In other words, Valve still does have the final say, a fact that Newell, an always-self-aware businessman, can readily acknowledge. As Valve continues to chip away at its own self-imposed bottleneck, the company is coming to grips with the daunting challenge of game discoverability.

 "Much of the evolution of Steam and Greenlight is driven by what the community of gamers and developers tell us they want to see made possible," says Newell. "Right now, we’re focused on expanding the depth and breadth of our catalog. That expansion and addition of content is going to come with a need to innovate and iterate on how customers browse for games and evaluate potential purchases."

 "Evolving our tools to allow us to publish more titles more frequently is the solution for the bottleneck," he adds. "We’re working on it, and the 100 [Greenlighted games batch] was a big step towards the long term goal. This latest batch is both a celebration and a stress test of our systems. Future batches may not be as large but, if everything goes smoothly, we should be able to continue increasing the throughput of games from Greenlight to the store."

![Image 29: profile image](http://twimgs.com/gamasutra/images/questionmark.jpg)The discoverability thing is a bit of a mirage. 

 You can never overcome the fact that people only have so much time in the day to sift through piles of games. And the majority of games will never get seen by a majority of the people. 

 I think the basic knowledge is there already for finding games and you really can't do better than that. 

 I mean organization and discoverability are nothing new. Libraries have been doing it for ages. Digital doesn't change the principles behind it all. It just makes storage a non-issue. And computers let you search more quickly. We have always had magazines and services devoted to helping you find things. Now we have websites etc.

 And there will always be tradeoffs between a managed platform like iOS or a console and something wide open that people publish directly to.

I'm 90% a PC RPG player with some shooters and adventure games thrown in from time to time. If there was an RPG storefront on Steam curated by dedicated RPG fans, I would probably be MORE exposed to every RPG on the platform because I would check that storefront constantly.

Don't those already exist? Someone could start a website and link to Steam can't they? And maybe they can get a referral fee or should. Then we have Google. You can search for pc RPGs. Or 2013's best pc indie RPGs. And don't we have awards for best RPGs or best indie RPGs etc? I just feel like I don't have a problem finding games to play. If anything there are way too many games.

You can google "PC RPGs" but it would be great if that was integrated on Steam. But imagine if you enjoyed playing weird games like say Receiver or I Get This Call Everyday, how do you find that? You could google "weird games" but it would be better if you could just load up a Steam sub store of a guy who liked weird games and see what he found. Gabe himself talked about the concept of each person being able to create their own sub store and said he would be interested in a Yahtzee store. To me that does sound like the solution to the discoverability problem, just allow anyone to create a sub store (much like the current collections where every person can make a list of games) and let that person decide what goes on his storefront.

I have a difficult time believing anyone on this site has trouble finding games to play. And would you only want to look for games on Steam anyway? Some guys sell their games off their own sites don't they? I also have a hard time believing that if its on STeam store front then suddenly people will be motivated to keep an updated list of games they recommend. Always a problem with user created recommendations. And what's stopping anyone from just throwing whatever on their list? And will they just have a list or will it be reviews or ? Sounds like a website to me then. Don't we have those already? And does Steam really need "storefronts" so a user can look for rpgs? I mean can't you just search for rpgs on Steam and sort by a few categories as it is? Not sure how "store fronts" changes the picture except for integrating in on STeam. IF they make it easy to make storefronts you are just going to have 10,000+ store fronts. Really you'll probably end up with more stores than games. I guess then you can have ratings for the stores. But why not just have ratings for games then? Search for rpgs and go by rating or what not. OK maybe you want someone's recommendation. But if that person gains any sort of following they'd probably .....drum roll please.....start their own recommendation website. Last don't we have social networking available today to take advantage of as well? Why doesn't someone just start a favorite rpgs twitter feed.

I could also lurk through forums and whatever else. However it would certainly be easier if a few people put together a well done RPG storefront on a completely open Steam which showed all the relevant games in a highlighted way. Niche titles like Escalon could be treated like new releases and wikis and such show that motivated fans curate with the best of 'em. I would find it very useful. In contrast I find Steam's RPG filter pretty useless. Not every game is on it, tr genre sorting is often iffy at best and there is no promotion or hype factor. With specialized storefronts run by enthusiastic communities you are pretty much promised a spotlight as long as you target a market specifically. I think that's beneficial to consumers and developers.

This feels like it has great potential. I can definitely see some guy having his 'best Cthulhu games' page, that you could check and find all manner of happy Cthulhu stuff on. It doesn't matter that maybe there are only a dozen people in the world who care, the fact that those dozen people care a lot, and that this guy is obsessed on it, means that if you find that page you are going to get exactly what you want.

EA will make a substore for all of their stuff(Because Origin isn't enough :D ), IGN is going to make a substore with their stuff, Gabe Newell is going to make a substore with his favorite games. It will be cool letting everyone have their own store, but I think the reality is that just like there are hundreds of review sites people really only care about a handful of them. Minus the small niche sites. It will be like the affiliate program for amazon.

Are you saying there are no sites dedicated to rpgs? And if Valve doesn't even have a decent search for rpg games then how are you going to find the stores that tell you what games to play? You're likely to have more stores than games if you make easy to set one up. I just think too many are looking for a unicorn here. Make some rpg gaming acquaintances. The folks that start these indie rpg internet sites might have a twitter you can follow too. I think the assumption you make is that "storefronts" will be very diverse and numerous and very complete and thorough and reliable and yet very quick and easy to use. I think that's the unicorn.

![Image 49: profile image](http://twimgs.com/gamasutra/images/questionmark.jpg)I agree. Actualy this system only reward to good "social" developers, if the can reach a lot of people to vote for them (even if they aren't insterested on the game) they will succed. I saw many small studios with nice game never reach the greenlight because the aren't very social group.

 Steam has 4-5 millions of registered users, however only 75K-100K users go to vote usualy to greenlight. Maybe a good idea could be a mailing list to users with a selection by genre, new project added, etc... i don't mean daily, but maybe every friday, so the users will have the weekend to review the selection and vote.

 I think there is a lot of good ideas and options to make the Greenlight works better, i think Greenlight it is a good idea even it is a bottleneck, but can you imagine Steam without Greenlight and full of silly games like apps stores or full with pennis or dogs barking & vomiting games?

Who's going to buy a game if the developer can't find ways to let anyone know about it? Part of the job of being an indie developer is doing your own marketing. It's not Valve's job to market peoples' games for them.

Let me show you my point of view. Indie Developer not same as Indie Publisher, i mean, we develope but Steam is publising the game, so, if they publish they must promote for sales (when game it is greenlighted). It is the same with books, music, films... developers/writers/musicians/etc... they are not publisher, they make what they know well, their job and publisher make their job because they get a part from revenue, right? So, if I develope, I publish and I make the marketing, what it is then the Steam work? The classical 'mafia' with the rule of "if you cross my street you must to pay us"??? I do not think so, Steam make a good job, they promote the games, i saw it with all the games. However, it is good for developer make a good PR too, but this not mean be "social". The social side will arrive alone if they make a good job and gamers like their games. However, Greenlight expect a new developer be social from the begining and this is not easy because they must use their effors on develope not posting of forums and blogs about their game and later defending theirself on forums about "scam" prosecution because they are so newbie. Every task has his job. Developers and Publishers. Many developers are publishers too but not all. This is only my humble point of view. :) [Login to Reply or Like](http://www.gamasutra.com/sso/login.php?from=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/199249/For_Gabe_Newell_Greenlight_is_just_a_stepping_stone_to_a_bigger_endgame.php) Reply | [Like](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/199249/For_Gabe_Newell_Greenlight_is_just_a_stepping_stone_to_a_bigger_endgame.php) [Submit Reply](javascript:void(0)) | [Cancel Reply](javascript:void(0))

![Image 60: profile image](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/edit/img/portrait/921951/thumb_portrait.jpg?1350781367)I do hope we can get to user generated store fronts "inside" Steam. It'd be nice to keep it all inside the same framework and style instead of wandering around the nets. Of course the problem then becomes how do you find the User storefronts and how do those who manage the storefronts find the games? Are there rewards for doing all that work? 

 Every solution breeds more questions.

There are way more users than games. A small percentage or fraction of a percent would be all it takes to make this come true. Then how do find which store fronts are the best? Ratings? If so why not just rate the games then? And search by category? And who says the vast majority of Steam users will even check out user storefronts? I would guess the vast majority of Steam users have more games than time as it is. To me the only thing this does is make it all STeam exclusive for better and worse.

![Image 64: profile image](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/edit/img/portrait/316033/thumb_portrait.jpg?1377861647)Funny coincidence, just today not even knowing we are celebrating 1 year of Greenlight, we announced we are pulling our game Altitude0 off of GL. 

 I was checking statistics and feeling quite down after noticing the visitor curve on our project page during the last year. 52% of visitors came in the first day, afterwards the curve looks as flat as they get. Many times visitors stumbling on our page act like they discovered some hidden goodies.

 Yes I heard suggestions today on GL forums on how I didn't try hard enough to build community and expose myself. But guess what, I was developing the game, posting updates, screenshots, videos and replaying to comments was all I could do. I cannot spend many hours every day hanging with the Steam community promoting my work.

 My game is an airplane racing game, game is not hitting the main cool wave but our players are dedicated and loyal players. Not riding the cool wave will not get your game upvoted by enough people unless you privately annoy everybody you know or sell your soul to the devil. Still I do believe there is large enough user base, just not in the voting camp.

 But it does hurt a bit to see games passing through the process that are obviously lacking a lot.

 I guess passionate up voters will let us know what is good and cool.

I'm too busy developing the game, aside from the occasional update I don't have loads of time nor money to spend promoting the game to get enough votes for it to be Greenlit. My game is in the racing game category too, which definately seems a minor genre to the masses... hard to compete in a democracy vote against RPGS and Zombie games, which are the current trend. The big problem is discovery by the Steam user base. 20000 views in the year it's been on Greenlight. Out of a 50 million userbase, that sounds like a problem right there.

![Image 70: profile image](http://twimgs.com/gamasutra/images/questionmark.jpg)It sounds like steam is trying to transition from one business model into another. It needs to decide whether it wants to be a curated store or a more open game purchasing api that anyone can use. If they try both they won't succeed at either. 

 The problem they have is that currently the main benefit for being on steam is the free promotion they give to these publishers. At the moment I imagine that steam makes most of its money from larger publishers like Sega and others. They give free drm, multiplayer and promotion services to sega and in exchange any user that buys a physical copy of the game will end up with steam on their computer.

 It's a smart plan from steam because when physical retail of games goes away they will hope to be the digital distributor that everyone uses. The problem is as soon as physical retail goes away steam will stop being only a benefit to these publishers and start only being a competitor. I bet every major publisher will try and move consumers over to their own system.

 Long term I think the only way steam can hope to succeed is being a more open game distribution service. No large publisher would be happy with letting another publisher like valve have total control over what they distribute and promote. At the moment to get stocked in retail shops they have to agree to sell digital copies at a higher price than physical ones otherwise shops won't stock them. Once retail goes away and the publishers have total control over their digital prices they will try and move all their customers over to their own store so they don't need to give a cut to valve. I don't think most people care about what platform they use they will just get the game where it is cheapest.

![Image 71: profile image](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/edit/img/portrait/5850/thumb_portrait.jpg?1366913838)As time goes on this will become more refined. So keep at it Valve. If someone can offer better, offer it. Otherwise reserve excessive criticism for those who aren't doing anything. I think those who take the risks next generation stand to gain the most. The ones who weather the storm will lose the most.

![Image 72: profile image](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/edit/img/portrait/5876/thumb_portrait.jpg?1350007610)If low user participation in Greenlight is an issue, there are lots of things Valve could do to incentivize them. If an user records 10 votes, give them a chance at those trading cards used in the Steam Sales.

 Also, wonder why people rarely complain about discovery on Amazon or music recommendation services? Steam should put personalized recommendations on the very front page of Steam. Seems more fair and could give a long tail to plenty of developers.

That's the issue with offering other incentives to increase voting. The majority of Steam users don't care about Greenlight. It is the XBLIG of Steam. You cannot make them care about aiding the proper function of Greenlight, and attempts to do so will pervert the system. There is already a similar issue with Greenlight participants, who sometimes flat out give away their games to buy votes in the Greenlight popularity contest. I would guess that a good percentage of "Yes, I would buy this game" votes in general come from people who already have a game through a Bundle deal or giveaway, and just want it Greenlit so that they can get a free Steam key. (Another good percentage of "Yes" votes simply come from people who might like to see a game get on Steam, but don't actually have any intention to buy it. Or just want it on Steam so that it will eventually be 75% off in a sale.)

![Image 76: profile image](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/edit/img/portrait/6626/thumb_portrait.jpg?1329669658)Steam Greenlight, been there done that.

 Some of the obvious problems are this ~ it doesn't get face time in the browser (being at the bottoom of the page), I would think many people simply have no clue it is even a part of Steam that go there for the game they want to play.

 It doesn't have a good way to sort through new developments, needs organizational titles..

 Last, with the glut of games, even a decent game will be overlooked. too much info and again not enough explanation of what sort of gameplay experiences are possible.

 the rating system is pretty meh, need basic ratings and comments that are sortable instead of 1 long rambling or none at all. Even something as basic as "polish", "innovation", "complexity", "art style"..needs basic direction arrows for hey "what's" this .. as the developer considers and the consumer relates comments.

 The feed back system is just killing it.

 Having a rating system ~ isn't the problem, Gabe.

 The other thing, is I've found thing there I've been looking for, but it's such a smattering it's too difficult to judge if something is wrth my time compared to something more modern ... and some games are simply not there but should be. It's less of an issue of "most players pick x" and more of an issue of "most games are x" . The variety issue stems from what you main stream advertise.

![Image 77: profile image](http://twimgs.com/gamasutra/images/questionmark.jpg)The other issue with Green Light and I HATE to say it but TOO MANY garbage and crap titles clog the system and it becomes hard for the true gems to be found.

 Of course every developer thinks that their game is a true gem but the reality is that many titles don't even deserve to be on Steam Green Light let alone steam.

![Image 80: profile image](http://twimgs.com/gamasutra/images/questionmark.jpg)One of the biggest problems i find as a voter on green light is developers often treat it more like a chance to jump into a kickstarter of sorts. They often don't have a finished game or a playable demo but they want to be on steam. I asume to assist in gaining exposure and finance the financing of the game. That is not what steam or even GL is for.

 I'd advise if you want to sell early exposure versions of a game there is Desura.com, indievania, exc exc to do it. Get the game finished and then later when the game is done, go to get on steam. If the game is a 7.5 out of 10 but finished then it will make it on to steam sooner or later. If the game is a .3.7 version, it likely doesn't belong on steam.

 I was a late starter for GL. I didn't start voting until about 6 months ago. The reason was i was in no hurry to wade through a ton of "game ideals with 1-2 levels done" just for a promo video and screen shots. 

 Every game i have up voted (will buy) had a demo to allow me to get a feeling of what the game plays like.

 Theres no question there are just too many titles on GL but alot of those are not games, the game is the finished product. 

 Developers having a Demo and a url to it, has sold me several games that aren't on steam yet. 

 Thats just my take as a GL voter.

![Image 81: profile image](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/edit/img/portrait/942624/thumb_portrait.png?1376920658)It's exciting to see more games going through Greenlight. I think it acts as a decent filter for people who aren't even close to ready to show their projects in public.

 On another note, anyone have a direct Steam contact number for billing? Customer service on e-mail hasn't responded :)

![Image 83: profile image](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/edit/img/portrait/934282/thumb_portrait.jpg?1364248453)As one of the early graduates from Steam Greenlight with "Folk Tale" ( currently on Steam Early Access ), I wanted to thank Gabe and everyone at Steam for giving indie developers such an unbelievable opportunity.

 I understand the issues that surround GL, but I urge other indie developers to embrace the process and support Steam while they work through those issues. Promote the hell out of your game, because the number of opportunities that open up to you post-graduation is phenomenal.

![Image 86: profile image](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/edit/img/portrait/979/thumb_portrait.jpg?1244741259)Greenlight reminds me of the early days of the Steam client itself. They had to start with "something"? 

 I embrace the "end-game" == the "Steam Store" as an API.

 Until then, I will curse each time, I am browsing through the Greenlight pages. I want to search through those titles with custom search filters. The database needs to have at least 30-50 searchable cells (rpg, fps, demo-available, kickstarter-funded, game-developer names(!), gamepad-support, opengl, mac, linux, price-range, mod-enabled, character-customization, 3d-stereoscopic support, 5.1 audio, etc, etc, etc ...) ... just like the Workshop needs more (meaningful) search filter options.

 Playing the "social" meta-game of "likes" to please the most caffeinated mob, does neither help the game you really want to make, nor the game you end up selling? You can spend your cycles more productively?

![Image 87: profile image](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/edit/img/portrait/300/thumb_portrait.jpg?1239775245)Fishing Cactus has been an early adopter of GL. We have one game that is still running inside the system but very far away from the top 100 (45% far away to be precise). When I take a look at the concept pages or the games that have been greenlighted (or in the TOP 100) they almost look like all the same, same genre, same trends. Actually it is normal when you ask for anyone what they like most on Internet you end up with cats and babes. I guess same applies for games that are curated only by gamers: you get zombies, shooters and RPGs. Some of them are crappy games made by illusionary teams that are never going to deliver.

 The only exceptions are indie developers with a lot of coverage (on a short period of time) who can make it through the cracks of a junkyard dump of games that are all looking the same and the horde of haters. At the moment they (such indies) can leverage a significant user base in a short amount of time and take advantage of the frontpage traffic (where other projects build over time but usually once they are out of the frontpage they are dead). This is how great little products have made their way through the system, not thanks to the "mass" gamers voting once in a while for the next blood fest game.

 So yes I feel the system is currently flawed and once you are in a dead end, you cannot really go upward again unless you have great press coverage (and I'm not even sure this is enough when this is not associated with front page traffic) or a lot of marketing to spend. For the latter, spending a lot of dollars in marketing to get greenlighted just doesn't feel right. For a small to middle game made by indies, it is just a no go.

 Solutions? There are plenty: a way to highlight good games (rate it)? Staff picks to make smaller games or genres standout? Make the "favorites" tag more important than the upvote? Allow projects that have more updates to have a specific spotlight? Filter the games on genres? Pre-screen projects before making them available to the crowd (so people are not feeling they are reviewing garbage most of the time)?

![Image 88: profile image](http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/edit/img/portrait/4925/thumb_portrait.jpg?1318443662)I still think this is a bad idea. Developers aren't crying to get onto Steam for the API stuff. That is just an added benefit if anything. What developers want is the very exclusivity that Steam offers. If you dilute the power of that exclusivity the customers themselves wont value the content provided as exclusivity goes away. Sure the idea of allowing the customer base to have custom store fronts is a good idea, and is an aspect that I like, but it really ends what Steam is when they dissolve the approval process.. To a customer getting that Steam logo on a game means that the developer went through the ridiculous approval process and Steam ultimately said Yes! Being as they said yes I as a customer think that it isn't one of the million other indie games, that are probably crap. This whole thing removes the reason why people want to develop for Steam and why the customers trust it. I just hope this is more Gabe pipedream rhetoric.

Curation is low on the list of reasons CUSTOMERS enjoy Steam. Developer bias will result in these types of arguments where it's about the customer but really it's about the experienced developers wanting an insulated marketplace away from all the riffraff. Storefronts will provide your equivalents of Sax Fifth Avenues and your WalMarts, Thrift and Dollar stores. But otherwise allowing all apps to find a suitable store to take advantage of Steam distribution system is a very good thing.
