# A Brand New Steam

A Brand New Steam — Available Now!
----------------------------------

The new Steam UI is here, which enhances the way you already buy and play games, adding more info about the things that matter — getting games, playing them with friends, and staying current in the gaming world.

If you haven't already updated, you can use the "Check for Steam client updates" option on the "File" menu to automatically update Steam to the new release. If you don't have Steam installed, [download it today](http://storefront.steampowered.com/download/SteamInstall.msi/).

Read on to see the changes we've made.

Friends First
-------------

Since its introduction in 2003, Steam has been centered around social gaming. But Steam users have rightly come to expect more than a simple social network alongside their games. The new Steam puts far more friend-related info at your fingertips. Right from within your own game Library, you can now track which of your friends plays each game or invite them to play one with you. Before you've even bought a game, knowing whether your friends play it is one of the most useful pieces of information to have. So on the store homepage, there's a new listing of what your friends have bought or played lately. On each game's store page, see who among your friends plays it, and whether it's on anyone's wishlist.

All the News that's Fit to Feed
-------------------------------

Thanks to auto-updating, Steam has for a long time made it easy to keep up to date with the latest versions of your games. But it has sometimes remained tricky to stay up on the latest gaming news. The new Steam lets you know what has happened lately, either about your favorite games or in the broader world of computer gaming. A new central aggregated news page lists all available channels for easy reading, viewable as headlines only or full stories. Each game has a new dedicated news channel of its own, right inside your game library. Interested in the latest news about Modern Warfare 2? Look no further than your own game list. Game-specific news is even now accessible inside each game, via the new and improved Steam overlay. And all of this news isn't just the stuff written back at Steam headquarters — we're passing through articles written directly by authors of syndicated feeds from top computer gaming sources.

Achieving Bliss
---------------

Whether you think of achievements as merit badges, or candy, or crack, the thing most of us can agree on is that we all want more of 'em. Keeping track of which ones you've got and which ones to get next shouldn't feel like a chore. With this in mind, the new Steam brings the achievements to you — listing recent accomplishments right in your game Library, and on the in-game overlay.

Library Wrangling
-----------------

As Steam has grown, your collection of Steam games has probably grown too. In order to help you manage that huge library, we've added a more robust game list. You can now organize your list of titles into custom categories, like "Games I should play with Emily" or "Old School" or "Super-Addictive MMOs". Also, browse your own collection visually using the all-new grid view. Last but also least (from the better-late-than-never feature department) you can even type a game's name in the list to find it immediately.

Odds, Ends and Extras
---------------------

What else, you say? There's a new Downloads view, to help you track current (and recent) acquisitions and updates. Fonts look better, across the platform. The games List View now includes thumbnail images. It's easier to find things on sale, in the store. You can accept or decline invites right from within your friends list. Send a hint by broadcasting your Steam wishlist to your friends via your community blotter. Better exposure of Steam Cloud status, per game. A new embedded web browser. And lots of bug fixes.
