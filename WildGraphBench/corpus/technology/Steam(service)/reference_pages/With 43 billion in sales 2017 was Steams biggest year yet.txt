Steam is the biggest digital game distributor on PC, and 2017 was the best year yet for Valve's platform. We already knew [7,600 games were released on Steam](https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam-games-released-2017) last year, but now we know roughly how much money it generated: approximately $4.3 billion.

_Want to not spend money at Valve's store? These are the [best free Steam games](https://www.pcgamesn.com/nine-best-free-play-games-steam)._

That's according to Steam Spy proprietor (and Epic's head of publishing in Eastern Europe) Sergey Galyonkin, who's hosting a panel on Steam's numbers at GDC today. The $4.3 billion number is an estimate, but it's likely the most accurate one we're going to get, and it doesn't include revenue generated by DLC or microtransactions.

> 2017 was the best year for Valve so far: Steam's share of the market grew to $4.3B, not counting in-apps and DLCs.

It's an impressive stat, and even more so when you consider the fact that entire [PC game business earned a total of $32.3 billion last year](https://www.pcgamesn.com/pc-game-sales-numbers-market-share-2017). If you throw out revenue for packaged retail titles and browser games, that leaves the dedicated digital PC game business with a total value of $23.9 billion - and that number includes DLC, which the Steam estimate does not.

If the numbers are right, that means Valve own at least 18% of their specific market, and likely far more than that once in-game purchases are accounted for.
