EA has commented on the removal of Dragon Age 2 from the Steam PC client, apparently blaming Valve's policies on downloadable content.

"At EA, we offer our games and content to all major download services including GameStop, Amazon, Direct2Drive and Steam," EA's SVP of global e-commerce David DeMartini told IGN.

"Unfortunately, Steam has adopted a set of restrictive terms of service which limit how developers interact with customers to sell downloadable content. No other download service has adopted this practice. Consequently some of our games have been removed by Steam."

Crysis 2 was also removed from Steam last month over similar issues, and just a few weeks ago [EA](http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-07-11-ea-omits-steam-from-list-of-battlefield-3-retailers) left Steam off a list of digital retailers that would support Battlefield 3.

"We hope to work out an agreement to keep our games on Steam," said DeMartini.
