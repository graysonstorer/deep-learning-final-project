*Steam requires a Broadband connection. Term “broadband” refers to any Internet connection capable of sustained throughput of at least 256Kbps. We have designed it to deliver the optimum experience at 384Kbps. The technology will work at lower speeds but the experience will be slower and may require longer waiting periods before content is available. The only forms of phone line transmission omitted by this restriction is ISDN (128Kbps) and traditional dial-up modems (<56Kbps).
