![Image 5: Garry's Mod](http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2012/03/Garrys-Mod-610x240.jpg)

Garry Newman, creator of the brilliant sandbox Source mod, Garry’s Mod, has posted a graph of the game’s entire Steam sales history on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/garrynewman/status/180684499926007809). The graph features a red line that represents Garry’s predicted sales, and a white line that depicts the actual sales. There is quite a big difference. Garry predicted that interest would tail off towards the end of 2009, but it just kept on going, and going. It’s selling more than twice the number of copies each week than it was when it was first released back in 2007. Take a look.

[![Image 6: Garrys Mod sales graph](http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2012/03/Garrys-Mod-sales-graph-590x171.png)](http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2012/03/Garrys-Mod-sales-graph.png)

Look at those spikes. The mini jaggies are all weekends, the massive spikes will be Steam sales and promotions. Garry confirmed to a [Twitter inquirer](https://twitter.com/#!/garrynewman/status/180686235973586944) that the graph shows the sale of 1.4 million copies. The steady growth of Garry’s Mod will be down to more than just word of mouth. Garry’s Mod receives constant updates, all of which are listed over on the official [Garry’s Mod site](http://garrysmod.com/). In short, Garry is probably doing quite well from his creation. The success of Garry’s mod shows that supporting a game for a long time after release can pay off quite spectacularly.

Garry’s Mod is available now on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/). The outdated [Garry’s Mod version 9](http://store.steampowered.com/app/90024/) is free. It doesn’t have all the features of number 10, but serves well as a demo if you want to check it out.

![Image 21: Garry's Mod](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/pcgamer/media/img/missing-image.svg)

Garry Newman, creator of the brilliant sandbox Source mod, Garry's Mod, has posted a graph of the game's entire Steam sales history on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/garrynewman/status/180684499926007809) . The graph features a red line that represents Garry's predicted sales, and a white line that depicts the actual sales. There is quite a big difference. Garry predicted that interest would tail off towards the end of 2009, but it just kept on going, and going. It's selling more than twice the number of copies each week than it was when it was first released back in 2007. Take a look.

Look at those spikes. The mini jaggies are all weekends, the massive spikes will be Steam sales and promotions. Garry confirmed to a [Twitter inquirer](https://twitter.com/#!/garrynewman/status/180686235973586944) that the graph shows the sale of 1.4 million copies. The steady growth of Garry's Mod will be down to more than just word of mouth. Garry's Mod receives constant updates, all of which are listed over on the official [Garry's Mod site](http://garrysmod.com/) . In short, Garry is probably doing quite well from his creation. The success of Garry's mod shows that supporting a game for a long time after release can pay off quite spectacularly.

Garry's Mod is available now on [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/) . The outdated [Garry's Mod version 9](http://store.steampowered.com/app/90024/) is free. It doesn't have all the features of number 10, but serves well as a demo if you want to check it out.
