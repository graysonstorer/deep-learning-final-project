[Steam](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/platforms/pc/steam/ "Platforms > Steam") has broken its all-time record for active players, as countries around the world isolate amid the COVID-19 outbreak.

On Sunday the platform recorded [7.25 million users concurrently playing games](https://steamdb.info/graph/), which narrowly beat the record set in January 2018 (7.2m).

Steam also broke its record for concurrent active users (people using the service but not necessarily in-game) for [the third weekend in a row](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/steam-broke-its-concurrent-user-record-for-a-second-weekend/).

On Sunday the [PC](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/platforms/pc/ "Platforms > PC") games platform registered some 23.4 million active users, beating the previous records of 22m set last weekend.

Gaming platforms have seen a surge in activity in recent weeks, as governments across the world advise citizens to stay at home and avoid socialising.

This month [both Nintendo and Xbox online services experienced downtime](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-switch-online-services-are-down-worldwide/), with [Microsoft](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/companies/microsoft/ "Companies > Xbox Game Studios (Microsoft)") confirming its own outage was due to increased demand.

[Sony](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/companies/sony/ "Companies > Sony Interactive Entertainment") has moved to [slow PlayStation download speeds](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-confirms-its-now-slowed-download-speeds-in-the-us/) in the US and Europe, while [Microsoft has said it’s attempting to push “higher-bandwidth activities” like game updates during off-peak hours](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/update-2-on-microsoft-cloud-services-continuity/).

[In the UK physical game sales have recently tripled](https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/animal-crossing-switch-had-a-record-physical-launch-in-the-uk/), with retailers reportedly crediting the increase in demand for games to consumers preparing to stay at home to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus.

Overall more than 475,000 physical games were sold in the UK in the week ending March 22, which is more than three times the previous week’s numbers.
