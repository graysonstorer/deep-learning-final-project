Valve is rolling out a handful of new experimental features for Steam, but those additions won’t be headed right to the storefront’s homepage.

Instead, the company has launched a home for toying with new and potentially interesting features called [Steam Labs](https://store.steampowered.com/labs), and opened up access to the first three additions to the general public.

The tools and tests found within range in size and scope, but each is a potential peek at solutions Valve has pitched and mulled over internally to address some of the shortcomings of its massively popular game platform.

[The Interactive Recommender](https://store.steampowered.com/recommender/76561198013085986) is among these, and has been [gathering no small amount of buzz](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/346495/Devs_express_optimism_caution_over_Steam_interactive_recommender.php) from developers curious about the neural net-powered game recommendation tool. More about that specific experiment can be found [here](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/346485/Steam_embraces_machine_learning_with_new_interactive_recommendation_tool.php), but,in short, the tool uses play data, machine learning, and other interactive criteria to create compelling and personalized game recommendations for Steam users.

Aside from that, Valve has also launched two video-focused creations in Steam Labs that each highlight new games on the platform in their own ways.

[Micro Trailers](https://store.steampowered.com/labs/microtrailers) generates short, six-second long trailers for games on Steam, an experimental feature Valve says attempts to give Steam users a way to quickly get their eyes on titles they might be interested in. Valve has generated a handful of these already, broken down in slightly different presentation styles over ono its Steam Labs page.

The other video-focused creation, [The Automated Show](https://store.steampowered.com/labs/automaticshow), aims to act as a sort of daily digest for new Steam releases. That experiment features a half hour long show (generated by a bot) that quickly runs through new additions for the day across categories like ‘new and popular’ and individual genres.

“Right now, the automated show bot is a black obelisk that sits in Boston, Massachusetts, and will only generate an episode when someone speaks a complex series of prime numbers into its electronic ears,” explains Valve. “It's mostly-automated, but requires a human to kick it off. Should we continue with this experiment, we'll want to make it something that runs daily or weekly without human intervention.”
