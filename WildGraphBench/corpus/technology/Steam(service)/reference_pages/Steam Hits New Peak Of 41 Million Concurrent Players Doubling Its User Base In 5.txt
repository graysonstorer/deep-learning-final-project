Story Highlight

*   Steam hit a new concurrent player peak of 41.6 million players yesterday.
*   The platform has gained almost 10 million new players in just under two years.
*   In addition, Steam has doubled the peak concurrent player count it had before COVID.

The gaming industry is one of constant ups and downs, with even the biggest companies ending up in trouble rather frequently. However, one brand that keeps breaking its own records is Steam, Valve’s digital storefront for the purchase of video games.

A massive reason Steam has become the consistent profit machine it is now rests on Valve’s preference for[pandering to the customers](https://tech4gamers.com/valve-steam-constantly-growing-customers-forefront/). And, thanks to such consumer-friendly policies, the storefront is continuing to rake in millions of new players.

**Why This Matters**: Steam is bulletproof evidence that you can succeed in the gaming industry by putting the customer first.

![Image 9: Steam concurrent player peak](blob:http://localhost/d913cb51d5ea4ebb78b00e2e2d965353)

The chart showcases how Steam has doubled its player base this decade.

Steam has hit a [new concurrent player count](https://steamdb.info/app/753/charts/#9y) of **41 million online users**, beating the previous record it set a few days ago by a million new players. To be exact, **41,666,455 players** were online at the same time yesterday, probably thanks to new and popular[online titles like Battlefield 6](https://tech4gamers.com/battlefield-6-concurrent-players-steam/).

To showcase how exponentially Steam is growing, the platform hit a peak of**33 million players** back in January 2024, meaning it has gained almost 10 million new consumers in under two years.

Furthermore, Steam has doubled its concurrent user peak in half a decade, as per the charts available on SteamDB. Back in **2020**, the platform had hit a peak of **19 million players** on the day COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, and since then, it has more than doubled its player base, as the numbers show.

**COVID-19** did play a role in the wider adoption of Steam and the gaming industry as a whole, but that shouldn’t take away any credit from Valve. The company has prevented any publishers from [making ad revenue](https://tech4gamers.com/valve-bans-in-game-ads/) on the storefront, pandering to the consumers.

![Image 11: Steam Deck 2 Featured](blob:http://localhost/90ddc4d127f66059c9f933ae7f9a6294)

Steam has also been expanding into the console market.

Valve employees also bring in [more money than Apple and Netflix workers](https://tech4gamers.com/valve-employees-money-microsoft-apple/) combined, adding another layer to why Steam is the[multibillion-dollar giant](https://tech4gamers.com/how-valve-created-a-multi-billionare-dollar-market/) it is today.
