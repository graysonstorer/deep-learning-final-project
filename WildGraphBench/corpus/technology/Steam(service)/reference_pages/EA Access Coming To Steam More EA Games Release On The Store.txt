EA's subscription service, EA Access, is officially making its way to Steam. The news coincides with the release of a handful of new EA-published games on the service, although some of its heaviest hitters--[Apex Legends](https://www.gamespot.com/apex-legends/), [FIFA 20](https://www.gamespot.com/fifa-20/), [Battlefield V](https://www.gamespot.com/battlefield-v/), and so on--remain Origin-only on PC.

Notably, the service on Steam will be called EA Access, mimicking the naming convention used for the Xbox One and PS4 versions. PC already has its own version of EA Access, dubbed Origin Access, that operates through the EA-run Origin store.

_Now Playing:_ Opening 17 Minutes of Unravel 2 Co-op Gameplay

Origin Access has expanded since its initial launch to offer two versions: Basic and Premier. Basic functions much like EA Access on consoles, offering 10-hour trials to upcoming games, unlimited access to a selection of games in the Vault, and discounts on Origin purchases. Premier, meanwhile, adds in full access to brand-new games.

Word of EA Access's launch on Steam comes by way of an image on the [store page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1233570/Mirrors_Edge_Catalyst/) for the newly launched EA games on the store. As you can see below, it suggests that EA Access on Steam will work like Origin Access Basic; the Premier version would presumably require that all EA games launch immediately on Steam. The publisher has avoided doing that with many of its releases since the debut of Origin, although there have been exceptions--last year's [Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order](https://www.gamespot.com/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order/) did land on Steam.

EA Access on Steam

As noted above, EA has released a number of new games (along with their DLC) on Steam today. These include:

*   Burnout Paradise Remastered
*   Crysis 3
*   Dragon Age Inquisition
*   Fe
*   Mirror's Edge Catalyst
*   need for Speed
*   Need for Speed Heat
*   Need for Speed Rivals
*   Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville
*   Sea of Solitude
*   Unravel
*   Unravel 2

Most of these are on sale at a discount of 50% or more from now until July 9.

A release date for EA Access on Steam has not yet been announced. EA may be planning to share more during its upcoming [EA Play showcase](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/e3-2020-replacement-event-schedule-ps5-ubisoft-and/1100-6473601/), which is currently set to take place on June 11.
