Today, Valve changed the mod-making game bigtime: [creators can now charge for modifications](http://steamed.kotaku.com/modders-can-now-make-money-on-steam-1699760897) to pre-existing games on Steam Workshop. Some people are hopeful, others are worried—and even infuriated.

Generally speaking, PC game mods are free. Steam, however, just added an option to let creators…[Read more Read more](http://steamed.kotaku.com/modders-can-now-make-money-on-steam-1699760897)

Obviously, paying for mods—even just as an option—is a pretty big change from what people are used to. It’s not uncommon for people to ask for donations, a nickel or two going clink in the cup, but charging upfront? Definitely not the standard. Some, however, are worried that it could become the norm, not the exception, which would fundamentally alter the mod scene. Mods, they fear (and have, to a small extent, observed), will stop updating for those who don’t pay, will abandon mod-centric services like Nexus for Steam’s greener pastures.

And the comment threads on some Steam Workshop _Skyrim_ mods have gotten [downright ugly](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/comments/428651577).

Meanwhile, Nexus owner and admin Dark0ne, in [a prescient post](http://www.nexusmods.com/games/news/12444/) last month, speculated about what would happen if people started charging for mods, adding that he doesn’t plan to change a thing about the way Nexus operates. He worries that tossing money into the pot might hurt both modmakers and those who play them:

> “How many mods on the Nexus use assets made by other mod authors? How many are made better by this? Such assets are used with the express permission of the creators of those assets. If a mod author came to you and asked if he could use some of your work in their mod that they were planning to sell for $5, would you feel more or less inclined to give him that permission? Would you, perhaps rightly, ask for a cut of the proceeds, a revenue share of your own? If you’re one of those great authors who releases your mods freely for others to make use of in their mods, or a modder’s resource developer, are you going to think about revisiting all your permissions in light of money entering the modding community? Are you still thinking about being so generous with your work?”
> 
> 
> “The worry is with the introduction of Curated Workshops that free and open modding will be removed entirely, as in, it just won’t be possible to do... If you ask me, my main concern now is the DRMification and closing down of free and open modding, the concept that modding can only take place if it’s done through one official platform to the detriment of all others. Because up until now that’s definitely not what modding has been about at all.”

Meanwhile, others are concerned about how little mod creators are actually making off this deal: 25 percent of revenues in _Skyrim_’s case. They think game publishers might end up taking nearly the entire pie, leaving creators with only rib-sticking slivers. In their eyes, it’s a lose-lose situation for everyone—mod creators and players alike—except publishers.

![Image 38: Steam Users See Big Problems With Charging For Mods](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--Z84rRN4w--/1222004331820177986.png)[1](http://steamed.kotaku.com/this-is-really-dumb-if-you-are-going-to-let-people-sell-1699891511)

This is really dumb if you are going to let people sell mods give them a bigger cut. Considering a lot of mods use original meshes, textures, sounds and animations, it is pretty dumb to only give them 25%.

P.S. I think this whole plan will seriously hurt the modding community

_(**Note**: Valve has confirmed to me that publishers/developers get to decide the amount of revenue they take from mods if they choose to let players sell them. Valve, meanwhile, takes “the same share of sales as any other microtransaction sale.”)_

Unsurprisingly (given that this is, after all, The Internet), there’s already [a petition](https://www.change.org/p/valve-remove-the-paid-content-of-the-steam-workshop?recruiter=77218624&utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=share_twitter_responsive) to have the paid portion of Steam Workshop hurled back into the deepest recesses of Valve’s mad mod laboratory. As of writing it had over three thousand signatures.

But others see potential in Steam Workshop’s megaton bomb of a new feature, even as it leaks radiation everywhere, shows its cracks and flaws. Modders and game developers, especially, seem to be leaning more toward the optimistic side of the spectrum. Creators like Jimo have embraced the system fully, going so far as to [collaborate with Valve](http://jimo.co.uk/post/116990857404) to help launch the paid-for portion of the Steam Workshop.

Meanwhile, developers like _[Offworld Trading Company](http://store.steampowered.com/app/271240/)_ creator (and former _Civilization_ designer) Soren Johnson being so bold as to say:

![Image 42: Steam Users See Big Problems With Charging For Mods](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--Rs7AiUG2--/1222004332093278530.png)

_[Emerald Kindgom](http://www.doublecluepon.com/)_’s production director verbalized what many people on the pro-charging-for-mods side of things are feeling: modders are developers too, and they should be afforded similar options and opportunities.

![Image 43: Steam Users See Big Problems With Charging For Mods](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--gR6cCnq1--/1222004332166519106.png)

Campo Santo (_[Firewatch](http://www.firewatchgame.com/)_) creative director Jake Rodkin added that this feels like a continuation of Valve’s history of hiring on and otherwise supporting mod teams. Difference is, now everybody gets a chance to benefit instead of only a select few:

And modder Giskard chimed in with [this particularly poignant snapshot](http://steamcommunity.com/app/72850/discussions/0/611704531888286404/) of the longstanding tensions between some Steam community members and modders:

> Players have been flaming modders for years, they rarely say thank you and hardly ever use a donate button. So paying for mods offers some compensation for the abuse we get.
> 
> 
> I personally could make a million from selling my mods easily. I have about 30 large quest mods for various Bethesda games and 5 top notch ones for Skyrim. Nexus has nothing that comes close to them. So I could become very rich, very quickly because I am one of the most hard working TES modders on this planet.
> 
> 
> I would share a link to prove it by Steam consider modders that talk about their work on here to be spammers and suspend our accounts if we do it. So your just going to have to use your imaginations.
> 
> 
> Fact is though, Steam has proven time and time again it simply does not understand modders or the modding community. This is just the latest but of proof that the concept of a fun hobbit is beyond them. I removed my work from steam last year because i felt they wanted the benefit of hosting mods without wanting to give modders the support we expect. So I walked away.
> 
> 
> Sadly this charging for mods opens the door to flaming, court cases, fraud and reasons to steal mods to make a buck. But it is also an opportunity, your going to find out who the real modders are, your going consider it a badge of honour to be a free mod maker. And hopefully your going to treat us better than you have been because if you dont, we can always sell our mods and become rich at your expense. This could be thing that makes modding communities friendly again..... lets hope so.

Others voiced more general support, accepting that any launch will be rocky, but solid fundamental ideas will (hopefully) win the day.

no, it doesn’t. just because a mod is being sold doesn’t mean it’s good. this is the problem people had with Steam Greenlight and that same problem will happen here as well.

For now, we’ll just have to wait and see exactly what comes of this. There are still tons of unanswered questions, but one thing’s for sure: this is big. The risks are big, the potential rewards are big. The highs are stratospheric, the lows are apocalyptic. In an ideal world, mods will function like smaller games: some will cost a little money, others will be free. By and large, everything will settle out to a happy midpoint. It’s tough to say, though. Mods are a different animal with extremely different DNA, different culture, different baggage, and Valve’s system certainly isn’t perfect yet (see: people trying to sell other people’s stuff, etc). What do you think? Are we on the cusp of something great, or terrible?

Modders should get paid for their time and effort.

Having said that, people will pirate mods now.

Lets get this straight -”Official” game content you would pay for.

But mods you don’t think are worth paying for?

In essence they are freelance DLC. Cause that is what Valve is turning it into.

And what would differentiate something like “Falskaar” from a DLC like Dawnguard or Dragonborn?

Or the upcoming Luftahraan and SkyWind? Or Helgen Reborn?

I don’t think it would be entirely unfair to pay for that. (Leaving aside how much its worth paying for...)

They’re not even close to developers. At best they’re small-time hobbyists, and that’s only if the mod in question actually requires code work. Even on those that do, most use modified scripts already available, or simply change values in a particular table. The vast majority of mods are simple model or texture work, which isn’t even the same category as development.

I don’t see how this kills anything. Mods will be made. Always, and if no one buys a great mod, or not many buy it, then the price will need to be lowered or removed for some to want it.

I think the biggest thing will be the difference between MLP red kind of dragons in skyrim, or a total conversion like project reality for bf2.

One will be paid for, and justifiably so, and the other will need to do better or more for my money.

The best mods end up being standalone anyways, which get paid for. This is just a middle step. Supplemental to donations.

Lastly, I see many mods not going up on steam simply in protest, but also because some people don't want money to go to the developer, say in instances like dark souls two, with the dsmod that was required to even play the game on PC. Pretty sure the modders of that hate the Devs of dark souls, especially after they fix their game, and then release it as a whole new game with a few added things, one being a new subtitle.

Right now my biggest concern is with the mods already being sold by people who did not develop them. Grab a mod off a web site, slap it on the Steam marketplace, watch the pennies roll in...

What is the end game for this? Mod DRM? Not enough vomit in the world.

The ripoff artists are what's going to kill modding in the end, not the rare honest hobbyist who just wants a shot at beer money.

Just like those smarties were supposed to fix the CA water crisis or get us off fossil fuels like 20 years ago. "Oh science will figure it out!" I like to dream too, but get real. The money it would cosg Valve just to employ a handful of part-time mod policemen would never be worth it compared to just letting the market go to shit around them while they take the money and run.

How's the policing of unauthorized clones working out on mobile platforms? Great right? Yeah no.

How can you authenticate something that is openly free to anyone?

When are they going to figure this authentication out, when many people already stole mods and charged them as if they were their own?

Even then all they have to do is change a color palette and it’s an original mod.

There is no way any of this is going to end well.

They better not start charging for unofficial patches.

Why not? Is the time the devs put in to make the unofficial patch somehow worth less than a regular modder?

If it's an unofficial patch, and the dev wants to charge money for it, yes? That dev didn't force you to buy a broken game, and if you wanted you could just as easily make your own unofficial patch for it. So again, is their time worth less just because of the product they decide to make?

Here’s what I don’t get:

We generally accept that game developers should be paid for their work, right? Whether they’re working on coding the engine, scripting, modeling, level building, etc., nobody would expect a game developer to work for free if they feel their work is worth money, right?

So why is charging for mods beyond the pale, when modders do literally all of that except for engine coding?

The difference is that modders don’t feel the need to get paid. If they did they wouldn’t still be making free mods this far into an era of modding. And while most modders do ask for donations, for the most part, they’re doing it as a hobby and in many cases they only wanted to make a mod for themselves, which turned out so well that they published it.

Probably a perception based on the previous 20+ years of them doing it for free / for the fun of if / as a hobby / etc. Kind of like how people used to make Youtube videos, before the days of “channels” and “monetization”. Before the first thought upon seeing some new thing was “but how can I make money off this?”

“So why is charging for mods beyond the pale, when modders do literally all of that except for engine coding?”

Because modding isnt a job. Modding has always been done for the love of the product, or sometimes as a virtual part of a job application. Nobody ever payed their electric bill with their donations from a mod. Thats the heart of the argument, that they are changing it from something done for love and fun to enhance or change a game that maybe you get a few bucks for, INTO a job.

This is Twitch charging you money to watch a stream instead of having a donate button. Or someone holding the door for you and expecting $1. Or, perhaps more appropriately, Steam charging you a $10 a month subscription fee. When you start charging $ for something that has throughout history been considered free, you alienate them. Which is exactly what you see happening here.

Because making mods for games is apparently a privilege and a hobby, and not deserving of any type of compensation. Just like if a person makes stuff as an amateur carpenter, they should be happy someone takes the stuff off their hands for free... Oh wait...

It’s a flawed system, loads of exploits and issues, but, modders should make money on their efforts.

This hopefully can be a viable route to a steady income, and a space for new developers to start out.

It may also prompt publishers who didn’t support mods, to do so in the future.

I do think some modders should be compensated, sure, but there are a lot of mods that are just glorified cosmetics, slight reskins of existing assets or just plain broken.

Given Steam’s track record with addressing flawed systems like Green Light and Early Access, I wouldn’t count on it getting better.

You really think big publishers won’t copy this bullshit and make it worse? They’ve already done it with early access and free to play. Anything bad can and will be made worse by AAA publishers.

If those things are broken and not worth buying, then people won’t buy them. It’s the same with any product, but that doesn’t mean they’re free.

I think the issues are with the possible exploitation of this system, and that is what needs work. But I have no problem with modders charging for work that they have done.

I’m not a fan of exploiting creative fields, especially those just starting or entering industries. Many will try and justify not paying, for “exposure” which is complete bullshit. People should get paid for the work that they do.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m not 100% opposed to this idea, but its already off to a terrible start. It wreaks of the same problems Early Access and Green Light have always had. Mods are also a lot trickier to sell because several different mods rely on assets from other mods. So how do they split up the revenue if one mod takes assets from 5 others? Bethesda and Valve already get 75% of everything the mod makes. So at what point does the modder actually make any money? Personally it just seems pointless to go along with this program. Because the level of shadiness involved insults both the modders and the PC gaming community at large.

I don’t think anyone would argue that it’s all going to be a-okay, Valve will do everyone good and the publishers won’t try and screw anyone.

But the solution to this should not be that modders should just work for free. It should be a push back against terrible policies and possible exploitation, so that modders can make the money on their work that they deserve.

Here’s the problem though;

I’ve contributed to a total conversion mod, specifically for Skyrim, a mod that has hundreds if not thousands of content contributors, that’s a labor of love, not profit. But who gets paid if it gets sold? The few founders? Or everyone? If it’s everyone, the only way anyone is going to make a worthwhile profit off of it, is by selling it at a high price point, and I don’t think many people would be willing to fork over that kind of money for a mod.

I think this kind of marketplace will ruin it for the more ambitious projects, because you need so many people to make a total conversion mod, or anything similar. If it’s not free for the gamers, how are you going to get that many people to work on it? Because it’ll be impossible to get that many people to work on something, that only a few people get a profit from. And it’ll be impossible to sell it at such a price that everyone gets a profit from it.

I can see this Workshop Store work for small to medium sized projects, but the big total-conversion mods require so many people to work on them, that I just don’t see how you can do it without it being free.

It just means alternative angles can be taken.

For a full conversion, if some one has a plans of assembling one, they can be upfront and pay you for yours.

Let’s say you create a particle mod, someone offers you $20 use it in a full conversion. You can agree or negotiate, the value will be defined by you, and the worth defined by the person driving the main mod.

It’s like standard development. You pay for the separate parts, in the hope that your returns on the final product cover the investment.

I think the current cut sucks. Modders should get at least 30% gross, same as Valve do. But charging money is a new option for some, it could provide people with jobs that they actually have an interest in.

> Let’s say you create a particle mod, someone offers you $20 use it in a full conversion.

Or, alternatively, they just tell you to go fuck yourself and they use your mod in their full conversion without giving you anything. Or they find a particle mod on Nexus from some author who’s no longer active and use that. Or they take your particle mod and slap their name on it and host it on Steam, and then file a complaint against you for stealing “their” work.

All of these things WILL happen, because Valve isn’t going to inspect tens of thousands of lines of code, or hire teams of lawyers to research derivative copyright scenarios. Hell, Steam is selling games _right now_ that contain stolen assets. You really think they’re going to spend any energy policing mods? Especially when they have a financial interest in ignoring any complaints?

Then they can do that, and you can take the logical actions to combat the use of your mod. Or, they can go use someone elses.

None of this stuff is specific only to modding, this is basically the same problems that any creative venture has. The ownership of work, the appropriate compensation and so on. It’s just modders, now with money involved, will have to handle those situations, too.

Ultimately, people should get paid for their work.

Yes but these mods are done as a hobby. By having to negotiate payment you might have to involve lawyers if the mod takes off. Contracts will have to be drafted up. Creators will see their work more valuable than others and demand more pay or hold out knowing you need their assets. Do you pay them a one time payment? or do they get a royalty from them? Suddenly it becomes afull time job just to make sure your legally safe.

All these questions change the landscape off the business, soon just wanting to have something added for fun into your game of Skyrim is a nightmare for both customers and potential modders.

I absolutely adore the people saying modders aren’t on par with developers while there are _actual developers_ saying that they are, like the tweet from Azrael up there.

The _developers_ for Skyrim didn’t make the game completely from scratch. Even the Creation Engine used to create the game was based off of the Havok Engine, developed by not-Bethesda. They put in most of the work, sure, but everything was laid on top of an existing framework, the same as a cataclysmically large majority of every video game ever developed. I’m not talking about someone who puts assets from Assassin’s Creed into Oblivion - as I explained elsewhere, that’s a hole in Steam’s current system that needs fixing - but if someone makes their own models, scripts sequences, maps terrain, or anything similar, it’s entirely on par with what developers are doing and they have every right to request people buy it instead of giving it out for free.

I just don’t see it. I’m sure there were ways to sell that stuff before. What changed? People that didn’t want to still won’t, people who wanted to now have an easier way.

That said, I highly doubt it’ll “kill” the community. Maybe the opposite. Don’t people think guys who spend close to 10 years remaking Half-Life on Source deserve a few dollars?

thats not really a mod though, that’s literally just remaking another game in another engine, like making a painting of a painting.

If they deserved a few dollars, then that’s what a donation button is for. If people think you do good work, they will donate simple as that. The people who remade Half Life on source chose to do that for fun and because they wanted to, they weren’t expecting a paycheck, if they were then they would be working at a game studio, not doing it on their own free time.

Well, in this case I think it can be rather easily sued for copyright infringement by Vavle, who would probably consider doing such a thing if it was priced. And it is called a “mod”, although I technically agree.

I wouldn’t pay for any mod I’ve ever installed. The guy who thinks he could make a million because his mods are heavily downloaded apparently has no idea how hard it is to convince people to pay for something when it goes from free to paid.

You’d actually be surprised how shockingly easy it is to get them to pay for it. People are sheep. They fall for this sort of “premium” schtick all the time. That’s why a bizarre number of people take part in paid game microtransactions and copious micro-DLC.

Some people yes. Enough to make $4000000? (Remember that he only gets 25% so he needs 4x his expected return.) No
