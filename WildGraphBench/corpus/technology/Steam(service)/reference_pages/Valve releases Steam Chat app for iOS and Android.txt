Valve has released a new standalone mobile app incorporating many of the chat features of its desktop client, which underwent a [major refresh](https://web.archive.org/web/20220702054308/https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17609872/steam-chat-new-features-roll-put-discord-like-competition) last year in an attempt to compete with Discord. The new mobile app, which is available for [iOS](https://web.archive.org/web/20220702054308/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://itunes.apple.com/app/steam-chat/id1434890245?t=1) and [Android](https://web.archive.org/web/20220702054308/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.valvesoftware.android.steam.friendsui), includes rich chat features, group chats, customizable notifications, and more. Voice chat is a notable omission at present, though Valve says it’s working on it.

This is Valve’s second major iOS app launch in less than seven days. Last week the long-delayed Steam Link app, which lets users [beam Steam games](https://web.archive.org/web/20220702054308/https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/3/18286931/steam-games-stream-how-to-valve-link-anywhere-in-home-streaming) from their desktop PC to an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV, was [finally approved](https://web.archive.org/web/20220702054308/https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18627110/steam-link-app-ios-apple-tv-released) by Apple after having been rejected almost a year previously.
