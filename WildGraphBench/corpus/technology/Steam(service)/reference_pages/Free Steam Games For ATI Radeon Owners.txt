 Valve has announced that effective immediately, ATI Radeon owners can download a free copy of Half-Life 2: Lost Coast and Half-Life 2: Deathmatch through [Steam](http://www.steampowered.com/ati_offer1a/). The software will automatically confirm the presence of ATI Radeon hardware and offer access to the two games. 
In related news, Steam will be included with the ATI Catalyst driver and software suit until early 2008 and ATI Radeon HD 2900 XT owners will, upon release, receive Team Fortress 2, Portal, and Half-Life 2: Episode Two through Valve's content delivery application.
