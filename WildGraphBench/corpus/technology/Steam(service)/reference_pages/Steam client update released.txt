 Client Update - Valve 

Jul 1, 2010

 A Steam client update is now available. To apply the update, click the File menu inside of Steam and then select "Check for Steam Client Updates...". The specific changes include:

**Steam Client**

*   Added UI to disable Steam Cloud per-game and per-account.

*   Added an icon in list view for uninstalled games that support cloud.

*   Steam Cloud will now download files for installed games on logon.

*   Fixed Steam Cloud sync failures that occurred because of deleted files.

*   Improve text hit testing in chat windows.

*   Make player names in chat windows clickable, taking you to that user's profile.

*   Fixed tabs in the settings dialog sometimes not drawing correctly.

*   Fixed a regression that prevented steam from automatically validating and repairing damaged game caches on launch.

*   Shortened the delay between launching steam and being offered offline mode in the case of no network connectivity.

*   Fixes the label under the dropdown on the game properties updates page for non-cloud games.

*   Shows the "cloud disabled" icon in list view for games with cloud disabled that are not installed.

*   Fixes the login button in the login dialog becoming enabled when the dialog is dragged after the button is pressed.

*   Improves whitespace detection in chats.

*   Fixes weirdness with radio buttons when pressing the 'back' key on the backup wizard.

*   Fixes game manuals not opening in an external browser.

*   [OSX] Makes player names in chat windows clickable
