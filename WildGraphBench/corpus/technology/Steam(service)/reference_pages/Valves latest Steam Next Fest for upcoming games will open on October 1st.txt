Steam Next Fest is coming October 1st

Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge

Valve announced Friday that its [latest Steam Next Fest](https://web.archive.org/web/20220702053315/https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest) is coming the first week of October, giving access to playable demos of hundreds of upcoming PC games.

A video teaser showed glimpses of a few games to expect to see in demo, including _Airhead_ from Octato Games, _Unexplored 2: The Wayfarer’s Legacy_ from Ludomotion, _ANNO:Mutationem_ from Thinking Stars, _Mahokenshi_ from Game Source Studio, _Starship Troopers— Terran Command_ from The Artistocrats,_Life of Delta_ from Airo Games, and more. And [IGN reported](https://web.archive.org/web/20220702053315/https://za.ign.com/no-mans-sky/157295/news/the-last-campfire-from-the-creators-of-no-mans-sky-has-a-steam-release-date) that _The Last Campfire_, from Hello Games, the creators of _No Man’s Sky_, will also have a playable demo available as part of Next Fest.

Gamers can “explore the latest from veteran devs and first-timers alike,” according to the promotional video.

Valve has been holding these online events for PC games every few months to try to fill the void of the in-person gaming and developer events that have been canceled or postponed by the coronavirus pandemic. Originally called the Steam Game Festival, Valve [changed the name](https://web.archive.org/web/20220702053315/https://www.pcgamesn.com/steam/next-fest-dates) to Steam Next Fest with its June 2021 event. For developers, it’s a chance to get feedback directly from fans about their upcoming games, because in addition to giving player access to game demos, the event will include livestreams with developers.

Steam Next Fest opens October 1st at 1PM ET, and runs through October 7th.
