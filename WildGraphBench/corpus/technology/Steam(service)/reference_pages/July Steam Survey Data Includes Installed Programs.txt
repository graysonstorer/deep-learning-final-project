 Each month Valve publishes a report of the data collected by the voluntary Steam user survey. Up to now it profiled hardware, providing an interesting look at the breakdown of things like processor speeds and video cards among those participating. Starting with July, Valve added installed software to the data automatically gathered from those who opt in. For now, only Windows users are included; Mac data is promised as coming soon. 
So what's out there on those Windows machines? Abobe's Flash Player and Acrobat lead the pack with 97% and 73% install rate respectively. Firefox is up next at 63%, handily trouncing competing browsers Internet Explorer at 20% and Chrome at 12%. WinRAR is the most popular archive utility, installed on 45% of the PCs. 7-Zip comes in a distant second at 18%. Adobe's AIR platform seems to have caught on well, with 41% of those reporting having it installed on their boxes. And, of course, there's BitTorrent clients, led by uTorrent, which showed up on 29% of the surveys.

You can check out the full results, along with all the usual stats in the [Steam Hardware and Software Survey: July 2010](http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/).

uTorrent opens for my Blizzard patches, because Blizzard's own torrenting software is hella lame. 

Also apparently the browser I use doesn't exist according to Steam. :3
