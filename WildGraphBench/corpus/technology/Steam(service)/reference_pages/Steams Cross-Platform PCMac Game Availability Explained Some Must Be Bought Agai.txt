[Steam's PC/Mac 'Steam Play' Game Availability Explained (Update: Civ 4 Issues Resolved)](http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/63793)
======================================================================================================================================

by Chris Faylor May 13, 2010 5:24pm CST tags: [Steam](http://www.shacknews.com/tag.x/Steam), [Valve](http://www.shacknews.com/tag.x/Valve), [Mac](http://www.shacknews.com/tag.x/Mac), [PC Gaming](http://www.shacknews.com/tag.x/PC+Gaming)

 [**Update** - 7:20pm CST] Those that previously bought Civilization IV and its expansions via Steam PC will now have [free access](http://store.steampowered.com/news/3827/) to the games on Steam for Mac. 
Additionally, Valve has now updated the [list of games](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9439-QHKN-1308) that "offer cross-platform support, regardless of purchase date" to include Fairway Solitaire. Assuming the list is now accurate, that means all of the Steam Mac games Valve's promoted thus far are available to previous Steam PC owners without the need for an additional purchase.

[**Original**] - When Valve launched Steam for Mac yesterday, the company boasted a list of over [fifty launch games](http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/63759) for the digital distribution platform, noting that one could play any of the launch titles "on all Steam supported platforms" with a single purchase.

However, it [turns out](https://support.steampowered.com/kb_article.php?ref=9439-QHKN-1308) that this functionality, referred to as Steam Play, doesn't always extend to all of one's past Steam PC purchases--if you bought a game on Steam PC before it was eligible, you may have to buy again if you want it on Steam Mac.

Thus far, only two of the fifty-plus offerings--Civilization IV: The Complete Edition and Fairway Solitaire--require existing Steam PC owners to rebuy them on Steam Mac if they were bought before "being eligible for Steam Play support (May 12th, 2010)."

To help make matters more clear, Valve issued the following list of the current Steam for Mac games that "offer cross-platform support, regardless of purchase date."

While all of the games currently available through Steam for Mac support Steam Play, Valve has [previously cautioned](http://www.shacknews.com/onearticle.x/62687) that it may not be universally supported across the entire Steam catalog, noting the functionality would be available "for our games and any of our partners who are interested in using the feature." _[Thanks CoRDS](http://www.shacknews.com/laryn.x?id=22937968#itemanchor\_22937968)_[](http://www.shacknews.com/laryn.x?id=22937968#itemanchor_22937968)
