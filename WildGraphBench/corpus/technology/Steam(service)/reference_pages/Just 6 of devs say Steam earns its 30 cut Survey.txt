[![Image 14: A set of bar graphs show the percentage of sales that comes from storefronts like Steam, GOG, Humble, and Kartridge](https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/salesbreakdown.png/BROK/resize/720%3E/format/jpg/quality/70/salesbreakdown.png)](https://assets.reedpopcdn.com/salesbreakdown.png/BROK/resize/1920x1920%3E/format/jpg/quality/80/salesbreakdown.png)

For years, Valve has thrived by taking a 30% cut of all revenues developers bring in through Steam, but the company is facing pushback against that practice from a number of directions lately.

Aggressive new challengers like the Epic Games store and Discord store have embraced [more developer-friendly revenue splits](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/discord-store-offering-developers-a-90-10-revenue-split), big publishers are increasingly willing [to launch big PC titles without Steam](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-forgoes-steam-in-favour-of-the-epic-games-store-for-the-division-2), and now many developers just don't see themselves getting much bang for the buck on that 30% cut.

The organizers of the Game Developers Conference released the results of their annual State of the Game Industry survey today, showing that just 6% of nearly 4,000 respondents believe that Steam justifies the 30% cut it takes from developers. That's compared to 32% who said "No" when asked if it does enough to earn that share, and 27% who said "Probably not." 17% answered "Maybe," with another 17% in the "Not sure / don't know" category. (The study was conducted from November 27 to December 19. Shortly after the survey began, Valve [reduced its revenue split on particularly successful games](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/valve-adds-revenue-share-tiers-for-developers).)

Negative sentiment aside, Steam was the most popular PC/Mac storefront for developers surveyed, with 47% selling their games through it. The next most-common way for developers to get their games to customers was by selling directly through their own site (26%). Publisher-owned outfits like EA's Origin or Battle.net were collectively used by 18% of respondents, the same amount that reported selling games through Itch.io. After that came names like Humble (17%), GOG (14%), and Discord (6%).

The survey also identified some interesting dynamics about where developers' business was coming from. Of the developers who sold their games on Steam, 55% reported that Valve's storefront accounted for 75% or more of their sales. Developers on GOG, Discord, Humble, and Kartridge rarely reported those platforms contributing heavily to sales, with only single-digit percentages of developers reporting receiving more than half their revenue from any one of those stores. However, publisher-owned storefronts (36%), developer's direct sales sites (41%), and Itch.io (29%) more commonly accounted for 75% or more of their games' sales.

As for platforms, PC is still dominant, with 66% of respondents currently developing for it. Smartphones and tablets were the next most common platform at 38%, followed by PlayStation 4 and Pro (31%), Xbox One and X (28%), and Macs (20%). Though the Switch trailed at 18%, interest in developing for the handheld hybrid was up year-over-year. 16% of respondents said they were making their next project for current and as-yet unannounced platforms, while 2% said their next game would be exclusively for unannounced platforms.

The full State of the Games Industry survey covers a variety of additional topics, including [unionization and work hours](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/only-16-percent-of-devs-anti-union-survey), and can be downloaded from [the official website](http://reg.gdconf.com/GDC-State-of-Game-Industry-2019).
