**Update 29/08/25 - 16:59 UTC**: since there's reports of it still working even with a Debit Card and not just a Credit Card (they're different in the UK), I've asked Valve if they have any comments on this. Since in the UK, even a preteen can get a Debit Card.

**Update #2 - 19:33 UTC** - Valve press replied to GamingOnLinux to confirm allowing Debit Cards for verification was a bug, which has now been solved.

* * *

Valve recently put up a new support page, detailing the steps they've taken to comply with the UK Online Safety Act.

The UK Online Safety Act has a rather broad scope, and has been the cause of many changes not just for UK citizens but people worldwide as more and more websites realise they're in scope of the act and have to make changes. It covers all sorts of thing from porn to community forums and more. And yes, that even includes video games too (which many developers likely aren't even aware of). If a video game has user to user communication (voice / text chat) and it's available in the UK, the developer will need to comply with it.

The likes of Reddit, Bluesky, Discord, Xbox and more have already rolled out verification systems.

To comply with it, Valve will now be requiring users from the UK to have a valid credit card stored on their account. Valve will do a direct check (that costs £0 to users) using their own internal payment processing system "which is independently certified under the PCI-DSS standard".

If you don't do this you won't be able to access "Steam store pages for mature content games as well as their associated community hubs".

In the UK, you have to be at least 18 to have a credit card, so this way does make a lot of sense - as you'll already be age verified if you have a credit card in your name. Valve additionally say that "Having the credit card stored as a payment method acts as an additional deterrent against circumventing age verification by sharing a single Steam user account among multiple persons".

Valve feel this way "preserves the maximum degree of user privacy" as the data they will process during this is no different to simply making a purchase on Steam. It's also only required if you've specifically opted into seeing mature content on Steam.

 They should start selling special 18+ versions of their steam wallet cards in shops.

 If a credit card is good enough, those should also do fine.

 Better than having show ID to some shady online service that might or might not lose your data, sell it, or keep it forever.

 But geesh, remember when we used to look down on certain non-Western countries with intrusive mass-surveillance programs, and called them "unfree"?

 Heads up that a debit card also works fine, if you don't have a credit card. Although it bills you £1, rather than presumably £0 for a Credit Card. ![Image 21: emoji](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/emoticons/grin.png)

 Honestly I can't help but view this as being actively _worse_ than regular ID requirements. Yes, being 18 means you can get a credit card _in theory_ but in practice you have to meet a slog of metrics and prerequistes and questionnaires before places will even CONSIDER letting you have one. Actually obtaining one is even more impossible than someone getting Photo ID without having previously had some form of it as a child or possessing one of those mythical "family friends". This kind of this just actively makes the whole siutation worse to me.

 If it's true that a debit card also works, Valve will have to fix that, even preteens can have a debit card in the UK.

 Shame they don't use Nexus Mods' technique and use the age of the account. My Steam account is 19 years old. Surprisingly so is my Nexus Mods account, didn't realise I'd gotten in that early.

 Actually, if the check doesn't cost anything can't kids just steal their parent's credit card?

 What happens when you've got poor credit and no active credit cards? Like if you lose a job due to no fault of your own, can't pay your bills anymore, and that tanks your credit? You now can't verify your age at all, and then can't buy adult content if that's your interest. Meanwhile, some pissant spoiled teenager can have their parent's credit card on there and just lie about their age to access whatever content they want.

 I've emailed Valve for clarification, since there's growing reports on Debit Cards working for it.

 Well, they could just have said "flock this, no mature game for the UK", or worse, 

 just block the UK period.

 (it's a stupid law IMHO, and it's gonna bite them on the backside at some point)

 (after a data breach. you **know** that's gonna happen)

 Just check, my steam acct is 16 now. :D

 I doubt they can do anything about it, seems to just be a weird quirk of UK payment processors. Google is the same, you can use a debit card their too.

 Edit: Looks like they've added an additional check, so debit cards don't work now. It only applies to Adult-Only games anyway, stuff like CyberPunk 2077 and Far Cry 3 with nudity are unaffected, just porn games.

 It would be fun if they extend that worldwide as almost no one has a credit card in France. What we called a credit card act like a debit card when doing payment in other country.

 So i have to wonder what kind of backend monitoring will eventually be in place for private chats now that is linked to your physical identity. Given the nature of who has forced these changes ? I can imagine a scenario where vast datasets are being swept through and personal profiles are being built on peoples current and previously stored history ? Although i expect this has been happening to console users for years. Probably Paranoid , but something feels different about all this stuff this time round ![Image 39: emoji](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/templates/default/images/emoticons/unsure.png)

 can we go back to the early 2000's late 1990's please.

> with a Debit Card and not just a Credit Card (they're different in the UK)

Are they not different everywhere? A debit card lets you access money in a specific bank account, a credit card extends a loan that can be more than you have available to cover it at the time.

> Shame they don't use Nexus Mods' technique and use the age of the account.

I see a few problems there; while an old account _may_ signify an old user*, a young account does not necessarily signify a _young_ user – a 50-year-old could get a Steam account for the first time this year.

 *And even this may not be the case as people pass on their old Steam accounts to their kids/younger relations (yes I know it's against Valve's terms and conditions, I also know that doesn't stop it happening). Or people could simply start selling old accounts, like iPhones with Flappy Bird installed on them.

 Update #2 - Valve press replied to GamingOnLinux to confirm allowing Debit Cards for verification was a bug, which has now been solved.

 'Solved' feels like it needs very heavy quotation marks around it, but I digress. If the UK govt. really is going to stick with this, they need to actually roll out some kind of national ID system again that is free or at least not nearly £100 to sign up for and doesn't require absurd prerequistes that a first time provisional or passport needs. Otherwise this is going to get wildly out of hand and unbearable so very fast.

 If I had to predict, I'd claim this would not be improved any time soon. It's not like the UK government cares about poor people.

 Although widely used in various European countries, the UK has been historically icky about implementing national Identity card. Typically for civil liberties reasons. 

 a physical 'card' is becoming outmoded, & we could expect a mandatory proprietary Andriod / IOS Identification 'App' with all the associated tracking. Yes it will be easier to update your facial / bio metric identity using an app and also verify yourself in a variety of interesting and useful ways. there comes with it a list of potentially harmful possibilities of course.

 Still, i expect were only a year or two away from this. Five at best.
