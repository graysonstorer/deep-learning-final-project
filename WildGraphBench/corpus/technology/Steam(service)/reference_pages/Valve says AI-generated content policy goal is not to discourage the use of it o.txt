"We know it is a constantly evolving tech."

Last week, a Steam developer suggested Valve was banning games featuring AI-generated content on its platform, after reporting that their game had been rejected for using "fairly obviously AI-generated" assets.

The developer was given a second chance to resubmit their game but said, via [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/aigamedev/comments/142j3yt/valve_is_not_willing_to_publish_games_with_ai/), that this was also rejected - due to them not owning the necessary rights.

Now, in a statement provided to Eurogamer, Valve has clarified a few points on this post, and provided further insight into how it will police AI-generated content on Steam in general.

Valve stated it was continuing to learn about AI, as well as the ways it can be used in game development and how it will factor in when the company reviews the games it allows on Steam.

"Our priority, as always, is to try to ship as many of the titles we receive as we can," Valve said, noting the introduction of AI may make this process harder as it is not always easy to know when a developer has "sufficient rights in using AI to create assets, including images, text, and music".

Valve then touched on the legal uncertainty around the use of certain AI generated assets, stating "it is the developer's responsibility to make sure they have the appropriate rights to ship their game".

Valve continued: "We know it is a constantly evolving tech, and our goal is not to discourage the use of it on Steam; instead, we're working through how to integrate it into our already-existing review policies. Stated plainly, our review process is a reflection of current copyright law and policies, not an added layer of our opinion. As these laws and policies evolve over time, so will our process."

Valve said it will continue to "welcome and encourage innovation" on its platform, understanding that AI technology is bound to play a part in this. However, it reiterated that "while developers can use these AI technologies in their work with appropriate commercial licences", they "can not infringe on existing copyrights".

Valve's statement closed: "Lastly, while App-submission credits are usually non-refundable, we're more than happy to offer them in these cases as we continue to work on our review process."

AI is a hot topic of discussion across the video game industry right now. Several developers have flirted with this new technology, with the likes of Ubisoft announcing its [Ghostwriter AI tool earlier this year](https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-sparks-debate-by-unveiling-ai-tool-to-aid-scriptwriting). The High on Life team also used [AI to create video game voice dialogue](https://www.eurogamer.net/high-on-life-contains-ai-art-and-voice-acting).

Meanwhile, [System Shock](https://www.eurogamer.net/games/system-shock) publisher Prime Matter got into some hot water earlier in the year, when it used [AI generated art as a marketing stunt for the remake](https://www.eurogamer.net/apparently-system-shock-dev-used-ai-to-create-ai-to-start-conversations).

Additionally, several prolific video game voice actors have discussed their scepticism of whether AI can truly replicate human performances and what its impact could be on the voice acting industry, including [Jane Perry, Troy Baker](https://www.eurogamer.net/voice-actors-remain-sceptical-about-the-use-of-ai-in-gaming), [Jennifer Hale and David Hayter](https://www.eurogamer.net/solid-snake-and-commander-shepard-stars-discuss-threat-of-ai-on-voice-acting).

The team working on Amazon's live-action God of War series is growing.

As reported by [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/12/god-of-war-frederick-eo-toye-production-casting-2-season-order-1236630007/), Emmy winning director Frederick E.O. Toye will direct the first two episodes of the upcoming God of War series.

Toye has worked on a number of acclaimed shows during his expansive career, including Westworld, The Boys and The Walking Dead. He is also no stranger to video game adaptations, having additionally helmed episodes of Amazon's Fallout series.

Last year, Toye won the Emmy for outstanding directing for a drama series for historical drama Shōgun's ninth episode, Crimson Sky.

The director joins showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore on Amazon's God of War series. Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only [joining the project towards the end of last year](https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer) following the [departure of the original team](https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs). Despite the shakeup, PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, Sony's Hermen Hulst, Vertigo's Roy Lee and of course Sony Santa Monica head Cory Barlog remain involved with the project. Santa Monica's Jeff Ketcham is also a co-executive producer on Amazon's God of War adaptation.

Pre-production for the show is now underway in Vancouver, and casting for the God of War series has begun. Do you have any thoughts on who may play who?

Meanwhile, while we still don't have a release window for the first season, a [second season of God of War has already been greenlit at Amazon](https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written). To quote Kratos, "Boy!"
