Valve removes arbitration from its Steam agreements — here’s what that means for you
====================================================================================

Millions of Steam users woke up this morning with a notice from Valve: The multi-faceted gaming company updated its Steam Subscriber Agreement to remove a requirement that disputes go to arbitration as opposed to court. Now, if you have a dispute, you’re required to take the company to federal or state court in King County, Washington.

Legal experts consider this a win for Steam users, even if most of them will likely never take Valve to court. Consumers are usually required in such agreements to arbitrate and not sue — at least, in the United States. Previously, Valve forced its disputes into arbitration — when a third party reviews an issue to resolve it outside of the legal system. The update also removed Valve’s class-action waiver, which means class-action lawsuits from a group of people with the same complaint are now on the table.

“We’ve eliminated the requirement that disputes be resolved by individual arbitration,” Valve wrote in a news release. “As always, we encourage you to contact Steam Support when you have any issues, as that will nearly always be the best way to reach a solution. But if that doesn’t work, the updated SSA now provides that any disputes are to go forward in court instead of arbitration. We’ve also removed the class action waiver, as well as the cost and fee-shifting provisions, that were in prior versions of the SSA.”

Arbitration became a national headline earlier this year after Jeffrey Piccolo sued Disney and an on-site restaurant following his wife’s death; she died after having an allergic reaction after dinner, despite telling the restaurant about her allergies to dairy and nuts. Disney responded to the lawsuit by arguing Piccolo “waived his right to sue when he signed up for a Disney+ streaming account in 2019 and when he used the Disney World website in 2023,” Axios [reported in August](https://www.axios.com/2024/08/21/disney-plus-court-case-arbitration). The public was outraged, [and Disney eventually backpedaled](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/14/nx-s1-5074830/disney-wrongful-death-lawsuit-disney), allowing the suit to continue in court.

Valve’s decision to remove its arbitration clause is notable because most service agreements include an arbitration clause. (However, Greenberg Glusker’s Litigation Group partner Ira Steinberg, told Polygon that there’s currently a “trend of companies reconsidering arbitration.”)

[✕ Remove Ads](https://www.polygon.com/premium/?ref=ad_removal)

A 1995 Supreme Court decision [expanded the Federal Arbitration Act](https://ballsandstrikes.org/law-politics/federal-arbitration-act-supreme-court-locked-out/), which was originally intended to ensure voluntary arbitration agreements between businesses were upheld, to include consumer contracts with businesses. The Supreme Court [has continued to support consumer-business arbitration](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/column-arbitration-wins-again-us-supreme-court-2023-06-26/) in the decades that followed, making it near-guaranteed on most contracts. The problem with arbitration, [according to the Economic Policy Institute](https://www.epi.org/publication/the-arbitration-epidemic/), is that people must take issues to a “privatized, invisible, and often inferior forum in which they are less likely to prevail.” Typically, consumers don’t have the right to appeal arbitration decisions, either. Arbitration processes vary, but they’re typically ruled over by a third-party arbitrator or tribunal. Cases that go immediately to arbitration are private, which make them preferable to companies, too.

To recap: Steam users can now sue Valve, including with class action lawsuits

Critics of arbitration consider it to be more fair to allow consumers to take a company to court, which is an even, transparent playing field overseen by government officials like judges rather than private parties. Valve, in its update, also removed the class-action waiver, which previously prevented players from filing class-action lawsuits.

To recap: Steam users can now sue Valve, including with class action lawsuits.

So why would Valve do this? It may be a response to several law firms’ attempt to file “mass arbitrations,” wherein “[hundreds or thousands of consumers bringing individual arbitration claims](https://www.classaction.org/steam-antitrust-refund-2023) against the same company at the same time and over the same issue,” according to ClassAction.org. It’s essentially a loophole for class action waivers and arbitration clauses, though it still won’t end up in court. ClassAction.org, a class-action watchdog website, called it a “relatively new” way to take on corporations for consumer disputes. [Several law firms](https://www.bucherlawfirm.com/steam-case-explained) have pursued this option, [one of which was sued by Valve for allegedly attempting to “extort” the company with a threat of mass arbitration](https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/column-mass-arbitration-target-valve-accuses-law-firm-litigation-funder-2023-12-08/) with more than 50,000 people. (This lawsuit was dismissed in August without prejudice, meaning Valve could re-file.)

[✕ Remove Ads](https://www.polygon.com/premium/?ref=ad_removal)

The idea is that the sheer number of arbitration cases would force Valve to settle with all of them with the same resolution, instead of arbitrating them all individually. Arbitration is usually less expensive than litigation, but on this mass scale, it can easily become overwhelming for the company the disputes are with. “In states like California where businesses must pay most of the arbitration fees in a consumer claim, the business would be required to pay a filing fee for each individual claimant,” Steinberg said. “With fees of approximately $1,500 per claim, a claim with thousands of individuals could cost millions in filing fees.”

Valve has not provided any explanation as to why it’s making this change. Polygon has reached out to the company for comment.

Unless you can prove gross negligence, but then you should be suing staff and not the restaurant unless you can prove staff aren’t properly trained.

I don’t live with allergies and it’s really easy for me to say so, but you’re agreeing to take a risk when you eat at places that prepare food that can potentially kill you. Like people who eat blowfish. 2024-09-28 09:17:51   Upvote 2  Downvote Reply 2   Copy

 A lot of this is state by state, in the US. Countries in the UK, and Country by country in the EU with some regulations across the EU. Where they setup rules, and practices that must be followed for restaurants and businesses. 

In most all incidents - you are very right- allergies are the responsibility of the person and not the business, unless regulated so. 

 Even if advertised- like gluten free. Why most all of those restaurants say, that while these ingredients listed are accurate there is no way for them to control all ingredients throughout the production of the food. 

I am a RN, BSN in a tri-city edu dept. 

If say a dish has peanuts and should not have, I would always sue the restaurant, because the individual staff worker- have broad protections for the most part , when employed in the service industry. Or else every 17 yr old would get sued for a sausage an egg biscuit, when they only wanted sausage . Staff workers would be an easy target, because they have little legal resources. So most governments give a reasonable amount of protections to the day to day - non state licensed staff workers. Barring intentional harm, which is a crime. 

I personally feel parents of children, with allergies, should NOT depend on schools, restaurants, etc to create a 'safe' allergic free environment. They should always teach their children how to be wary, how to safe guard, ask questions, have medication, etc when going about life. Kids need to be on as educated as possible, and depend less on others -when it comes to food allergies.  2024-09-28 10:55:55   Upvote 2  Downvote Reply Copy

 From an AP article:

The lawsuit claims Tangsuan and her husband, Jeffrey Piccolo, and his

 mother decided to eat at Raglan Road in October 2023 because it was 

 billed on Disney’s website as having “allergen free food.”

The suit alleges Tangsuan informed their server numerous times that 

 she had a severe allergy to nuts and dairy products, and that the waiter

 “guaranteed” the food was allergen-free.

So... what exactly is your point in this case? 2024-09-28 23:58:28   Upvote 4  Downvote Reply Copy

I Googled as soon as I got the Valve popup, and fortunately this was high on the list.

The Disney case created outrage for 2 reasons: 1) Nobody likes the idea of those countless unread popup agreements actually containing disagreeable content; and 2) people assume 'waived right to sue' is the same as 'waived right to justice'. The 2nd is a misunderstanding. What it really means, is 'waived right to pursue justice in court, because you agreed to instead pursue justice in arbitration'.

Businesses, for their own disputes, have long learned the superiority of private arbitration, because of lower costs and more versatile settlements (including possibly maintaining privacy, where courts tend to make everything public, no matter how ancillary to the disagreement and settlement). And courts are more than happy to support private arbitration, since they are perpetually overwhelmed (and it is a nice vocation for former judges).

What companies like Disney and Steam need to do, is convince consumers that arbitration is in their interests as well, for the same reasons. Certainly, the arbitration industry should be doing more in that regard, as they appear to market themselves only to businesses. Bringing more consumers into arbitration also creates reputation incentives that would improve the consumer experience. 

In the fave of ignorance of a market, there is a perpetual antimarket bias (meaning greater skepticism of market actions than government actions). But this is commonly overcome when individuals have greater exposure to the particular market under suspicion. It is unlikely, afterall, that private arbiters (often former judges) have more bias in a case for a businesse against a consumer, than judges do for a prosecutor against a poor defendent (who 95+% of the time are coerced out of their right to any trial at all). 2024-09-27 19:32:09   Upvote 1  Downvote Reply 3   Copy

 There are people and companies that specialize in arbitration. Their reputation is based on their performance. But since you ask, who picks the arbitrator when you go to court with the government?  2024-09-28 23:56:58   Upvote 1  Downvote Reply Copy
