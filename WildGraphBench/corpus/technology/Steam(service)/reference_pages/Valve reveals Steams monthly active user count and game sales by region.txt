The world’s most powerful PC game distribution platform continues to expand its reach and grow its user base.

Video-game giant Valve showed new stats about the growth of[Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) at the Casual Connect gaming conference in Seattle on Wednesday.

Steam, the preeminent “app store” for PC games, now counts 67 million monthly active players. That’s more than the [53 million](https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://c.s-microsoft.com/en-us/CMSFiles/SlidesFY17Q4.pptx?version=c9735c19-0baa-103d-2a4e-bacd46514428) monthly active users Microsoft reported for Xbox Live last quarter. Steam also has 33 million daily active players. (Apart from monthly active users, Steam’s total user base is much larger: Valve [reported](http://store.steampowered.com/news/21534/) 125 million total active lifetime users last year.)

Another sign of growth: Steam is averaging 14 million concurrent users per day at peak — that’s up from 8.4 million in 2015, according to the presentation this week.

![Image 56: Man with a beard wearing a navy blue, long-sleeved button-down shirt while speaking with a lavalier microphone on stage](https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steamvalve_0219-630x420.jpg)

Tom Giardino, who works in business development at Valve, speaks at Casual Connect on Wednesday in Seattle.

New gamers are flocking to Steam as well. There have been 27 million first-time purchasers — those who created a Steam account and bought a game, or downloaded a free game and made a transaction for the first time — since January 2016. That’s nearly 1.5 million users per month.

“There are lots of users coming into Steam every day,”said Tom Giardino, who works in business development and marketing at Valve.

Bellevue, Wash.-based Valve, [which takes a 30 percent cut of each sale on Steam](https://www.engadget.com/2015/03/13/valve-steam/)and has a substantial influence on the overall PC gaming market — [some say too much](https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/16/15622366/valve-gabe-newell-sales-origin-destructive) — is also seeing rapid growth from users in Asia. A few years ago, Asia only represented a few percentage points of Steam’s worldwide sales. Now that’s up to 17 percent, largely driven by users in Korea, China, and Japan.

![Image 57: Steam sales by region, year-to-date 2017, are shown in a pie chart. North America is 34%, Western Europe is 29%, Asia is 17%, Russian Territories is 5%, Oceania is 4%, and Latin America is 3%. The pie chart is titled Steam Sales ($) by Region, YTD 2017, and the chart is presented on a screen during a VALVE CONFIDENTIAL presentation](https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steamvalve_0187-630x420.jpg)

Giardino said part of the international growth is due to Valve’s efforts to localize stores and accept more payment methods. But it’s also due to the diversity of content available on Steam. He said the variety of games — whether it be a traditional first-person shooter or a point-and-click adventure — that can be successful on Steam is “kind of astounding.” The selection helps draw in new customers, which then incentivizes game developers for that particular region or genre.

“We see it as one of the platform’s biggest assets,” Giardino said of Steam’s robust library.

![Image 58: A slide show reads: STEAM IS A DIFFERENT KIND OF OPPORTUNITY, Great games find their audience, Huge variety of business models, Huge variety in scope, style, mechanics, We don't sell ad space or pick winners & losers, and Valve Confidential](https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steamvalve_0190-630x420.jpg)

Steam, available on PC, Mac, or Linux, is designed to ensure that “great games find their audience dynamically and automatically,” Giardino noted. The recommendation engine shows users games tailored to their preferences — the language they speak, the type of games they’ve been playing, what games their friends play, etc. — rather than which developer spent the most on marketing, for example.

Part of Valve’s pitch to developers is the influence Steam provides, and the creative flexibility the platform offers.

“When you launch a game on Steam, you are less focused on figuring out the right metric to trick players into coming back for a second go, and more focused on delighting them and making sure they have a great time playing your game,” Giardino said.

![Image 59: A slide show, “TAKEAWAY,” says that Steam can help the viewer connect with a huge global audience that is growing and hungry for all kinds of games](https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steamvalve_0233-630x420.jpg)![Image 60: A slide presentation showcases A Games-First Client & Library, featuring a selection of games like Offence: Fight Till the Last Drop, Danger Zone, Dead Cells, Dota 2, Drifting Lands, Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator, and Foxhole](https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steamvalve_0235-630x420.jpg)![Image 61: Slide that says An Open Platform followed by The PC space thrives on openness and innovation. and Steam capitalizes on the fact that PCs are not just tools for consumption, but also creation.](https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steamvalve_0234-630x420.jpg)

Matching Steam users with the right content is something Valve CEO Gabe Newell [noted during a Reddit AMA](https://www.geekwire.com/2017/gabe-newell-talks-future-valve-offers-advice-game-developers/) in January. “I’m thinking about how machine learning applies to connecting users and content (and users in optimal ways),” he wrote. “Support has been a big focus for the last while.”

Newell also noted that Valve, which uses Steam to help promote its own games like Dota and Counter Strike, is investing more heavily in its support infrastructure.

![Image 62: Screenshot of a presentation slide about a massive social network, featuring reviews and achievements from various users](https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steamvalve_0236-630x420.jpg)

Giardino touted the variety of business models for games on Steam, noting that “there are a ton of ways games are monetized on PC.” He also talked about Steam’s “massive” social network.

Part of Giardino’s session touched on how Valve is trying to make it easier for developers to get their games on Steam. That includes a new service called [Steam Direct](https://partner.steamgames.com/steamdirect)that debuted in June.

![Image 63: The slide titled Getting Started asks a series of questions, including if one just started development, just finished releasing on another platform, or somewhere in between, and then invites the audience to join whenever they are ready](https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steamvalve_0238-630x420.jpg)![Image 64: A slide titled Steam Direct - Process lists the steps to publish an app, including digital paperwork, a $100 per app recoupable fee, a brief app review, and releasing the app when ready](https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steamvalve_0240-630x420.jpg)![Image 65: A Steam Direct presentation slide with information on Steamworks and Steam Distribution](https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steamvalve_0239-630x420.jpg)![Image 66: A screen presents a presentation about Coming to PC from Mobile and lists Important things to consider such as Input, Resolution, Business Model, and User-Generated Content](https://cdn.geekwire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/steamvalve_0241-630x420.jpg)

Steam’s growth is noteworthy given [declining PC sales in the consumer market](https://www.geekwire.com/2017/as-windows-10-creators-update-hits-pc-market-analysts-debate-whether-glass-of-half-full-or-half-empty/), as many gamers shift toward mobile. However, the market for high-end PC gaming hardware [grew faster than expected last year](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/01/as-pc-sales-shrink-the-gaming-pc-market-grows-faster-than-expected/). Companies like Nvidia are also [coming out with cloud-based services](https://www.geekwire.com/2017/nvidia-unveils-cloud-service-turns-pc-powerful-gaming-machine/) that turn ordinary PCs into high-powered machines.

Valve, which is hosting [its annual massive Dota 2 tournament](http://www.dota2.com/international/overview/) in Seattle next week, got into the hardware business with its Steam Machines, [but didn’t see high demand](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/). Valve also developed[its own controllers](http://store.steampowered.com/sale/controllergames/) and [has partnered with HTC on virtual reality development](https://www.geekwire.com/2016/valve-ceo-gabe-newell-says-hes-spending-time-virtual-reality-technology/).
