Not every game will work at first, but a surprising number probably will. You can try it for yourself if you have a compatible device.

Steam on Chromebook [has entered beta](https://chromeos.dev/en/posts/steam-on-chromeos-beta) with the release of Chrome OS 108. Google also announced Steam support for Chromebooks with AMD Ryzen 5000 C-Series processors as well as 12th Gen Intel CPUs.

As with [Steam Deck](https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review), the program will make use of Valve’s [Proton l](https://www.protondb.com/)ayer to make more Windows games compatible. “Chrome OS will typically run the Linux version of a game if it exists,” according to Google’s Chromium blog — additional titles will run via Proton.

Chromebook owners interested in using Steam can find setup instructions on [Google’s Chromium blog](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/steam-on-chromeos/). For titles that leverage Proton, you’ll need to enable Steam Play, which can be done in the Steam client.

Some 20 Chromebook models have been confirmed to be compatible with the beta release, including Acer’s flagship [Spin 713](https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review) and [Spin 714](https://www.theverge.com/23426924/acer-chromebook-spin-714-2022-review), Asus’ standout [Chromebook Flip CX9](https://www.theverge.com/22776850/asus-chromebook-flip-cx5-review-the-15-inch-chromebook-to-beat), HP’s business-oriented [Dragonfly Chromebook](https://www.theverge.com/23341235/hp-elite-dragonfly-chromebook-2022-review), and the modular [Framework Laptop Chromebook Edition](https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/21/23363862/framework-laptop-chromebook-edition-laptop-design-specs-price-release). A number of big-name titles are supported, including _The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt_,_Portal 2_, _Hades_, _Disco Elysium_, _Return of the Obra Dinn, Fallout 4,_ and _Civilization V._
