The well-meaning earnestness and awesome gaminess of the [Humble Indie Bundle IV](http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/12/21/humble-indie-bundle-4-adds-five-more-games-soundtracks/) are being exploited by evil internet users who would probably sell their own grans to be in with a chance of winning the latest Steam competition.

According to the [Humble Indie Bundle blog](http://blog.humblebundle.com/post/14549340777/1-min-price-for-getting-steam-keys) , distinctly un-humble buyers are using the Steam codes from the Humble Indie Bundle to legitimise throwaway Steam accounts created specifically to enter Valve's current raffle. “It's a lose-lose situation for the indie developers, charities, Valve, and Humble Bundle,” says the blog.

To combat this, the minimum you'll have to spend in order to get Steam keys in your Bundle is $1, instead of 1 cent. If the Scrooges among you can't afford the $1 minimum you can contact the Humble Indie guys and they'll send you the Steam keys - if you promise not to resell them or otherwise abuse them.

The incessant, nauseating loop of Band Aid on the radio and tear-jerking ads for homeless dogs on the telly are there to remind us that Christmas isn't just about being drunk for a whole day, but that it's also about donating to charities and hard-up indie game developers. Let's just hope the Humble Indie guys don't lose faith in the goodness of humanity.
