Steam will soon fully support Macs equipped with Apple’s in-house chips. In the [latest Steam client beta](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545611272206420782) spotted [by _9to5Mac_](https://9to5mac.com/2025/06/12/steam-finally-goes-native-on-apple-silicon-heres-how-to-try-it/), Valve says the “Steam Client and Steam Helper apps now run natively on Apple Silicon.”

That means Steam will no longer need to use Rosetta 2 to run on Macs with M-series chips. [Rosetta 2 is the emulator](https://www.theverge.com/21304182/apple-arm-mac-rosetta-2-emulation-app-converter-explainer) that allows Intel-based apps to run on Apple Silicon’s ARM architecture. Native support for Apple Silicon should make Steam run more smoothly.

The update follows Apple’s announcement that it will stop [launching major updates for Intel-based](https://www.theverge.com/news/683846/macos-tahoe-intel-x86-arm-m-cpu) Macs after macOS Tahoe. The company [has also confirmed](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/about-the-rosetta-translation-environment) that Rosetta 2 will only be available through macOS 27. “Beyond this timeframe, we will keep a subset of Rosetta functionality aimed at supporting older unmaintained gaming titles, that rely on Intel-based frameworks,” Apple says.

You can [try out the Steam beta](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/276C-85A0-C531-AFA3) by opening the app on your Mac, selecting **Steam > Settings > Interface**. From there, look for the “Client Beta Participation” heading, and select **Steam Beta Update** from the dropdown menu. Steam will then prompt you to relaunch the app.
