At least two "major" shops will demand publishers remove Steam functionality from PC games, a new report claims.

If publishers refuse, those retailers will not sell PC games with Steam integration at all.

"Key retailers" fear Valve's digital service has a "monopoly" on the download market, according to [MCV](http://www.mcvuk.com/news/41746/Retail-threatens-Steam-ban).

Sources claimed Steam serves 80 per cent of the PC download sector, and shops are worried that selling games with Steam tech built-in pushes users towards only buying games through Valve.

"If we have a digital service, then I don't want to start selling a rival in-store," the digital boss at one of the biggest UK games retailers told MCV.

"Publishers are creating a monster – we are telling suppliers to stop using Steam in their games."

More than 30 million people have Steam accounts, according to Valve.
