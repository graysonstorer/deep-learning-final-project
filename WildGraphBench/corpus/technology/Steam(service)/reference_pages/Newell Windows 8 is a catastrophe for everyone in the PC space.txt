By Mike Jackson for [CVG UK](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/uk/)

Valve boss man Gabe Newell appears nervous of a closed-platform future for Windows, and calls Windows 8 "a catastrophe for everybody in the PC space".

[![Image 5: Windows 8 Screenshot](http://cdn.medialib.computerandvideogames.com/screens/screenshot_263793_thumb_wide300.jpg)](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/viewer.php?mode=article&id=263793) "Valve wouldn't exist if it weren't for the PC," he said, noting the crucial importance of "the openness of the platform".
He went on, "I think there's a strong temptation to close the platform. If people look at what they can accomplish when they can limit competitors' access to their platform, they say, "Wow, that's really exciting." Even some of the people who have open platforms, like Microsoft, get really excited by the idea that Netflix has to pay them rent in order to be on the Internet.

"I don't think that's a very attractive future," said Newell, adding, "Now we have to start finding ways that we can continue to make sure there are open platforms.

"We're trying to make sure that Linux thrives," says Newell, who reckons that the lack of games is what's holding back the alternative PC operating system. "So we're going to continue working with the Linux distribution guys, shipping Steam, shipping our games, and making it as easy as possible for anybody who's engaged with us - putting their games on Steam and getting those running on Linux, as well. It's a hedging strategy," he said.

Newell went on to express his concern for a possibly closed future for Windows with [the arrival of the new OS](http://www.computerandvideogames.com/358756/windows-8-release-date-confirmed-for-october/). "I think that Windows 8 is kind of a catastrophe for everybody in the PC space," he declared.

"I think that we're going to lose some of the top-tier PC [original equipment manufacturers]. They'll exit the market. I think margins are going to be destroyed for a bunch of people. If that's true, it's going to be a good idea to have alternatives to hedge against that eventuality."

The evil Micro$oft ( ![Image 18: :evil:](http://cdn.static.computerandvideogames.com/forums/images/smilies/icon_evil.gif) ) wants all software purchases made via the Windows 8 app store? Are they going to start making things difficult for a third-party platform like Steam and ultimately try to force it to move onto Linux? I have dozens of titles on my Steam account, so this Windows 8 hassle is something I'm slightly worried about.

I wouldn't worry. If it did come to that, there would be a huge backlash, and if Microsoft wouldn't erase their mistakes afterwards, then Steam would probably thrive on whatever platform it would migrate to if it was booted from Windows.

You are missing my point. MS have always worked with an open platform and part of their popularity over Apple was due to that. It DOESN'T balance anything out. It proves that consumers are perfectly happy to buy into a closed, proprietary platform. In fact, in order for MS to compete they have to consider going the same way. This is because in order to provide the same consistent quality of interface, software and experience they NEED to control every aspect of the hardware and interface. If this goes closed it is the consumers fault.

Windows is an "open" platform only because the U.S. justice department and the EU have forced it to be. In the '90s M$ tried to shut down all the competitors to Internet Explorer, like Netscape, until the authorities banned Microsoft's anti-competitive practices. I hope there's going to be a similar backlash, if M$ somehow tries to cripple Steam and Origin, in order to make the Windows 8 app store dominant.

Acer's boss said:

"While Microsoft's unveiling of two own-brand tablet PCs has surprised the supply chain in Taiwan and brought worries on PC vendors, Acer founder Stan Shih has commented that Microsoft has no real intention to sell own-brand tablet PCs and the offering is an ploy to boost adoption of Windows 8.

Microsoft hopes that marketing its own-brand tablet PCs will encourage vendors to offer Windows 8 tablet PCs and thereby help expand market demand for the product line, Shih analyzed. Once the purpose is realized, Microsoft will not offer more models, Shih said. Vendors adopting Windows 8 should interpret Microsoft's intentions positively, as they will benefit from Microsoft's marketing, Shih indicated.

Microsoft has no reason to sell hardware because such sales bring much less profit than licensing its software products, according to Shih. In addition, Microsoft will face many difficulties marketing tablet PCs on its own, including production management, distribution, and after-sales maintenance service, Shih indicated."

As for the hardware... they all buy their stuff from third parties, apart from Sony?

That was nothing to do with 'openness' that was to do with pushing products on it's users... not them vetting every product that runs on their system and controlling them completely. They were using anti-competitive practices, but they never completely locked down their OS the way that Apple have and the biggest issue was that they owned monopolies due to buying companies out and hostile business practices. That is an ENTIRELY different argument...

Which about allowing them the option to SET UP their system with a different browser. There was no limitation on downloading and using any browser that you wanted, from any site that you wanted... ever tried doing a similar thing on an iPhone? This wasn't about open'ness cos they never limited your options only pushed their software solution "too hard". This is about when you boot up windows it setting up Internet explorer automatically. That ISN'T and issue with how open they are 'cos there are no imposed limits on software installed from third parties. Apple, however, require all software to be vetted and do their best to limit downloads through their store. MS don't take a cut from Steam when you buy a game on them... I bet you Apple do

Well, yeah! But, my whole point is that this situation is a RESULT of Apple's business model doing so well and is a MASSIVE bad thing. I often argue with my Brother (who is an Apple fanboy) and he cites blue screen of death ALL the time as an anti-MS argument. I know for a fact the >80% of Blue screens on XP were due to 3rd party drivers. That doesn't happen on Mac simply cos it is a closed hardware and software platform. Everything sold on it (pretty much) is a revenue stream for Apple and gets vetted BY Apple. Take for example the current situation of Virus protection on osx and you see the problems

Why is a desktop OS being compared to a phone OS? I run OS X and I'm free to install whatever I want on it. I've got two browsers (Safari and Chrome) and run Steam which is not tied to the Mac or the App Store. There's also no way Apple can take a cut from my Steam purchases.

Not only that but as we all know its interface is based on the god damm awful "Metro" update which frankly speaks for itself. But the thing that annoyed me the most is that there is no start menu which I use all the time to access my games/programs, without it I am lost, and there is no way to make Windows 8 look like or perform like an older version of Windows (I have my Xp set to look and run like Windows 98 for example as I have always preferred the interface and its ease of use). Oh well, never mind, I'm sure the final release version will have adverts playing as your desktop wallpapaer so its not all bad.

Lo and behold, my computer recently decided it is illegal, and because the sticker with my license number is stuck to the base of my laptop, the numbers are slightly eroded. After a couple of attempts to type in what I thought was the correct code, Windows now refuses to let me do anything unless I call Microsoft. On finding I had written down the correct code previously in the DVD box for the upgrade software, I checked to see if I was eligible for free support and I now find the f**kers want me to pay £50 for the privilege of speaking to their call centre, or find someone at Samsung that will validate my Windows software. Like that would happen. It's legal you f**kers. I am not upgrading to Win8 simply because some inbuilt MS Malware has blacklisted me.

So it is Msofts fault that the Samsung laptop(which comes with an altered to suit Windows for samsung hardware) had its WAT screwed and it's Msofts fault that Samsung put the key info on a label that was on the bottom of the laptop so it would rub away when used on your lap? I think the blame should lie with Samsung, call them and give them the key you wrote down they should be your first point of contact as they sold you the licence with the upgrade feature.

Don't get me wrong Msoft are not whiter than white (nor is any big company) but this just seems to be Samsungs issues not MSofts.

> When visiting a friend recently I had the opportunity to try the Windows 8 beta on his Pc and my suspicions were confirmed - it was s***. They've changed so much of it around its unrecognizable. Not only that but as we all know its interface is based on the god damm awful "Metro" update which frankly speaks for itself. But the thing that annoyed me the most is that there is no start menu which I use all the time to access my games/programs, without it I am lost, and there is no way to make Windows 8 look like or perform like an older version of Windows (I have my Xp set to look and run like Windows 98 for example as I have always preferred the interface and its ease of use). Oh well, never mind, I'm sure the final release version will have adverts playing as your desktop wallpapaer so its not all bad.

Games and programmes from your start menu? What the hell man, are we back in the 90's?!

It's easy to find my games, 99% of them are on Steam. The other 1% are shortcuts on my desktop. If I had a lot of games that weren't on Steam I would make a folder on my desktop and keep all shortcuts in there. What the hell man?!

The system it self is crap, it's a Vista Patch #2, it took them 3 years to develop a tablet derivative UI and virtually no practical new features, only stupid people who are casual will use it, only kids, moms and grandpas who are used to mobile bulls**t.

I full expected this to happen, I was in no hurry to see or test it, I was predicting this long ago, and look, it even surprised me how crap it is today.

The OS is s**t, what's your problem, because it really isn't about the digital store, the OS is totally ruined unless the big guys tweak the heck out of it but I won't be participating because I'm not even sure if it's worth the time&effort because I may skip it totally. Win7 is great with a lot of tweaking (I have documented all of em and saved them for future quick installs ). Win8 doesn't feel nor look like a PC OS, let me quess how much effort and NERVES will someone use trying to modify default settings and make tweaks to make it work like Win7 (with XP theme&feel)

There is no technical barrier making metro on win7 or winxp or whatever, there is no technical barrier making, Microsoft is and was always making **ARTIFICIAL** BARRIERS, it's their thing to sell the new OS as that's the only thing they care about, and they need to do this when they have new OS every 3 stinking years. Microsoft doesn't care about game performance, advanced user usability and multi-tasking improvements, user experience, they only care about the casual "BOOT UP" time for those casual laptop noobs who can't wait a few more seconds for boot. Compared to Linux, Windows is a disaster, it's buggy, it's much less stable and it's simply badly implemented to the quality of Linux code.

Only sheep will use Win8, the brainless gamer kids who compete who has more polished Steam account, childish bs.

Typical steam traitors won't understand what gabe meant most of the time.

Why traitors, because usually steam-only people are mainstream consolized mobile noob kids who have no idea about tech and no idea about software and hardware work, you use PCs and try to talk BS and spread false information and stupid opinions you are TRAITORS to the PC community at large. You keep buying stuff that's crap, it's because of you EVERYTHING gets DUMBED DOWN even more. 

Just don't get Win8, and by the way, you need UEFI motherboard so it won't even work on these old mobos, you need a new PC or laptop, just DON'T get it, it won't make a difference, boot up will be a few seconds faster, that's ridicolous, you can have fast boot if you know how to tweak win7 and use SSD and it's 10 seconds FROM **SHUTDOWN** not from sleep!!!

Argh It's so annyong to come here expecing support for this GREAT MOMENT IN HISTORY that someone from gaming/tech finally realized how crappy Win8 is and I see a TON of stupid gamer kids not agreeing and having stupid opinions god this is so painful in this gaming industry, not surprise everything gets dumbed down if you are willing to CONSUME bs.

Why does everyone assume his opinion was about digital. What if his opinion is about the actual usability of the OS and technical advancement in the PC space.

Wow! Seriously, if it's not for you, don't upgrade. Why work yourself up if others like it and choose to do so? I initially thought it was crap, when they released the first preview, but installing it on my Mac via Parallels has made it my favorite OS. The track-pad on the Mac works like a dream with it, so I guess that helps.

I don't want to tweak it to make it work like Win 7, because I like Win 8 as it is. If I wanted it to be like Win 7, I'd stick with that.

I can publish a game today for any windows platform including Windows 8 at no cost, but if I want to make it available via Steam I have to pay Gabe some cash. An amount of cash that Valve doesn't make publically available.

If I want to make it available in the new windows 8 marketplace I know I have to give Microsoft a 30% cut. At least they're being open and up front about it.

Did you actually read my comment? Or just hit 'quote' and ranted on at a subject I didn't even touch upon. I don't care about the OS, if it isn't for you, don't use it, I'm more concerned with the money the developers get. If they don't get a decent slice because of MS also wanting a cut, we'll be seeing a deterioration in the quality and/or delivery of our games.

Ok, this is not a good way to get your point across, but I know what you are getting at.

The problem is most that most people are not PC gods and are not bothered / don't have the time to learn. I know that most people could have a better experience with their PC if they knew more about what they are using, but that's the way of the world.

Want a Metro Style UI but don't want Windows 8? Simple! Just instal a new UI for Windows 7. Here is an example:

[http://www.akascope.com/2011/09/16/inst ... windows-7/](http://www.akascope.com/2011/09/16/install-windows-8-metro-ui-windows-7/)

Want to cut PC boot times down? Simple! Type 'msconfig' in the run section of your start menu and you can tweak what program's open when the system boots up. You can turn most of them off and enjoy fast boots!

My advise dude, is instead of screaming from the hills about how s**t it all is. Try instead of sharing some of that 1337 knowledge and help your fellow PC user!

Fast boot i meant from shutdown to welcome screen. With a SSD, superfects and readyboot are unnecessary, there are also tweaks to optimize SSD performance and SATA3 setup is crucial (SATA3 ports, Sata3 Device, Sata3 Cable (blue))

And the most thing that adds to boot time is drivers, especially Graphics ones.

Steam also takes aways some customizability and flexibility, also make some mods incompatible due to slight difference in game code from the retail versions, Steam is also an annoyance when companies put it as requirement.

To combat steams stupid installation folder you can use HardLink Extension for Windows 7, select the root game folder in "common" where steam is, move that to wherever you want and right click on that game folder and select "pick link source" then go back to steam > "common" folder and right click and select "Drop As" > " junction"

Just look at this ... in one of those top thread someone already talked with microsoft redditors, and they really don't care about our opinion, they're risking it all getting golden from most less experienced consumers.

Exactly. I dont see how people are reaching the conclusions they have. It's utter nonsense. Windows 8 has an app store. Big deal. Gabe is just like anyone else and is doing his best to keep his system relevent. The ammount of comments under this story that are just plain wrong is incredible. "Windows 8 being vista #2 with metro tacked on" is probably the best.

I have Windows 8 on the laptop in the office with me now. As it happens people were talking like this when I had it running. They were saying "it's slower to do this now" or "it's much more difficult and irritating to do that now"...Then I demonstrated to them how it can be faster and easier, sure enough they all agreed that things had changed for the better. For instance some people were complaining how difficult it was to get somewhere like the device manager with all the metro "in the way", when in fact it takes literally one right click in the bottom left of the screen and everything a power user needs is there. It's now faster to access than it was before. People dont bother to find this kind of stuff out though cos theyre too busy being backwards philistines to embrace change or to accept that maybe MS has to move in this kind of direction or risk extinction.

You can do pretty much everything in Win7 as well

[http://www.door2windows.com/ultimate-wi ... p-vista-7/](http://www.door2windows.com/ultimate-windows-context-menu-customizer-customize-context-menu-in-windows-xp-vista-7/)

I have tons of tweak not just this one.

Here are some of the interesting comments taken on Reddit:

> We've already tested Windows 8 (consumer preview) across 3 independent small projects projects (CTO Team, help desk, and Server/Citrix). The unanimous decision is that we will not be upgrading to Windows 8. We will be supporting Windows 7 and skipping to Windows 9 (or whatever it ends up being called).
> 
> 
> We already support multiple office versions and expect that trend to continue with Office 15. Office 365 has been discussed but worries about data leakage (Healthcare) have pretty much stalled any testing.

> Metro is the reason. If it was Windows 7 with the various improvements made in Windows 8, but didn't have the Metro interface in the desktop version, we would be first in line to purchase it. For us the killer feature is Hyper-V on the client; we're a small dev shop, and running those VMs will be nice for when we need e.g. a server instance, SharePoint, etc. to work on.

> Fortune 100 company here. Absolutely everyone in IT is pushing against Windows 8, from the bottom all the way to the top. There will be a few instances where we will have to support if for some reason (i.e. VP got a new tablet, etc), but we are definitely not deploying it.
> 
> 
> The server side is a bit different. Even though Metro on a server is stupid beyond measure, we will be using Server 2012 - mostly for the advances in Hyper-V.

I am still missing the point as to why Steam is for console fanboys only (mods can be made to work in Steam many have and many more will be, there are also many ways to alter Steam paths/bypass the launcher etc.) As for Windows 8 not even looked at this yet, 7 is fine for what I want need (and where I work they have not even got 7) and seems pretty decent (few niggles but hey). I have not been hearing good things about 8 maybe it will be another Vista.

Because a true PC gamer likes to have PHYSICAL copies that mean something, the booklets and the case and all the collector stuff, you see developers in the industry having their collection in corner, WHAT THE HECK would you put in collection if you had all your games digital ? A bookcase full of papers with written on CD-KEYs ? ![Image 66: :shock:](http://cdn.static.computerandvideogames.com/forums/images/smilies/icon_eek.gif)

Digital copy has precisely ... zero historical value.

It's actually easier to buy a private company (if that is the case) since you don't have to disclose anything.

Microsoft and apple are really the same company except Apple is more likeable. Linux is a great OS but with Ubuntu's switch to unity I think it will still be slow to be adopted as that is the first version new users will go to. The best thing for the PC might be for big companies like Valve, Nvidia, AMD, and Intel to collaborate on a new linux Distro that is focused on gaming and comes with all their games and hardware.

Unfortunately most consumers in the US don't care as long as it is white and shiny simple as that, doesn't matter if it is way overpriced or is in someway restricted by apple so as not to be open to the consumer to customize their phone how they wish.

Linux... I tried that OS.. and I rather use a Mac. That system just sucks.. unless you VERY much into that stuff... the system is hardly supported by any drivers, is buggy as hell. The only ones keeping it alive is MS haters.

Thats more monetary value for a physical item, Historical value for the game would be the ability to play it in the future regardless of form and digital does do that so when the physical copies fail due to use/age the digital copy has the chance to live on in many forms so which would you say was the best for "Historical reasons"? As for boxes everywhere, yeah great when I lived alone or at my parents house now with a family its a bit hard to get space I still buy a few select titles retail but for me digital is a godsend.

Not only that but as we all know its interface is based on the god damm awful "Metro" update which frankly speaks for itself. But the thing that annoyed me the most is that there is no start menu which I use all the time to access my games/programs, without it I am lost, and there is no way to make Windows 8 look like or perform like an older version of Windows (I have my Xp set to look and run like Windows 98 for example as I have always preferred the interface and its ease of use). Oh well, never mind, I'm sure the final release version will have adverts playing as your desktop wallpapaer so its not all bad.

Yes, its the way I like to run my Pc. I don't use steam at all, I prefer my games boxed. The only reason I have it installed on my computer is because I was forced to install it to play Half-Life - a game I legitimately bought.

Good point. Hate it when it's used in relation to music, sport; anything actually. If you like somethign you like something and it's generally only the strange obssessive's that think there's levels of liking things

The industry is pretty serious about it's opinion ... I don't think you anyone of you can doubt my explanations, and no im not arguing besides, that "true pc gamer" thing went far into another topic.

I'm did not mean to you personally, nor I am talking to you directly , I speak generally mostly even tho i quote the relevant text, and everyone for him self can judge in which category he falls in, ofcourse I don't know what boxed copies who bought for everyone in this topic.

Funny thing is no-one knows what the f**k you are talking about as the conversation has gone from Steam is evil and the End of Days to Zynga being dissed by Iwata (Ninty has a digital distribution service, so you are now siding with a company that should be going by your posts banned/stopped for historical reasons). ![Image 93: :lol:](http://cdn.static.computerandvideogames.com/forums/images/smilies/icon_lol.gif)

Microsoft's various PowerPoint presentations repeat time and time again that Metro is an abstract concept rather than a thing, which is why they keep on saying "Metro style apps" rather than "Metro apps". A key part of this concept is an emphasis on polish, cleanness, and consistency as in they are actively telling people to spend more time on the design of their software, even down to considering touch areas on the screen in relation to the position of the user's hands.
> 
> 
> But: Microsoft's own Metro apps are poor. What they tell us time and time again is quite different to what they do themselves. I have watched countless MS engineers get quite confused with the Windows 8 apps, because they have no consistency. Some apps bring up their app bar at the bottom. Some bring it up at the top. Some app bars put context-sensitive nav on the left and global on the right. Some app bars mix the two. Other apps go off on their own, like OneNote's radial menu. Many apps (eg Mail) bring up traditional menus that have several items very close together, thus thwarting touch users.
> 
> 
> Microsoft's strong "encouragement" to keep the UI clean means that many actions are hidden by default. This does mean that the user is presented with fewer options on the screen, which is always nice, but it also means that users need to be retrained to bring up app bars when they can't find what they want. This is made a bit more confusing by the fact that these app bars can and do present contextual information, which means you might bring up the app bar and not see a button because you weren't on the correct screen / hadn't pre-selected the right item. This is somewhat mitigated by the fact that developers can force their app bar to appear when the user does something, but it still relies on developers to get it right.
> 
> 
> Switching in to and out of Metro isn't confusing, and it's really fast, so I don't think it will be a problem for users. Our test devices are all upgraded from Windows 7, and they haven't struggled in the slightest with any part of Windows 8. However, the fact that the switch exists is strange: Microsoft is very, very strongly pushing developers towards Metro (I can't emphasize this enough: we are basically being given no choice if we want any help from MS), and I would expect every developer to make the move to Metro quickly. The fact that the desktop remains - even for MS's own apps, like Visual Studio - makes the environment feel confused, particularly because it makes no attempt to be touch friendly. Microsoft has produced Office with both Metro and non-Metro UIs, which tells me their own teams haven't really bought into it.
> 
> 
> Microsoft seem very confused about screens. In one of the very earliest talks we had with Microsoft, the senior engineer who was present told us that all their research indicated users never work with more than one window at a time. They work in one app, Alt+Tab to work in another, then Alt+Tab to work in another, etc - always one at a time, full screen. Fine, we thought; on reflection, that is how we spend most of our time. But then MS throw a curveball: "users only want full-screen apps, so we're going to run your apps in full screen… Unless users drag you to the right to have you have as a second window. And you, being a triple-A app, need to support that." So, we're always full screen, except for the times we're not full screen. Worse, that right-hand docking area is 320px wide. Exactly. Even when the display is 2500xwhatever, that area is 320px wide. Neat! Even this sidebar is confused: Microsoft are telling us our app needs to re-layout when it's docked so the user can see critical information, but a) the Windows Store just shows the words "Store" when it's docked in the right, and b) Internet Explorer zooms out to show the whole length of its web page when docked, which means you can't actually read anything.

> The most annoying thing of all is WinRT. This is, for any developer, almost like starting from scratch. We had .NET 3.0 with Vista, which introduced WPF and lots of other replacements for Win32. But WinRT throws all that away and replaces it with something very similar, just named differently and working differently. But, it's not complete, so they've included a subset of .NET to plug the gaps until they are filled at some point in the future. WinRT is very nice, don't get me wrong, but several people at Microsoft have told me in hushed voices that it's more about the Windows team asserting dominance over the Visual Studio/.NET team than anything else. The "demo" Microsoft publicly gives about why .NET wasn't working for them is a straw man: "if you want to access the video camera in .NET, look how awful it is - you have to bind to the Windows APIs yourself! So rather than adding .NET APIs to do that binding for you - a day's work for a smart intern - we're going to toss it away and do everything from scratch." As a result, there are now two ways to do just about every core operation: the WinRT way, and the .NET way. (I should probably add: the fact that the Windows Runtime is known as Windows RT/WinRT is quite confusing given that the ARM port of Windows 8 is also called Windows RT)

> Microsoft has promised incredibly low pricing in order to make upgrading irresistable. This is helpful to us, largely because we're forced into the corner with Metro and WinRT and so can't easily make backwards-compatible code for Windows 7. But Windows Phone 8 is nowhere to be seen, and Windows Phone 7 isn't supported - d'oh.

Some support more advanced features like semantic zoom, others don't, and it's quite fun in the Microsoft demos to watch them hold down keys and scroll with their mouse wheel as they try to figure out which apps use it and which don't.

Windows 8 doesn't repeat the same mistakes as Vista; like I said, it's fast and stable. Instead, it makes its own all-new mistakes, not least the fact that it's so inconsistent: almost every Microsoft app looks and works differently, switching in and out of Metro shouldn't be necessary, hot corners will confuse stacks of people, and ultimately there are too many UI paradigms fighting for dominance that it can't help but feel like patchwork.

As it is, Metro feels like it's superglued on, with bits of .NET stapled to it for good measure. Windows 8 is fast and totally stable - as in, I haven't had a glitch with the release preview even once - but it's half-baked, inconsistent, and seems to solve all sorts of problems that never really existed in the first place.
