The PlayStation 3 version of Valve's upcoming first-person puzzler Portal 2 features cross-platform play and chat with the Steam PC and Mac versions.

It also boasts persistent cloud-based storage of game saves.

Additionally, the PS3 version unlocks the Steam Play version free of charge when gamers link their PlayStation Network and Steam accounts.

"We made a promise to gamers at E3 that Portal 2 for the PS3 would be the best console version of the product," said Valve boss Gabe Newell.

"Working together with Sony we have identified a set of features we believe are very compelling to gamers. We hope to expand upon the foundation being laid in Portal 2 with more Steam features and functionality in DLC and future content releases."

Portal 2 project lead Josh Weier added: "We designed the Portal 2 PS3 experience to be very straightforward for gamers.

"PS3 gamers will be able to simply drop the Blu-ray disc in the PS3, link to their Steam account from inside the game, and all their Steam friends (on PC and Mac) will be visible and accessible for chat and game invites."

[Christian Donlan went hands-on with Portal 2 for Eurogamer in June last year](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/portal-2-e3-2010-preview). "Not only has the developer managed to make Euclid-busting geometrical challenges seem breezy and moreish," he wrote, "it realises that the best puzzle games are the ones that are balanced so sweetly in terms of mechanics and difficulty that, ultimately, they make their players feel smart too."
