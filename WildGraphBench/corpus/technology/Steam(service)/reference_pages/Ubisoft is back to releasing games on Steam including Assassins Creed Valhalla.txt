# Ubisoft is back to releasing games on Steam, including Assassin's Creed Valhalla

Ubisoft is bringing [_Assassin’s Creed Valhalla_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208920/Assassins_Creed_Valhalla/), _Anno 1800,_ and _Roller Champions_ to Steam, arguably its first major releases on Valve’s PC distribution platform since 2019.

“We’re constantly evaluating how to bring our games to different audiences wherever they are, while providing a consistent player ecosystem through Ubisoft Connect,” reads part of a statement from Ubisoft spokesperson Jessica Roache to _The Verge_. Roache declined to say whether that means Ubisoft will now regularly bring games to Steam or if it’ll be on a case-by-case basis.

It’s not clear why Ubisoft stopped putting its PC games on Steam or why it’s coming back now, but it appears to be picking up where it left off: [_Valhalla_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/11/9/21554755/assassins-creed-valhalla-review-xbox-one-ps4-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc)was the 2020 flagship game in the _Assassin’s Creed_ series, with the next title, _Assassin’s Creed Mirage_, not due till 2023._Roller Champions_ came out this May. And _Anno 1800_ is actually coming back to Steam after previously having been removed — it’s from 2019.

But it’s no secret that Ubisoft pulled games from Steam to make them exclusive to the Epic Games Store instead, which [famously gave publishers millions](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22418782/epic-games-store-free-games-cost-apple-trial-arkham-subnautica-mutant-year-zero) to attract games to that rival platform. For example, the Steam store page for _Anno 1800_ currently still has this note: “Notice:Sales of Anno 1800 will be discontinued on Steam after April 16th due to a publisher decision to make the game exclusive to another PC store.”

[Epic paid $146 million](https://twitter.com/simoncarless/status/1389372260067123200/photo/1) to make 2K Games’ _Borderlands 3_ exclusive to that platform, and [documents from the _Epic Games v. Apple_ trial](https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/21043983-2019-october-epic-details-egs-free-game-how-well-aggressive-vs-wind-down-exclusives-strategy/#document/p12) show that Ubisoft’s _Watch Dogs: Legion_ was targeted as a must-have EGS exclusive at the time it was handing out that kind of money. [Lists of Epic Games Store exclusive titles](https://www.gamewatcher.com/news/Epic-games-store-exclusives) generally include a lot of big Ubisoft games.

Roache says that Ubisoft “never stopped our relationship with Valve,” though, and it’s true that Ubisoft continued to release some DLC after its main games largely stopped appearing on Steam as well as letting gamers play Steam titles they already own — despite [one brief scare this July](https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/11/23203791/ubisoft-steam-pc-games-accessible) when players noticed a poorly written message about how their titles would “not be accessible.”

Ubisoft also removed other games from Steam at that time, including [_Anno 2070_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/48240/Anno_2070/), [_Assassin’s Creed Liberation HD_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/260210/Assassins_Creed_Liberation_HD/), [_Silent Hunter 5: Battle of the Atlantic_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/48110/Silent_Hunter_5_Battle_of_the_Atlantic/), and [_Space Junkies_](https://store.steampowered.com/app/647590/Space_Junkies/) — but all of those save _Space Junkies_ appear to be on sale now. Roache says that some of these games were temporarily removed because their online multiplayer services were being decommissioned, and _Space Junkies_ is permanently gone because it was a multiplayer-only title.

Ubisoft says it doesn’t have any updates on whether it’ll be working with Valve on verifying these games for the Steam Deck.

_Assassin’s Creed Valhalla_ will [arrive on Steam on December 6th](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208920/Assassins_Creed_Valhalla/).

_**Update, 4:17PM ET:**Added context about why Space Junkies was permanently removed from Steam, and why some other Ubisoft games temporarily disappeared._
