Valve CEO Gabe Newell has been ordered to attend an in-person deposition regarding an antitrust lawsuit filed by Wolfire Games.

In an [order](https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/washington/wawdce/2:2021cv00563/298754/170/0.pdf) filed on November 16 in the US District Court for the Western District of Washington, Wolfire Games said Newell "is uniquely positioned to testify on all aspects of [Valve's] business strategy" and that an in-person deposition "would allow [it] to adequately assess Newell's credibility."

Newell had asked for a remote deposition due to concerns regarding COVID. However, the court said Newell has presented "insubstantial evidence to suggest that he is at particularised risk of serious illness" and, as a result, has been ordered to attend the deposition in person.

The order states that all participants have to wear masks during the deposition, and that Newell must remove his mask when answering questions.

Wolfire Games [filed an antitrust lawsuit against Valve in April 2021](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/wolfire-games-files-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve) for anti-competitive practices on Steam.

The filing centred around the 30% cut that the platform holder takes, with the developer arguing that Valve used "dominance to take an extraordinarily high cut from nearly every sale that passes through its store" and that it has used its position to "exploit publishers and consumers."

The [claim was initially dismissed in November 2021](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/judge-dismisses-wolfires-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve), with a US District judge arguing that the complaint did "not articulate sufficient facts to plausibly allege an antitrust injury based on that market."

The document concluded that Wolfire Games could file another complaint addressing the highlighted issues, which it did in May 2022, as reported by [Game Developer](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/blogs/steam-s-u-s-antitrust-lawsuits-fail-to-get-dismissed---now-what-).

Almost a third of German games companies expect 2026 to be a better year for the industry than 2025.

That's according to research published by the country's video games trade body, Game, which shows that 29% of respondents expect the games industry to head in a positive direction over the next 12 months. That's considerably higher than the 17% who voted this way in last year's poll.

41% of German games firms are neutral on whether 2026 will be better or worse, while 31% have a negative outlook on the coming 12 months.

When it comes to how they feel their own businesses will perform, 53% say that they are positive about 2026, representing a modest increase on last year's stats. 34% are neutral, while 12% feel the coming year will be worse.

Game also asked companies how they felt about hiring new staff in 2026; 32% said they were positive, the same as last year, but still a sizeable decline from the 41% who voted in the affirmative in 2024. 53% are neutral on the matter, a 2% increase year-on-year, while 15% feel negatively about hiring new employees, a 2% dip.

"Confidence is returning to Germany’s games industry," said the MD of Game, Felix Falk.

"Following a difficult phase both here and abroad, positive signals, such as the strong Gamescom 2025, and important policy initiatives, like the increased federal games funding and the announced federal tax incentives, are bringing improved prospects and greater optimism compared to a year ago."

During 2024, [the German games market decreased by 6% year-on-year](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/german-games-market-drops-6-to-94bn-in-2024), bringing in €9.4 billion. Premium game sales declined by 17%, too.

In July of this year, [Game also published research showing that the number of companies in the sector fell by 4% in 2024](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/number-of-german-game-companies-falls-4-in-last-year-after-years-of-growth), while the industry saw a 2% decline in workers.
