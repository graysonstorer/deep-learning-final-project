Every year during some of the hottest months of the year, [Steam](https://web.archive.org/web/20220702060016/https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/5/21282038/steam-game-festival-summer-delayed-valve) breaks out the discounts for its annual [Summer Sale](https://web.archive.org/web/20220702060016/https://store.steampowered.com/). This time around the Steam Summer Sale begins on June 25 and as usual, it will offer reduced prices on some of the biggest PC games around.

This year’s Summer Sale comes with the new addition of a permanent Points Shop. The shop will sell dozens of souvenir items for players to collect, like animated stickers, chat effects, profile backgrounds, avatars, and more. There will even be several items directly related to certain games. To collect these new items, players will have to spend points, which they’ll earn with each purchase they make on Steam.

Of course, that isn’t all that’s coming with this year’s Summer Sale. There are also new animated stickers to collect during the summer road trip, which will stop at new destinations — letting players collect new stickers — every few days.

The sale includes games like [_Borderlands 3_ for 50% off](https://web.archive.org/web/20220702060016/https://store.steampowered.com/app/397540/Borderlands_3/), bringing it down to $29.99, [70% off _Middle-Earth Shadow of War_](https://web.archive.org/web/20220702060016/https://store.steampowered.com/app/356190/Middleearth_Shadow_of_War/) making it $14.99, and [66% off _Total War: Warhammer 2_](https://web.archive.org/web/20220702060016/https://store.steampowered.com/app/594570/Total_War_WARHAMMER_II/) at $20.39.

Along with the discounted prices that will come along with the sale, Steam is also offering players an additional deal. Players will save $5 for every $30 they spend — or equivalent in their country.

The 2020 Steam Summer Sale will run from June 25 until July 9.
