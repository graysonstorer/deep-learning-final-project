COLLECTED BY

 Organization: [Archive Team](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam)

![Image 3: The image shows an archive team going to rescue your shit, and contains two plastic crates filled with old CD-ROMs, as well as a cabinet of old-fashioned cassette tapes](http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg) Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history. 
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at [archiveteam.org](http://www.archiveteam.org/) and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php), providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

**The Archive Team Panic Downloads** are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

Collection: [ArchiveBot: The Archive Team Crowdsourced Crawler](https://archive.org/details/archivebot)

 ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites). 
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.

There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at [http://www.archivebot.com](http://www.archivebot.com/).

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at [https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot](https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot).

#### Tax cut for the rich —

Valve changes developer terms to try to retain top games
========================================================

Steam devs now keep more of a game's revenues starting at $10 million in sales.

For years, game distribution platforms like Steam, GOG, Apple's App Store, and major game consoles have generally taken a 30 percent cut of any revenue made from online game sales. Now, Valve is moving to change those terms to be more generous to Steam developers, but only for the absolute biggest games on the service.

In [an announcement posted late Friday](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722180402/https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/1697191267930157838), Valve said that it would lower its usual 30 percent take to 25 percent for any game's earnings beyond $10 million (including "game packages, DLC, in-game sales, and Community Marketplace game fees"). The platform fee reduces further to 20 percent for earnings that surpass $50 million.

"The value of a large network like Steam has many benefits that are contributed to and shared by all the participants," Valve writes in the announcement. "It’s always been apparent that successful games and their large audiences have a material impact on those network effects so making sure Steam recognizes and continues to be an attractive platform for those games is an important goal for all participants in the network."

[Steam sees surprising, significant usage dip in 2018](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722180402/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/is-fortnite-to-blame-for-steams-falling-user-numbers-this-year/)

Valve's move comes during a time when an increasing number of PC games are finding success outside of Steam's market-leading platform. _Fortnite_ has managed to attract tens of millions of PC players without being available on Steam, for instance. That fact is arguably to blame for [a small dip in Steam's daily usage](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722180402/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/is-fortnite-to-blame-for-steams-falling-user-numbers-this-year/) earlier this year, as Steam-based competitor _PUBG_ dwindled in popularity. _Fortnite_ also decided to [opt out of Google Play](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722180402/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/08/fortnite-on-android-may-drive-its-battle-bus-past-googles-30-cut/) and its 30 percent cut for an Android release in September, yet the game still managed to [attract 15 million downloads in three weeks](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722180402/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/fortnite-reaches-15-million-android-downloads-without-google-play/) on the platform.

Other big-name PC game makers are increasingly trying to get around Valve's stranglehold on the market as well. This year's _Call of Duty: Black Ops 4_ was the series' first entry in years to skip Steam, opting for PC distribution [exclusively on Activision Blizzard's Battle.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722180402/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/black-ops-4-ditches-single-player-campaign-adds-battle-royale-mode/) instead. Electronic Arts [has largely eschewed Steam since 2011](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722180402/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/battlefield-3-not-coming-to-steam-ea-provides-good-reason/) in favor of its own Origin platform and [its associated Origin Access subscription program](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722180402/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/ea-launches-5month-subscription-plan-to-access-vault-games/). And CD Projekt's GOG.com has helped the company grow to [quarterly profits of nearly $18 million](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722180402/https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/investors/financial-summary-report/) in the most recent reporting period. 
While Valve's move might help convince some bigger developers to stick with Steam, many smaller developers are feeling rubbed the wrong way by the new blockbuster-focused tiered revenue structure. _Wandersong_ developer Greg Lobanov [tweeted](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722180402/https://twitter.com/theBanov/status/1068691994346573825) that the move was a way for "the richest [to] get richer. What a slap in the face to the rest of us... shouldn't it be the exact opposite?" Independent developer [Andriaan De Jongh](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722180402/https://adriaandejongh.nl/) added [via tweet](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722180402/https://twitter.com/AdriaandeJongh/status/1068791747067621381) that the move was "unfair to the 'other' 99 percent of developers. This is a good moment for everyone who doesn't earn that kind of money to talk to Valve."

Vlambeer developer Rami Ismail went so far as to paraphrase Valve's position [in a tweet](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722180402/https://twitter.com/tha_rami/status/1068708587118112768) as "don't worry, big game productions, we'll happily subsidize your increased income with the broken dreams of aspiring devs that fell just short of making it because they have no leverage and we don't care. Just please don't launch your own store."

Valve's move comes after Epic [lowered its revenue cut](https://web.archive.org/web/20220722180402/https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/07/epic-ups-unreal-marketplace-creators-pay-well-above-industry-standard/) from sales of development assets posted in the Unreal Marketplace in July, from 30 percent to 12 percent.
