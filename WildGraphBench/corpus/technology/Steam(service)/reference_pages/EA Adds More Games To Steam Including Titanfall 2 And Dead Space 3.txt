More Electronic Arts titles have popped up on Steam today, joining a bunch of games the publisher has recently released on Valve's digital storefront. [The Sims 4](https://www.gamespot.com/the-sims-4/) and all its expansion content, [Dead Space 3](https://www.gamespot.com/dead-space-3/), [A Way Out](https://www.gamespot.com/a-way-out/), and [Titanfall 2](https://www.gamespot.com/titanfall-2/) are new to the PC platform, following a host of games that have popped up on Steam recently.

The releases come just ahead of [EA Play 2020](https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-play-live-2020-when-and-how-to-watch-todays-dig/1100-6476783/), the virtual version of the publisher's yearly E3 fan event that takes place later today. Not all of the publisher's games are available on Steam just yet, as [Apex Legends](https://www.gamespot.com/apex-legends/), for instance, remains Origin-only on PC.

_Now Playing:_ Why Titanfall 2's Post-Release Content Is Praiseworthy

To mark the release of the new games, they're all on sale, as is their DLC (of which there is a _ton_ for Sims 4). These range from 30% to 75% off.

*   Dead Space 3 -- $10 (normally $20)
*   The Sims 4 -- $20 (normally $40)
*   Titanfall 2 -- $9.89 (normally $30)
*   A Way Out -- $15 (normally $30)

Previously, almost all of EA's games on PC were only available on its Origin digital distribution platform. That's changed recently, though, with a number of big, notable releases hitting Steam as well. Just this month, Star Wars Battlefront 2, Dragon Age: Inquisition, Mirror's Edge: Catalyst, Battlefield 5, Need For Speed: Heat, and Mass Effect 3 have made the transition from Origin to Steam. They follow EA's big hit from last year, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which hit Steam when it was released in November.

In addition to Steam and Switch, it also seems EA starting to increase its support for virtual reality platforms. The newly announced Star Wars: Squadrons will be playable in VR from front to back, joining the previously announced Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond.
