 Jon Fingas / Engadget 

In an unsurprising turn of events, [Valve has announced](https://steamcommunity.com/games/250820/announcements/detail/2216278054495230718) that it is ending SteamVR support for macOS. Spotted by [_Apple Insider_](https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/05/01/valve-abandons-the-macos-version-of-steamvr), the company made a terse announcement on its website, stating that "SteamVR has ended [macOS] support so our team can focus on Windows and Linux." Legacy builds will remain available, though, so tinkerers can still code VR experiences that run on Apple hardware. SteamVR first came to Apple’s operating system with the 2017 launch of macOS High Sierra. The OS enabled the use of an [external GPU](https://www.engadget.com/2018-07-18-apple-macbook-egpu-gpu-creative.html) (eGPU) over Thunderbolt 3, which could provide the additional processing power needed to run high-end VR applications. Valve didn’t provide explicit reasons for cancelling support, but gaming hasn’t been the Mac’s strong suit for decades, so lack of interest on the part of developers and users could have been a contributor.

There were several signs that the end was nigh. Valve’s own VR headset, the [Index](https://www.engadget.com/2019-06-28-valve-index-review-vr.html), does not support macOS, and Apple even [removed photos](https://twitter.com/oskargroth/status/1135485427270504449) featuring VR gadgets from its website, as just a few examples. Meanwhile, [rumors persist](https://www.macrumors.com/roundup/apple-glasses/) that Apple is developing its own VR and AR glasses. The future of VR on macOS isn’t clear. Apple could turn things around with its own headset, though there’s no guarantee that the company’s AR/VR projects will [come to fruition](https://www.engadget.com/2019-11-11-apple-ar-headset-2022.html).

[Scientists confirm the basis of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity Saul_Goodman 10 Jun Like many of Einstein's predictions, the equivalence principle was confirmed a long time ago. The only question is to what degree is this principle satisfied? How far can you go? Is it satisfied to 1 part in a million? 1 part in a billion? Is it satisfied in the strong gravity regime? Einstein used the equivalence principle as the basis for his GENERAL theory of relativity, which he made because Newton's theory of gravity was not compatible with his SPECIAL theory of relativity. The only other known force at the time was electromagnetism, which automatically satisfied Special Relativity.](https://www.engadget.com/equivalence-principle-confirmation-174018796.html?utm_source=spotim&utm_medium=spotim_recirculation)

[Denon rolls out the first 8K-ready receivers with its 2020 X-Series chodaboy19 6h I would prefer simpler models that can utilize eARC as the core feature. There is no real need to process the video with expensive chips, it's going to add complexity and lag no matter what. It's simpler to connect most devices to the TV, then use eARC to connect the TV to the receiver and let the receiver just decode the audio.This way the receiver won't be outdated when we get new video standards/features.
