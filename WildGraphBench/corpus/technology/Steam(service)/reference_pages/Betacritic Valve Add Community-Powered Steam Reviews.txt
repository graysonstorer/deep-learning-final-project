Everyone’s a critic. No seriously, pretty much everyone is inherently critical of at least a few things. Now, very, very, very few people are actually _good_ critics, but that’s an entirely different discussion for another time. Point is, user review systems are now built into everything from Amazon to the walls of most public bathrooms (kinda), so [Steam is following suit](http://store.steampowered.com/reviews/). Soon, you’ll be able to write your own game reviews, vote on other users’ all-caps bellowed missives, and follow along with folks whose tastes sync up with yours. The system is now in beta. More below, though after having written this post for only a couple minutes, I’m already prepared to declare it the worst of all time NEGATIVE THIRTY SEVEN BANANA APPLESAUCE OUT OF TEN.

On the upside, Steam’s user reviews don’t come with arbitrary scores, opting instead for a simple thumbs up/down approach. Also, users can’t review games they haven’t at least _in some way_ used in conjunction with Steam. This doesn’t necessarily mean you need to have purchased a game through Steam, but if it’s never been on your list – whether via an activation, Steam key, free weekend, or family share – then no dice.

Beyond that, it’s a fairly standard setup. You can vote your favorite reviews to the top of their respective games’ pages, track authors, and report reviews that you deem to be spammy or abusive. If developers choose to dive into the crowded critical morass and respond, their comments will be highlighted accordingly. Metacritic scores, meanwhile, aren’t being replaced. Rather, user review data will be displayed alongside them.

Now, I do see some potential problems issues here. People are quite fond of using report systems to shut down opinions that aren’t necessarily spammy or mean-spirited, but instead are simply opposed to their own. Valve’s gonna have to do a lot of up-close-and-personal monitoring and communication to keep this system in check, and that’s, er, never really been their thing, to put it lightly. Good user reviews are a handy additional resource, but poorly moderated communities just treat them as a new source of fuel for their flame wars. It’s tricky to maintain a balance between those two ends of the spectrum.

Best of luck to Valve on that, but even though the system’s only in beta right now, I’m already prepared to give it SEVENTEEN SEVERED APE THUMBS DOWN OUT OF THAT ONE SUPER UNDERRATED SCENE FROM THE NEW THOR MOVIE (YOU KNOW THE ONE).

Unfortunately there’s an arbitrary limit on how long each review can be.

I hate character limits. I had this very long and deep analysis of what Kingdom of Amalur was and was not, that I posted as a response to a guy asking “should I buy it?” in the comment section of this site, well it never showed up. So I took a deep breath and wrote it again from scratch. Again, nothing showed up. I did this three times. You can imagine my frustration. Later I found out that any comment with too many new lines are automatically classified as spam and never shown, without any warning of it happening. It’s a weird measure, because when my mother-in-law working from home decides to post how much she earns from home she doesn’t seem to have any trouble.

I actually use the “Lazarus” add-on for firefox, which autosaves the text you input in (almost) every web site every so often, and lets you recover it at any time. Really useful for avoiding frustrations like that

While the addon is probably best, in a pinch just get in the habit of crtl a, l c before you submit anything of length that you care about. If it all goes to hell you can still get a text editor open and save what’s in the buffer.

I do the same – If I am in the midst of writing an ESPECIALLY brilliant long post, I have a habit of copypasting it to notepad just in case. Never know when a site decides to eat it.

I always, ALWAYS disregard user reviews. Why? Because most people are idiots. Some of the user scores on Metacritic are ridiculous. I think Dragon Age 2 has about an 8.5 from critics and then for the user score it just has a picture of an old lady with visible piles, crying.

You know, you can also read something without swallowing it entirely as truth. You shouldn’t read reviews to find out what is “GOOD” or “BAD”. You should read them to find out, before spending money on it, that Brutal Legend is actually strategy game, or that Final Fantasy XIII has a new and entirely different combat system.

Before buying something on Amazon or Newegg, I always look at the 1-star reviews to get an idea of the thing’s weaknesses. If it has a tendency to spontaneously combust, that’s a problem. If it doesn’t work as advertised for a specific use case that is not mine, I’m okay with that.

Honestly I agree in that I still find critics reviews more believable than User ones. Simply not only the majority of players are simply ignorant enough to make a proper review, the can’t distinguish a game from a genre they don’t like from a bad game and they are way to prone to let their personal hates influence their reviews.

Paying attention to one review at a time is stupid, anyway. Any sane person will look at the global average user score, and judge from that. And if the review aggregate site is smart enough, they will implement median score averaging, not mean. This will weed out the outliers (such as 10/10 or 0/10).

As much as I hate metacritic (and the periodic score raids on some particular games), the median user score on most of them pretty accurately reflects on the average user thoughts about that game. I mean, take a look at the score disparity in Dragon Age 2 (which is a trite topic nowadays, but still properly illustrating the issue of only relying on “professional” reviews).

While it’s far from a perfect system, I do see value in that disparity.

For how long had gamers been bitching about inflated scores, paid reviews, and pussyfoot critiques? How many games were getting 7+ or equivalent reviews from supposedly discerning “professionals”? Maybe it’s different now, but I recall a period where everybody was sick of it. We were tired of buying titles on the strengths of the reviews only to find out that they fell short of their promise, broke down later in the game, or were just thoroughly average. I see the DA2 debacle as a response that was long in the making. It served as a very effective counterpoint to the soft reviews that glossed over or refused to acknowledge that game’s shortcomings. It’s like people were done swallowinging all the bullshit about how THIS GAME IS SO AWESOME RITE that permeated every developer’s and outlet’s commentary. Now, are those rock-bottom user reviews accurate? No. DA2 is not a terrible game, just somewhat disappointing IMO. But it certainly got the point across.

Basically, I generally don’t trust most “pro” reviewers, and I have little faith in the critical abilities of most user reviews. But when I see scores like that, it alerts to potential problems with the game (or in some cases informs me of some kind of wicked DRM system that I’d been unaware of). It tells me that a game might require further investigation before I throw fifty-sixty dollars down on it.

The strawman-ish paranoia of ‘report system as censorship’ doesn’t even register with me when compared with the actual abusiveness of existing ‘reviews’. See: [link to steamcommunity.com](http://steamcommunity.com//id/Mousti/recommended/232430/), and [link to steamcommunity.com](http://steamcommunity.com//id/dorroile/recommended/219680/) for the vitriol directed towards Gone Home and Proteus respectively.

The success of community powered Steam reviews will depend on how well moderated they are. Sadly, as things stand now this feature seems only to more easily facilitate deliberate antagonism and trolling. If Valve have any interest in fostering a genuinely useful community publishing and sharing tool for game critique, they have got to actually give a damn about what gets published. A lot of their recent developments seem like they create tools without figuring out a clear design, then letting the community deal with all the problems that arise i.e. Greenlight. And that’s ignoring the obvious money grabbing stuff like trading cards and the steam marketplace.

Hopefully Steam reviews doesn’t become a cesspool of trolling like many other places. Meanwhile i’ll stick with sites and people whose opinions I respect and am interested in for my reading material.

Also, it would be impossible to moderate the reviews, the Steam userbase is way too big. But having a policy of letting the users speak is better than not having it, even unmoderated. I am surprised they even manage to keep the Steam Workshop entries from being contaminated by porn, gore and various shock material.

The perhaps unintended benefit of al this is, because steam makes a surprisingly large amount of your gaming information available to casual browsing, you can go and find out what games the writer of the review really loves. And not even what they say they love, but the times dates and completion level of every game they own on steam. Interesting reading a lot of it.

For example, the chap from the Proteus review has recently become obsessed with a game called Bad Rats.

Actually it occurs to me that this kind of data would be interesting to include for all critics.

You’ll notice that those reviews have an 11% and 15% “helpfulness” rating, respectively. It sounds like they’re a perfect example of the system working as intended. Anyone can post their opinions, and then extreme or unhelpful opinions get rated down, while still being available for people who might actually find them useful. No need to moderate anything (except perhaps language – “shitdildos”? Really?) How would Valve even go about moderating opinions? Removing “excessively” negative or positive reviews?

Honestly, it sounds like a great system. You can read anyone’s opinion if you so desire, see what other thought of that opinion, and potentially find other users with similar tastes (or at least thoughtful reviews). You’ll likely need to intentionally go out of your way to get involved in a review flame war. Seriously, just mark offending reviews as “unhelpful” and move on (or report them if they are actually vile, rather than just a bad review).

Marking them and reporting them is exactly what I have done. I’m not sure why people keep bringing up ‘moderating opinions’. The above two reviews are used to illustrate intentional abusiveness and the shortcomings of the moderation system, not as examples of ‘opinions I disagree with’.

I’m fine with users meta-critiquing reviews as un/helpful, but Valve chose to allow ‘recommendations’ to become public reviews. It is entirely their responsibility to follow through with moderation, not a user’s responsibility to ignore abusive material.

Steam has a report system for many things, greenlight, the workshop, forums, profiles, and now reviews. If this system is to ‘work as intended’, that means moderation. It may be difficult to enforce, but they have stated a commitment to it in their FAQ. Hopefully they follow through with it.

I actually feel this could be a great feature. I have really wanted something along these lines for a while. I often see things on steam and think – “I wish I had some quick indication of what this game is like” – much like amazon reviews I think this will be a handy way of quickly gauging an approximation of the game – not necessarily whether it is good or bad (because god knows I freaking LOVE Rome 2 for example, which appears to be the most hated game ever) but just what it’s like in general. filtering out the personal rage/adoration is something of a reflex

I like it. Individual developers have god-mode enabled for their sections of the Steam forums, so people being able to post Amazon-style user reviews is an upgrade. The biggest selling point, for me, is that Steam will only let you review something it knows you’ve played.

Not exactly. I think you can just own it for Steam to allow you to write a review. And with bloated backlogs, you get no assurance that the reviewer played the game.

And eve if the stats say they didn’t, they could have always played a pirated copy first anyway.

Besides the “Most people are idiots” problem that has already been pointed out twice (thankfully, RPS exists, and there’s very few games that aren’t covered here that interest me), I’m afraid the only reviews that are going to get visibility are the ones supported by some steam friends “kickstarting” them with some upvotes.

It really depends on the community, after all. Most top-rated reviews on GOG are reasonable and well-written at least. But GOG is a safe and happy haven compared to Steam’s popularity, which is sure to attract hordes of opinionated trolls and 10-year-old flamers who don’t know the difference between your and you’re. Check the steam forums for confirmation.

(Not to mention, I set my reviews to public yesterday, but then on the store page it still tells me that they’re friends-only)

GOG’s review mechanism is badly broken, unfortunately.

They instigated an absurdly small character limit (used to be bigger than it is now), but they _don’t tell you what that is_. They tell you if the review you’re trying to submit is too long, but they don’t tell you _how much_ shorter it needs to be. The message that tells you this also has a winking smiley in it, because apparently they find it funny to make you rage in helpless frustration — which you do because you know that _you can’t edit your review once it is accepted_.

This means that every single attempt you make at reducing the character count to some _unknown_ acceptable amount must be edited into a coherent review before you click submit!

You cannot imagine quite how painful this is until you experience it. Anyone who actually tries to submit a good review is bound to fall foul of this idiotic system, and be so frustrated that they never submit another review again.

It’s about damn time Valve implemented a proper Recommend system. Up until this point, I was always afraid that we’d never see one because of Valve’s overriding concern for their profit margin.

Of course it’s going to be abused to an extent, but if you’re one of those people who can’t separate the honest reviews from the troll reviews, maybe you shouldn’t be reading them in the first place. Anyway, limiting it to game owners and Thumbs Up/Thumbs Down will prevent the worst offenders from spoiling the soup.

I already have these features and didn’t opt into any beta….weird.

Anyhow, I think this is great. I steam review almost every single game I complete on steam, so I already have a ton of reviews written there. Writing them was mostly for my own benefit (I tend to forget stuff after a few months if I don’t write down my thoughts about it immediately after experiencing it…..I keep a personal movie journal as well), but it kind of sucked that only my 40 some steam friends ever got to see them. Not that this means that hundreds of people will be reading my reviews now (given how huge steam’s userbase is, I suspect everything will just get lost in the deluge), but it’s still slightly better than what they had before.

Metacritic is too open to smear campaigns by people who haven’t actually played the game but heard bad things about it/dislike its genre, etc. Mass Effect 3 was a pretty good example, as it the aforementioned Dragon Age 2. Odd that Bioware generates this sort of thing (more likely it’s perceived as to do with EA’s influence, but that’s another thread).

Gamersgate has mandatory ownership as a pre-req for reviews, and it’s a decent system. You can usually quite quickly get a feel for whether you’d be interested in a game based on a handful of reviews.

Overall I think this system will do ok, considering the inherent limitations of allowing People on the Internet(r) to express opinions openly.

Whenever I look at GOG reviews they always seem to be 4.5 or 5 stars, never anything below. I’m sure that’s not entirely true, but that’s my experience.

I think this may be because you can write a review without actually owning the game on GOG. WHich means (by the nature of the site) many people may be writing reviews from their memories of playing the game 10 or more years ago – which isn’t actually a very good review for playing it for the first time now. And also doesn’t take into account any problems in the GOGified version.

The average rating or the individual reviews? The averages are pointlessly high. an average below 4 is very rare. However I find that you can usually find a negative review at least within the first 2-3 pages that has intelligent things to say.

You’re quite right – its the average ratings I’m thinking of – now I recall there are often the odd low-ish score.
