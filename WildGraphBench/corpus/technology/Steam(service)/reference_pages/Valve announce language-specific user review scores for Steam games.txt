Valve have carefully tweaked the user review system for Steam games, to now include language-specific user review scores.

This new system is on by default for all Steam users, however Valve said they realise changes will bring scrutiny and so there is a [dedicated setting](https://store.steampowered.com/account/preferences/#review_score_preferences) to disable it. If you do disable it, your Steam account will go back to seeing the overall review score from _all_ languages posting Steam reviews.

Why have they done this? As Valve explained, they've grown a lot into having a massive global presence from users from all difference regions. Some games may have translation issues, specific cultural references and so on. Valve feel this language-based review score will help to capture these issues and that "Calculating a language-specific review score means that we can better distil the sentiment of these different groups of customers, and in doing so, better serve potential customers that belong to those groups".

Keeping it all rather transparent, there's a whole new language breakdown section for Steam reviews you can click to open. At the top of the reviews section is this now:

![Image 8: The Steam customer reviews data for Stardew Valley shows overwhelmingly positive reviews, with a total of 786,466 reviews in all languages and 360,169 reviews in English, also overwhelmingly positive; further breakdown and preferences are available](https://uploads.golmedia.net/uploads/articles/article_media/3636359071755538170gol1.jpg)

And when you open the language breakdown you'll get to see the overall score as well:

 when we think steam is feature complete, they find another way to inovate, and in this case, this sound like an obvious feature to add, im surprised no one thought of that before.

 In the settings, I see:

> 
> * Include reviews from all Steam purchases

 No option to "include all languages, exclude off-topic"?

 I think I'd usually be not interested in the language specific score. 

> No option to "include all languages, exclude off-topic"?

 I guess that's still the default (first picture upper left)?

This feature has existed on GOG for several years.

 I'd definitely prefer to be able to filter offtopic but keep all languages in the final scoring, but I guess being in the USA it's not exactly a huge problem if it defaults to limiting things to English since most reviews I see will be in English anyway.

 Very nice. I've seen a few instances of indie games outsourcing localization to untrustworthy companies and getting flak for it, leading to bad reviews overall in the critical post-release window. Having negative reviews be limited to the poorly translated languages will help them notice these issues and not be penalized for it sales-wise in other languages.

 And of course, for consumers, it makes it easier than looking for reviews mentioning this specifically.

 What about platform-specific reviews? For Linux and/or SteamOS...

 Not a bad idea. Would love to be able to select, which languages/regions are included by default. But i guess being bi-/multilingual is too foreign of a concept for US-Americans - again... ^^

 Uhm... I'm not so sure about this. If they really want to tweak it then allow selecting languages that we care about, whether we want to include "off topic" and then maybe per-platform (steam-deck, linux, etc).

 Also, they could at least add "neutral" score, if they don't want to extend it to full 5 score (which I kinda understand, because people can't comprehand it and can't give 3/5 for "OK title that's neither good nor bad" and everything is inflated upwards 🤦‍♂️)

 I see a lot of upset posts on bluesky about this, and I'm kind of on the fence myself. If a game isn't specifically about a certain region or people in present times, then why would I care what language gamers review it in?

 Like for instance, I love playing fantasy or scifi rpgs. None of them are based in any semblance of present day places or people. So ... again, I don't care if a person speaks spanish or english, or whatever, why would I?

 Also, as someone who wants to be LESS insular (especially in these horrible united states right now) wouldn't it be good to get some gaming thoughts and reviews from people from different cultures all over the world? Why would I want to remove all that?

 I see specific "this game isn't translated well" negative reviews totally separate, and feel they could have tackled that issue differently.
