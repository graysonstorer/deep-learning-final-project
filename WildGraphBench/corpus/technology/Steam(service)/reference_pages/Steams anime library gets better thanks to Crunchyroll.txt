COLLECTED BY

 Organization: [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/NO404)

 These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to. That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved. 

 Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors. 

 The goal is to [fix all broken links on the web](https://blog.archive.org/2013/10/25/fixing-broken-links/). Crawls of supported "No More 404" sites. 

Collection: [GDELT](https://archive.org/details/NO404-GDELT)

 A daily crawl of more than 200,000 home pages of news sites, including the pages linked from those home pages. Site list provided by [The GDELT Project](http://gdeltproject.org/about.html)

Crunchyroll has partnered with Steam to distribute titles from its anime catalogue on the platform. Debuting alongside [this weekend’s anime-themed sale](https://web.archive.org/web/20170331223003/http://store.steampowered.com/sale/anime-weekend-sale/), Crunchyroll’s streaming selection on Steam includes some of the genre’s biggest recent hits.

There are currently [20 different shows to choose from](https://web.archive.org/web/20170331223003/http://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=Released_DESC&term=anime&category1=992) on Steam, including the latest season of the classic action series _Berserk_; action-comedy Gintama; hunky swimming comedy _Free!_ and _Re:Zero_, Crunchyroll’s [most popular anime of 2016](https://web.archive.org/web/20170331223003/http://www.polygon.com/2016/12/29/14114196/top-anime-of-2016-crunchyroll). All but two of the shows have a single season available through Steam as of now, but [a forum post](https://web.archive.org/web/20170331223003/http://www.crunchyroll.com/forumtopic-986427/crunchyroll-on-steam-faq) on Crunchyroll suggests more could be coming in the future.

Steam members can purchase individual episodes or entire seasons at a discount. Unlike typical show downloads, Crunchyroll’s streaming shows are ready to watch as soon as they’re paid for.

Note that none of the anime on the service is available in its original Japanese, which may be a deciding factor for purists. Expanded language options is on the docket for Steam and Crunchyroll, according to the anime service.

The shows that Crunchyroll brings to Steam represent a shift away from the mainstream. Shows like _Bleach_, _InuYasha_ and _Naruto_ have been available on Steam for a while now; they’re much better known with broader Western audiences, due to their presence on Adult Swim’s dedicated anime programming block.
