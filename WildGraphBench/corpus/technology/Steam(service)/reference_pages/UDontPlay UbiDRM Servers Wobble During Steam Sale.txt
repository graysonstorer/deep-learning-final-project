The good thing about always online DRM is, well, nothing. The problem with always online DRM is, well, everything. Perhaps the silver lining to the cloud that is Ubisoft’s UPlay system – the infrastructure for its DRM, DLC and other faintly sinister words which begin with D – being offline for a large chunk of the weekend is that it _might_ cause important people to worry, no matter what their paranoid personal philosophy of IP protection might be, that singleplayer games having a total dependency on remote servers is inescapably flawed in a practical sense.

 The downtime, which has prevented folk from playing the likes of Might and Magic Heroes 6, Anno 2070 and assorted Assassin”s Creeds for much of the weekend just gone, was extra-horrible timing as it coincided with the [Steam summer sale](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/07/12/paying-out-for-the-summer-steam-sale-is-here/). So the excited rush of new players found themselves unable to actually play their purchases. You can browse their understandable dismay [here.](http://forums.ubi.com/forumdisplay.php/259-Uplay)

Article continues below

Ubisoft has offered [an apology on its forums](http://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/691193-Cannot-log-into-Uplay?s=bfd7d39d895291ecf699ee791587b4f5&p=8477382&viewfull=1#post8477382), and the problem looked to have finally been resolved as of last night (though scattered claims to the contrary apparently persist), but it really didn’t help that the uPlay login error message claimed players had entered their passwords wrong rather than declaring a fault at the provider’s end.

Between this and Diablo III’s many, inevitable [server woes](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/05/30/devil-in-the-machine-error-37-returns-to-diablo/), it’s been a bad year for bad DRM. Let’s hope publishers are taking note of the effect on their public image, even if they’re still incapable of understanding their paying customers’ frustration at being punished for the perceived sins of others.

The other desperate irony is that Uplay has ‘up’ in the title. If I’d drunk at least two more cups of coffee than I have I could probably make some sort of clever joke about that.

> It’s a good year for bad DRM every year another company implements it.

That could be argued, this year so far has been a badass year for bad drm, 7 million people had the chance to test first hand if fascist drm measures work to their benefit or not.

When UBI implemented their bad drm antics, they saw a huge drop in their percentage of PC sales without a corresponding rise to their console counter parts.

In this sale going on at steam when Arkham City was on a flash sale the forums where filled with people letting others know that when you run out of activations for that game the company gives you the middle finger.

Every time a company comes with crap like this it makes it easier for people to realize where the truth lies, within the community or within BSA reports.

So, yes, it’s been a bad year for bad companies implementing bad drm.

What I dont get is, Why does UPlay (something that’s never worked well for me without me devoting a significant amount of time to it) need to run as DRM when we have Steam on as well? I mean, Steam works just great, it’s DRM, it’s seamless and it doesnt ask me for a password I only use once evert 3 years.

*Grumbles*

I imagine the problem is, unless you intend to distribute **exclusively** via Steam, removing the DRM in order to run it on Steam gives the game crackers an example of how to remove your DRM, making it easier for them to crack the non-Steam version.

Mind you, nothing to stop them pulling a Valve and having retail copies just work like a Steam backup of the game, requiring that you connect them to a Steam account. But I imagine that tends to piss people off, even if I love Steam personally.

Online DRM is obviously, in the eyes of Ubi, good for them and totally unproblematic for users. Hence, from their perspective two online DRMs shouldn’t be a problem for anyone honest, should it?

Yeah I got gazumped by Anno 2070 that way. Enjoying the game, but the uplay stuff after I launch the game through Steam (where I purchased it) is totally redundant. It’s got nothing to do with DRM and everything to do with them getting a slice of the digital market pie. Otherwise what’s all the uplay points to go towards DLC about? And the seriously overt uplay ‘community’ features all over the game’s main menu?

At least it was a laugh creating my username ‘ihateuplay’ and finding out I needed to add at least two numbers because it’s already taken.

I’d guess a) Ubi have no desire to hand control of their distribution entirely over to Valve, and B) UPlay is primarily aimed at those funny boxes that go under the telly, while Steam’s console presence is almost non-existent.

Although given Steam’s servers are equally prone to falling over during sales (particularly when the daily deals rotate) it’s pretty much a moot point.

Nope.

 When my HOMM6 stopped working, I tried Driver to see if that had been affected too, and sure enough, it had.

 I sent an incredibly sweary support ticket to them as a result of this.

And that “Apology” posted on the forums is about as disingenuous as I’d expect corporate marketing to be. It promises nothing and offers no explanation so that the customer can in no way hold Ubi to account legally.

HOMM6 is the last Ubi title I’m buying until they strip this bullshit DRM from all future titles. The other annoying thing about this is, even though I bought Driver SF twice (couldn’t resist buying a Steam copy when it was on sale a while back), it would appear that to all intents and purposes, I only actually own one copy thanks to the game being registered through Uplay to my account.

 Gee, thanks Ubi. Games as a service.

Actually, all you have to do for your second copy is make a second UPlay account with a different email. Most people have more than one email, nowadays, so it really shouldn’t be a problem. I bought two copies of Anno2070 so my friends wouldn’t need to buy one and couldn’t figure out why the other one wasn’t working.

You can’t have two accounts logged in on the same computer at the same time (of course), so you’ll need a second computer for the other account to play on as well.

Fortunately, if you’re connection to Uplay drops out the game still works fine.

I know this, because almost constantly I’d get a message saying that the connection had been lost whenever I tried to do something in the menu. Even after executing the game via the launcher which needs to log in to Uplay to begin. So in the in interim 14 seconds between running the game and seeing the Uplay launcher, to the game proper starting, it managed to lose its connection and needed multiple prompts to coax it into connecting again.

It’s stupid and rediculous, I just wish Ubisoft would use Steam fully instead of persisting with their own ‘special’ brand of arse-backwards shit-fuckery.

No, but if you buy the game it is technically legal to remove the DRM.

 I.E. if you buy the game you have already have right of entry and cannot be held liable for circumventing DRM via the DMCA.

If you’re looking to do ANY multiplier however this isn’t an option as you will be server banned for sure and fighting such bans are often more trouble than they are worth.

In Germany it is allowed to make an identical copy if the copy protection remains 100% intact(oh, the bloody irony), but any modification of the actual files or attempts to decompile, reverse-engineer etc pp and bypass the protection are criminal activities, whether you purchased a license or not, as per EULA and current legislation, to the best of my knowledge.

Actually I think it has. Online is required for registration and a patch, once that’s applied offline works perfectly. I was in the same position and mulled over buying it because of it. Gave it a shot disconnected the network cable and everything and worked – unless my memory is utterly deceiving me.

I don’t know, something eventually gets to them. If Ubi sales drop low enough, they will eventually notice there is a problem. Then, they will either remove/de-fang the DRM or decide it is because of teh piratos and quit the PC market altogether. Both solutions would be good for us.

Don’t hold your breath. If sales drop they’ll say it’s because of piracy and they’ll add even worse DRM. Ubisoft has done this 3 or 4 times now, scaling from manual page checks to Starforce to Uplay.

Driver: San Francisco should be on that list. Only, given the UPlay nonsense, I can see why you’d not want to buy it. But it’s a very smart driving game—one that knows you’re there to drive cars, and makes the most of that.

It’s got nothing to do with stopping piracy and everything to do with stopping second-hand sales, they don’t want to admit that beacause that would upset retailers who deal in new and pre-owned. In terms downloads their reseasoning for it in this case is to extend monetisation of the product.

It has nothing to do with second hand sales. You don’t need always-online DRM to prevent second hand sales, you just need to tie a game to an account. If a person has more than one game per account, then they can only resell the entire account. Always-online DRM has no effect on this one way or the other.

Steam singlehandedly destroyed second hand pc game sales,and the major publishers followed valve’s example (games forever tied to accounts) thus second hand sales of pc games ceased to exist at around the year of 2004-5 (Cant tell exact date as it was not an instant transition)

I’m genuinely surprized that console players had the ‘priviledge’ to own their games for so long as opposed to renting a revokable license to play them… but that ‘error’ will be rectified in the next console generation.

This dirty business practice would have been banned by law VERY quickly in any other industry, but politics are still blind to internet age issues, and customer rights dont exist in the gaming industry.

Nobody actually seems to maintain the Ubisoft servers over the weekend.

You can play, but you have to start the campaign all over again. You can’t load an ongoing game which is using the dynasty stuff (ie the mode you start in by default if the servers are up). So thats as good as not being able to play at all unless you are just starting.

See I have no objection to always-on DRM in principle, but I do feel that when things like this happens, users should be legally entitled to partial refunds. If people like Ubisoft want to run games as a service like enterprise software rather than consumer goods, that’s fine. But they also need to be held to service-level agreements with penalties for failing to deliver.

It really does seem, given the timing, that the problem could have been resolved quickly but no-one was working over the weekend and Ubisoft weren’t going to pay to have someone come in and fix it. And why should they? There’s nothing compelling them to get things working. Even if penalties only kicked in after 12 hours in a week of downtime (7%) they’d at least have to try.

How would you measure the out exactly? I own a few UBi titles, but given I wasn’t playing or attempting to play any of them this weekend I was completely oblivious to the Uplay problems. Do I therefore qualify for compensation? If it was a subscription MMO then sure they could throw you some stuff/extra days credit, but in this case I kind of feel it’s a case of having to roll with it. I guess they could dish out Uplay points, but giving people cashback (especially after a massive discount sale) seems a tad nonsensical tbh.

“…Do I therefore qualify for compensation?”

Yes. If Ubisoft introduced an SLA it should be clear that their obligation is to make the game available to their customers. If they fail in this and there is a period when the game is unavailable, the customers should be compensated whether the customer wanted to play that game during the period or not.

It’s really unfortunate this happens during the sale. Ubisoft games are among the more popular ones, as you can see from AssCreed Revelations winning the the poll several voting sessions ago. Even right now, the Prince of Persia collection (of which only one game has Uplay DRM, so it’s not as affected) is somewhere in the top 5, failing only to match the juggernauts of Skyrim and New Vegas as well as The Walking Dead and Bastion. All 4 modern PoP games are also in the Top 20 for under $5 games.

Their ‘great’ reply rather missed the point. If you have a concerted effort to put you in first place on a ‘Worst Company’ list, then you have a problem – yes, of course, those other companies are worse, but it’s an internet poll that’s going to be seen by people who are actually on the internet regularly, which is going to be their customers, which is still indicative of the fact that they have an absolutely appalling image with their customers and within the gaming ‘community’.

Not necessarily, there should be some middle-ground where if the login-servers fail, they re-direct to another far simpler server that just authorizes any request.

That’d mean something like a one-time “amen to that” passcode on the simple server?

Block the original auth, create local proxy exe for the simple passcode, and you’re past that again, too.

That’s the thing with this idiotic dance: The minute you make it less than infuriatingly nigh-impossible even for legit customers to play, you make it easy to circumvent.

 So it becomes a dumb thing regardless how you turn it.

The way I see it, the best DRM is having forums, patches, releases, ongoing support etc all for paying customers(but public forums, too, obviously, since community and awareness and communication is everything).

 But since that would mean actual customer care, development and support, rather than one-off shoddyport(tm) I guess it seems more attractive to invest into huge authentication infrastructure.

 Or, something.

I have no idea how their illogic works, to be honest.

Now if only the people who wrote negative articles about DRM also boycotted the DRM as consumers themselves(if you get free review copies that’s fine by me, but hating on it in the articles, then saying boy we loves us some free time Diablo 3 singleplayer..), that’d be cool.

 Maybe even directly wielded their considerable power to encourage others to boycott on grounds of DRM?

While these spikes are a big thing for sales of indie titles, I suspect they’re not a big thing for large publishers like Ubi and EA who have well-established franchises and huge marketing budgets.

Boycotting on the grounds of DRM is a consumer choice. While RPS is right to point out the disadvantages of this kind of approach and allow people to make their own purchasing decisions, I suspect they’d come under fire from publishers if they started organising such a boycott themselves.

You’re right of course.

 I imagine a scene akin to Seinfeld’s soup nazi: No press preview copy for you! And interviews, screenies, etc? Fuggedaboudit.

I know this(as well as the relative undersized proportions), but its just so exhausting to get the feeling that all you can do is sit on the roadside with 3-4 other anti-DRM bums while the main culprits continue to drive home multi-million $$$ sales in the first release week, then whine about piracy causing them not to sell thrice that and having swathes of players staring at “Error xyz, can’t log in” at various points in time. Or simply lose all their progress due to bad profile management. Or other such stuff.

I just want this all to end and have locally contained functioning games be the standard.

 Without rootkit / ring0 driver media checks, phonehomes or what have you.

Sadly, Valve are as much to blame for customers ignorance in these systems as the companies themselves. The games Steam store page entries aren’t always 1000% clear as to what DRM/online service is being employed, and aren’t always updated to reflect changes in said systems.

I have a simple rule, if in the product page there is no direct link of valve’s own forum to the game, some thing is up.

Most of the time you even find a link to the product official forum, but you can still find an steam forum for the game listed through the front page main forums link , often filled with drm complaints, or poor port reports, or lack of support from the dev.

As much as I like Valve and Steam, some times it’s evident they downplay any factor that can affect the game sales.

Make that your routine before purchasing anything on steam, check the forums first.

By the way, I found this big and rather useful list of 3rd Party DRM on Steam e.g. games that have additional DRM to Steam: [link to steamdrm.flibitijibibo.com](http://steamdrm.flibitijibibo.com/index.php?page=DRM_Lists/The_Big_DRM_List)

It is rather handy, it has an “Account-based” section (EA/GFWL/Uplay/GameSpy/Rockstar Social), and a “Hardware based” Section with mostly Activation Limit shenanigans I usually boycott but can’t always take notice of and have bought by mistake (SecuROM/StarForce/TAGES or SolidShield).

The UPlay section is also split between games that only require Activation and ones that require an Always-Online connection (for instance Silent Hill 5, Settlers 7, H.A.W.X. 2, Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands)

It also has a section with DRM that has been REMOVED from the Retail section of games (which is likely the preffered alternative) and games that still have the DRM files on them but are Inert in the Online/Steam version.

I’d rather like it if Steam would make these DRM-Notices more prominent similar to their “Low Violence” Notices: [link to abload.de](http://www.abload.de/img/lowviolencerodu3.png) and if they could generally just take a stance against 3rd Party DRM or offer benefits if games don’t have any (GoG manages it… and they also have new games now, including the first Assassin’s Creed, they even have a UbiSoft sale this weekend with largely older titles…)

Try the greasemonkey script “Steam DRM alert” on [link to userscripts.org](https://userscripts.org/scripts/show/123500).

It scans the store page for any 3rd party DRM and displays a big fat red bar directly under the screenshots / trailer box if it finds any. Works great for me.

A friend and I tried to play Splinter Cell: Conviction together in co-op mode on Saturday night after buying it in the Steam Summer sale.

I had login problems with UPlay following by a series of disconnections in Splinter Cell co-op to the point where we decided to give up.

The co-op gameplay seemed pretty good in the short 5-10 minutes that we could play. Sadly the service seems so dodgy (historically, not just over this Steam sale weekend) that I’m not sure we will ever be able to play.

I will certainly think twice and read plenty of reviews before I consider a UPlay title.

Conviction’s offline mode doesn’t rewrite your progress anymore. So all unlockables are available in offline mode.

I’ve never been for always-online DRM (or DRM of any kind), but as I’ve always managed to maintain a steady connection, my protest has just been a sympathetic nod to those affected by it. Well after being unable to continue an Anno game that I was playing just fine the night before, because an _unwanted_ outside service was down, I’m going to be putting a lot more thought into what my money is actually supporting in the future.

..so you are encouraging and financing bad DRM despite thinking its the worst, thus ensuring it will continue to plague the games you want to play?

This approach is always so mindnumbingly shortsighted and dumb. Don’t tell them you like something financially when you clearly don’t and wish it wouldn’t exist.

 You’re the gasoline in the DRM fire.

This article is up to the usual standard of journalism exhibited on this website.

Full of misinformation and propaganda.

For example, as anyone knows who has a legit copy, of say, Anno 2070, there is an offline option. As in, if you rip out your LAN cable/ disable your wifi, and try launching the game see what happens.

It is silly to think you couldn’t do this during a server outage (which I personally did, as others observed in the Ubi and Steam forums for instance).

The only people actually affected, and having no offline option, are people who never activated the game in the first place. Unfortunately there seemed be quite a few during the weekend because of the Steam summer sales. Sure this sucks, but once activated you can play it anytime you want, and if online you get a vastly superior experience to the one pirates get.

If you are so anti-PC-gaming, that you want to not event contribute the discounted price to the amazing gem of a PC game that is Anno for example, you are just shooting yourself in the foot. Welcoming the horde of consolitis, and awful hitboxes and auto-aiming, horrific resolution and texture quality.

Grow up and realise that the evidence shows, DRM is a necessary evil in the face of 90% piracy rates.

My solution to this DRM problem was simple: I did not buy a single game that had DRM outside of the STEAM client itself. Period. No exceptions. If I saw a game I was highly interested, I researched the forums. If there was even the slightest mention of additional DRM, I scratched it off of my list and moved on to the next game.

They lost my sale and any sales that would have resulted in me telling others about the sales that were going on. Meanwhile, any great deals I got and any games I enjoyed in the process, I told others about and got others to buy them. Conversely, if anyone mentioned they were thinking about buying a game with additional DRM, I warned them off of it.

That is a great sadistic approach to PC gaming.

First, miss out on ever experiencing some of the best games in recent years, only because they require a login with GFWL or Origin or Uplay (yikes, a username and password, what I am going to do). Second, perpetuating the endless cycles of increased DRM, as the publishers will just count your lost sale as piracy (usually correctly, seeing as piracy rates are in the 90% for PC gaming).

People like you are the cause of consolitis, that is, horrible resolution and texture quality, awful hitboxes and auto-aiming.

The death of PC gaming – brought to you by the misguided, skewed ideology as the one demonstrated by RavenGlenn. What’s worse, he actually influences other simpleminded fools regarding his gospel.

Meaning, you are mostly just hurting yourself by missing out on great DRM games with GFWL or Uplay, and you seem to take pleasure in it.

Hence, sadistic.
