Can you chip in? The Wayback Machine is fighting for universal access to quality information; we keep the record straight by preserving government websites, news articles, historical data, and more. The Internet Archive, which runs this project, is a nonprofit, and we’d be deeply grateful if you'd join the one in a thousand users that support us financially.

We understand that not everyone can donate right now, but if you can afford to contribute this Tuesday, we promise it will be put to good use. Our resources are crucial for knowledge lovers everywhere—so if you find our resources useful, **please pitch in.**
