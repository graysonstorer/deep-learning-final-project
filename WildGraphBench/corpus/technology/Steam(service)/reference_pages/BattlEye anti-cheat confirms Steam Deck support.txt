BattlEye anti-cheat confirms Steam Deck support
===============================================

By [Andy Chalk](https://www.pcgamer.com/author/andy-chalk/) published September 24, 2021

BattlEye, which is used in games including Destiny 2 and PUBG, said today that it will run on Proton on Valve's handheld.

Epic Games announced yesterday that Easy Anti-Cheat now [has native support for Linux and MacOS](https://www.pcgamer.com/easy-anti-cheat-now-supports-the-steam-deck/), and also works with Wine and Proton, the compatibility layers used to run Windows programs on Linux. The practical effect is that any game using Easy Anti-Cheat, like Apex Legends, Day by Daylight, and Halo, should run just fine on the Steam Deck at launch.

Not to be outdone, [BattlEye](https://www.battleye.com/) announced today that it too will run on Steam Deck software out of the gate.

> BattlEye has provided native Linux and Mac support for a long time and we can announce that we will also support the upcoming Steam Deck (Proton). This will be done on an opt-in basis with game developers choosing whether they want to allow it or not.[September 24, 2021](https://twitter.com/TheBattlEye/status/1441477816311291906)

"BattlEye has provided native Linux and Mac support for a long time and we can announce that we will also support the upcoming Steam Deck (Proton)," BattlEye tweeted. "This will be done on an opt-in basis with game developers choosing whether they want to allow it or not."

This is important. As we [explained in August](https://www.pcgamer.com/garrys-mods-garry-is-helping-get-anti-cheat-software-running-on-the-steam-deck-right-now/), anti-cheat software for many online games has struggled with Proton, and if the anti-cheat doesn't run then neither will any game that relies on it. BattlEye compatibility opens the door to a number of very popular online games on the Steam Deck, including Ark: Survival Evolved, Arma 3, Destiny 2, Fortnite, PUBG, Rainbow Six Siege, and Survarium.

I'm not entirely clear what being "done on an opt-in basis" means—I mean, I know what "opt-in basis" means, I just don't understand why a developer would not want their game to support BattlEye and thus not run on Steam Deck. I've emailed Battleeye for clarification.
