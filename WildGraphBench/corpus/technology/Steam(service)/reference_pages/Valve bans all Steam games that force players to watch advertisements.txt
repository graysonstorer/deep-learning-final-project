Breaking ad.

Valve has emphasised its rules around advertising, explicitly prohibiting games that force players to watch in-game ads.

The [newly-remphasised rules from Valve](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising) - first reported by [Gaming on Linux](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/) - confirm that whilst cross-promotion and product placement are permitted, games that force players to watch or engage with advertising in order to play are not. [**Update:** A previous version of this article reflected the source's report that these rules were all-new, when it fact Valve has now re-emphasised the rules by creating a new section of its terms.]

Nor should developers use advertising as a "way to provide value to players, such as giving players a reward for watching or engaging with advertising in their game".

[![Image 8: Cover image for YouTube video](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/afaO_AuPw0o/hqdefault.jpg)Xbox Developer Direct - four promising games also coming to PlayStation](https://www.youtube.com/embed/afaO_AuPw0o?autoplay=1 "Click to play video from YouTube")

Xbox Developer Direct - four promising games also coming to PlayStation.[Watch on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afaO_AuPw0o)

"Developers should not utilise paid advertising as a business model in their game, such as requiring players to watch or otherwise engage with advertising in order to play, or gating gameplay behind advertising," the rules explain.

"If your game's business model relies on advertising on other platforms, you will need to remove those elements before shipping on Steam. Some options you could consider include switching to a single purchase 'paid app', or making your game free to play with optional upgrades sold via Microtransactions or Downloadable Content (DLC)."

Whilst I suspect most of us would associate this kind of behaviour with mobile games more than those available on Steam, Valve clearly thought it necessary to clarify, in clear English, "what is and is not supported on Steam".

Developers are also not allowed to charge other developers for access to Steam features, such as sale pages, bundles, store fronts, or franchise pages.

Last week, [Valve quietly implmented a useful new Steam feature](https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-now-includes-a-warning-flagging-potentially-abandoned-early-access-games) warning users - and potential purchasers - how long it's been since an early access game last received an update.

Emmy winning Shōgun director joins Amazon's live-action God of War series
=========================================================================

Heard it from the Norse's mouth.

The team working on Amazon's live-action God of War series is growing.

As reported by [Deadline](https://deadline.com/2025/12/god-of-war-frederick-eo-toye-production-casting-2-season-order-1236630007/), Emmy winning director Frederick E.O. Toye will direct the first two episodes of the upcoming God of War series.

Toye has worked on a number of acclaimed shows during his expansive career, including Westworld, The Boys and The Walking Dead. He is also no stranger to video game adaptations, having additionally helmed episodes of Amazon's Fallout series.

Last year, Toye won the Emmy for outstanding directing for a drama series for historical drama Shōgun's ninth episode, Crimson Sky.

The director joins showrunner and former Battlestar Galactica executive producer Ronald D. Moore on Amazon's God of War series. Moore hasn't always been involved with the God of War TV show, only [joining the project towards the end of last year](https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-lands-new-showrunner-in-former-battlestar-galactica-executive-producer) following the [departure of the original team](https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-reportedly-starting-from-scratch-as-showrunner-departs). Despite the shakeup, PlayStation Productions' Asad Qizilbash, Carter Swan, Sony's Hermen Hulst, Vertigo's Roy Lee and of course Sony Santa Monica head Cory Barlog remain involved with the project. Santa Monica's Jeff Ketcham is also a co-executive producer on Amazon's God of War adaptation.

Pre-production for the show is now underway in Vancouver, and casting for the God of War series has begun. Do you have any thoughts on who may play who?

Meanwhile, while we still don't have a release window for the first season, a [second season of God of War has already been greenlit at Amazon](https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-tv-show-getting-second-season-though-first-still-being-written). To quote Kratos, "Boy!"
