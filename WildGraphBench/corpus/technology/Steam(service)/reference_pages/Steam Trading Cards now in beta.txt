Steam Trading Cards now in beta
===============================

Valve has announced Steam Trading Cards, a new service that rewards gamers for gaming on Steam, is in beta. Outed [on Saturday through the Steam Database](http://www.vg247.com/2013/05/11/steam-trading-cards-turn-up-in-steam-database/), the service allows customers to earn Steam rewards for “playing the games they love.”

![Image 5: steam tradingc ards](http://images.vg247.com/current//2013/05/steam-tradingc-ards.jpg)

Those who participate will receive game-specific trading cards that can be collected to earn rewards [such as game badges](http://www.vg247.com/2013/05/15/steam-update-adds-player-levels-based-on-community-badges/), profile backgrounds, emoticons, coupons, and more.

The group of titles participating in the Steam Trading Cards beta includes Don’t Starve, Dota 2, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Team Fortress 2, Portal 2 and Half-Life 2.

The service will expand over the coming months to include many more titles on Steam.

If this had been promoted by Sony/Microsoft the internet would drown under all the shit pc gamers would heap on it.

But, oh, it’s STEAM.

Didn’t Blizzard do this a while back, with WoW?

@4 LOL

@2 Actually if MS or Sony did this it would probably be a lot better as their trophy/achievement system are a lot more fleshed out than Valves.

To be honest I wish I could take back what I said. Coming off as a bit of a curmdgeon :/

If peeps can have fun with it, then fairplay.

Bet the Half-Life 3 cards will be ultr-rare

@zinc I don’t know if WoW has digital trading cards, but it certainly has [an online CCG](http://www.vg247.com/2013/05/15/steam-trading-cards-now-in-beta/) (as well as a real paper one). Is that what you mean?
