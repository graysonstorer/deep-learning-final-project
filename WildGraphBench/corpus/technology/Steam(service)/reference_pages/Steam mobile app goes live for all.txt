The iOS and Android Steam app, announced last week, is now openly available. Launched last week in a closed beta, it allows you to chat with Steam friends, browse community groups and user profiles, view screenshots and user-generated content and all the rest of it. It’s free: install it.

You can buy stuff on it. There’s a cart.

Yup, wonder how long it’ll be until we’ll see Steam games made for Android, being sold through Steam and ignoring the Android market ![Image 2: :P](http://www.vg247.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif)

@3,4 Wouldn’t it be breaking Apple’s terms if they distributed games on Steam for iOS?

@4 I wonder how long it’ll take for Valve fanboys to start complaining when no news for Half-Life-Android 2 hasn’t come out a month after the release of Half-Life-Android 1.

Man… I would start clapping, and I wouldn’t stop clapping, likely ever, if Steam launched an appstore and managed to outrun EAs with it.

What goes around and all that jazz.

I don’t think Steam is in a hurry to launch an appstore, but they do have some pretty excellent indie credentials. If not the most excellent of all.

@8 Chuckle. You can make that happen you know. Just find some part of the code that has a 3 in it.
