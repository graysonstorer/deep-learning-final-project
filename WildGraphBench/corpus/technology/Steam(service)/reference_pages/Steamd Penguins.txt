Posted on[July 16, 2012](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/ "4:56 pm")by[Valve Linux team](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/author/frankc/ "View all posts by Valve Linux team")

Steam’d penguins? Is it a recipe for an exotic South Pole dish? Perhaps it’s one of those bizarre YouTube videos of penguins in a sauna cavorting with the Swedish Bikini team?

The truth is that this is the first post of the Valve Linux blog. This blog is where you can find the latest information from [Valve](http://www.valvesoftware.com/) about our Linux development efforts. Avoid the rumors and speculations that multiply on the Web. Instead, come to the source – a blog where people who are interested in Linux and open source game development can get the latest information on Valve’s efforts in this arena. In this initial post, we’ll introduce the team (and a bit of its history) and then give you a snapshot of what we’re currently doing.

Big Things Have Small Beginnings
--------------------------------

For some time, Gabe has been interested in the possibility of moving [Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/) and the [Source](http://source.valvesoftware.com/) game engine to Linux. At the time, the company was already using Linux by supporting Linux-based servers for Source-based games and also by maintaining several internal servers (running a 64-bit version of Ubuntu server) for various projects. In 2011, based on the success of those efforts and conversations in the hallway, we decided to take the next step and form a new team. At that time, the team only consisted of a few people whose main purpose was investigating the possibility of moving the Steam client and Left 4 Dead 2 over to Ubuntu.

Why [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)? There are a couple of reasons for that. First, we’re just starting development and working with a single distribution is critical when you are experimenting, as we are. It reduces the variability of the testing space and makes early iteration easier and faster. Secondly, Ubuntu is a popular distribution and has recognition with the general gaming and developer communities. This doesn’t mean that Ubuntu will be the only distribution we support. Based on the success of our efforts around Ubuntu, we will look at supporting other distributions in the future.

After successfully porting [L4D2](http://www.valvesoftware.com/games/l4d2.html) to Ubuntu, interest grew within Valve and, as a result, the team and projects we were working on also grew. Currently, our focus is on the following projects:

*   getting the Steam client onto Linux with full functionality
*   optimizing a version of L4D2 running at a high frame rate with OpenGL
*   porting additional Valve titles

Current Projects
----------------

The goal of the Steam client project is a fully-featured Steam client running on Ubuntu 12.04. We’ve made good progress this year and now have the Steam client running on Ubuntu with all major features available. We’re still giving attention and effort to minor features but it’s a good experience at the moment. In the near future, we will be setting up an internal beta focusing on the auto-update experience and compatibility testing.

Since the Steam client isn’t much without a game, we’re also porting L4D2 to Ubuntu. This tests the game-related features of the Steam client, in addition to L4D2 gameplay on Ubuntu. Over the last few months, excellent progress has been made on several fronts and it now runs natively on Ubuntu 12.04. We’re working hard to improve the performance and have made good progress (more on that in a future post). Our goal is to have L4D2 performing under Linux as well as it performs under Windows.

We’ll be posting more information about those projects (and others) on a regular basis. Since this is a new effort for the team, we’d love to hear your opinions about the blog so shoot us an [email](mailto:valvelinuxteam@valvesoftware.com). We also encourage you to leave comments and ideas for future postings. We want this to be a community of game developers, communicating with each other and talking about current efforts and future efforts in a powerfully creative environment.

After all, isn’t that what open source is all about – the idea that collaboration and teamwork achieve amazing things?

Niceness goes from 20 to -20, the less nice a process is, the more likely it’ll run with less regard to other processes. Honestly though, -19 niceness… is sort of overkill.

In Linux, priorities range from -20 to 19, being -20 the highest priority, and 0 the normal.

high priorities (with a nice value under 0) can only be assigned by root, so your example wouldn’t work ![Image 6: :P](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif)

 Steam native on Linux is just fantastic!

I hope there will be more companies supporting this idea. I think the reason for people not to use linux is often not being able to play their fav games.

 When steam is released on Linux and other publishers decide to use this market as well i think there will be a big groth of the linux community. (Which is always a good thing) [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3009#respond)

As for the reply…I’m also arch user, and I think that arch being a cutting edge rolling distro will make steam hard to use. I say this because, in my opinion, Valve targeted ubuntu 12.04 with the long term support in mind(5 years in gaming is a very long time, LTS indeed), so every time you get an update in arch things will get messy(some times ![Image 7: :D](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif) ). Has you already know, I’m not using Ubuntu but damn this is good news. Just give me Steam on any kind of FOSS OS and I will throw some money at it. By the way, I already own some “humble bundle” games with steam keys…so…bring it ![Image 8: :D](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif)

LIMBO has been in „the Humble Bundle V“. Every game in the Humble Bundle has to work with Linux. LIMBO was the (as far as i know) first game in the Humble Bundle that didn’t run natively on Linux but was delivered with a wrapper (made by code weavers) that used wine.

Windows is just click click click, installation done and play. Linux is a whole different world. Just pre-installing linux on computers in store is not enough. You need the know how to work with linux.

Trust me, almost all games can run on linux with the help of wine or other windows emulator and that requires some knowledge on how to operate correctly and can be difficult at times because of graphic or hardware config.

When was the last time you used Linux? And what distro did you use? Ubuntu is as easy to install as Windows, and quite a bit quicker. Installing software from within most modern distributions is much much easier.

Yea, obviously if you need to use a Windows compatibility layer (remember: Wine Is Not an Emulator) things are gonna be a massive pain to set up by comparison, because that is adding in a whole extra layer of complexity to the process.

This would not be the case here, though, that’s the entire point to this.

Though I think your statement is false. I personally would switch to Linux because it would be completely pointless for me to do so.

I don’t need the level of customisation it offers, I like the way Windows works (it’s irrelevant whether that’s a product of habit or not) & I think the majority of users feel the same, it’s missing a lot of key software (yes I know there are alternatives but there not the same) & yes it has Wine which is great but even if Linux had all the games in the world I probably still wouldn’t use it.

I have just installed Windows 7 and Linux Mint, back-to-back. After installing the ATI Graphics driver, it won’t keep the correct scaling options for my HDTV and LibreOffice – which works fine on Windows – has defaulted to US dictionary settings and won’t spell check in UK English. Don’t get me wrong – I use Mint on a daily basis and will probably have these issues fixed after I do some reading up – but the basic configuration of Windows software is easier for those with low technical ability.

Well I have much more support of software and drivers on windows, but i am hoping that support will raise and many AAA games will be released on linux.

I bet after gabe release Steam and port source engine to linux, that ubuntu will be seen as a different OS..

 Now lets just wait that users and closed drivers support will be better in the GPU segment, and that OpenGL be better optimized!

After switching to Linux I’ve found the open source driver support for Ati cards to be far superior to cards Nvidia (which have the best proprietary support, but only for new cards), and most certainly more performant than those of Intel. Nvidia and long-term Linux support or 3D open source – Intel and 3D performance? No.

Thus, Ati cards, getting you the most energy-efficient bang for your buck and having the best open source support (also long-term), both for 2D and 3D are my best bet for Linux (and will keep to be for now). [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3202#respond)

 ATI seem to be struggling with Linux lately – well, I’ve not been able to resolve various graphics problems that friends have found – about 6 months ago now. And yes, they did seem to be running hotter than average too – enough for me to notice.

 Happy to use ATI/AMD if products/support work well.

 Have our fair share of Semprons and Athlons around, and the K325 is neat, especially when paired with the 9200 from nVidia in this tiny little eMachines ER1401 running Bodhi Linux to very good effect.

 Do hope ATI’s probs are all fixed now, but would want to see some evidence first before I’d part with cash for anything with ATI/AMD graphics.

 And…..

 What great news about Steam!

Wanting to run 3 monitors I found I had to ditch my nvidia gt340 for a anti 7750; you must use 2 nvidia cards for nvidia surround, whilst a single anti with eyefinity will do the job.

Nvidias driver for Linux is frankly shoddy; most if not all users differ to the nouveau open source driver as a result, not that I am about to defend ati however the catalyst driver pack whilst deprecating older cards (annoying) seems to work just fine in Fedora 17 x64 (much love to the maintainers @ rpm forge!)

In short both camps need to provide better Linux support before the fanboys on either side can have a poo flinging match … until then for multi monitor (best bang for buck) I have to side with ATI despite being an nvidia loyalist for over a decade.

The 400 series has it too. I researched the 400 series before making a purchace. Its something to do with the new kind of ram they are using with it. Does this for windows too.

 Also it makes it go black-screen-of-death on startup occasionally.

The latter is a huge consideration for me when buying a card. I don’t play with headphones (true 5.1 audio is fantastic), and I don’t feel like listening to the whirring of the ATI fan the entire game or especially when idle.

A well respected company to stand up and fight for us. Gaming is indeed the only area in which Linux fails miserably on. With the Steam/Valve devs taking on such a large task like this gives us hope.

If you need help with Alpha/Beta testing i would be more than happy to help. I have been using Linux now as a primary operating system for the last 5 years and many years before that as a dual boot system.

The only problem i might have is that Steam will probably remain a closed project rather than true ‘free as in beer’ software. Alas, sacrifices must be made occasionally for progress to prevail.

Keep up that hard work!

I also know that as long as you have a Nvidia card as you do not run gnome3/unity most games that exist for Linux as well as Windows are actually ‘faster’ in Linux so gamers will be using their machines more effectively.

It is a shame that your focusing on Ubuntu as unity (for nvidia users) results in an about 50% loss of fps in games (compared to KDE,XFCE,LXDE,etc) in fact all desktop enviornments are better for gaming than unity (although fixes are on the way for ubuntu 12.10)

For example

Virtualbox for example, is available across various distributions, and to use them all you need to do is to add their repository to your package manager.

@Splinter of Chaos – Said “App” model has been practiced in the Linux community for ages, especially proprietary software. It dates all the way back to Netscape Communicator and even early versions of Java.

It works, but it is certainly not well integrated with the rest of the system, since the main difference between distributions is the way they integrate those applications via their packaging software, policies, and such.

There is nothing stopping the upstream devs to update themselves their packages within the various distribution, they “just” have to do the work. I know for a fact that anybody can contribute to Debian, contribution wich would end up in its derivatives eventually.

Hopefully, that means a command-line switch and not a reverse-engineered binary patch.

If anyone on the project reads this, please listen: Self-updating is a bad idea. The only reason to do it is when your users don’t have access to proper software management systems. That means, it’s a reasonable workaround on Windows (and possibly Macos, macports didn’t take off and I’m uncertain of Homebrew), but not generally for Linux distros (or *BSD for that matter), as they have solved the problem already.

They might accidentally delete a few months of work, or all your family photos – or worse, screw up your firmware and render your computer equally useable as an old squishy carrot.

Of course, remember to do backups, and backups of your backups — in case you accidentally erase your backup (That happened to me, five months of hard work just vanished — and now I hate Windows).

This is probably the only thing Steam is doing wrong at the moment- writing the game data and installation into it’s own directory instead of to a userland directory. However, if steam sets up a userland directory (maybe in /opt/steam ?) as a+rwx and not touch anything else, there’s no reason to need root access to install games in steam. And the other directories like /lib, /bin, /usr, /sbin, etc will all still be safe.

However, the best thing is still to have steam keep it’s games and the per-game data in the user’s home directory. Most people will put their home directory on a partition that is many times bigger than their root partition anyway.

Set up a repository and let the distro do all the hard work. It also makes it easy to have updates for different versions of distributions. Plus, if you use standard packaging other distributions will automagically get support as the community can and will port the packages to other distros.

You are not wasting your time or efforts, Valve developing-people. Trust me when I say, you are not. The only, and I mean ONLY reason I ever need/boot into Windows is to play video games.

This project means (to me at least) a day in the future when I will not need, in any way shape or form, a MS Windows installation in my home environment. This is something of a small personal wet dream for me, tragically ridiculable (it’s a word) though that may make me.

You give me Steam with Portal 2, HL2 +E1 and 2, L4D2 and (hey since we’re dreaming, let’s go the whole hog) same day release of HL2E3 on Windows and Linux, and the rest of the industry WILL follow your lead.

I will be there on release day, and I would love to help beta test your client. 12.04 is my primary OS for work and non-work PC use… as I said, only gaming forces me to keep one foot in a Windows place.

Linux is full of games;

-Every java game (pretty much) as java can only be integrated with directX – due to closed sourcing.

 -Most of the openGL games, eg, games on the HPL engine (penumbra, amnesia), GLquake/darkplaces (xonotic, some quake games), various other titles too.

 -Popular open source titles; xonotic, flightgear – (most of these games: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_video_games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_open-source_video_games))

 -indie games often use openGL because of the proprietry nature of directX, it’s cumbersome API and the fact it’s pretty slow.

Looking at SteamStats, most gamers on Steam are actually playing Valve titles. Counter-Strike, Counter-Strike Source, Team Fortress 2, Day of Defeat: Source, L4D*, Portal 2. Other than those titles, there isn’t much incentive to play anything else, at least for very long. There is an incredible amount of indie games on Steam that already have Linux support, and are eagerly awaiting to put their titles on the newly released Steam. Other games that are nonsteam could be packaged with wine at least, or recompiled to run on Linux, more likely that wine packages will happen.

Using WINE takes effort to set up. If Steam or the game developers make the effort to make the game work properly with WINE I won’t complain, although I do prefer native games and will feel somewhat let down if they don’t do a real port.

I love the new blog too, a great source of information directly from Valve as to what is happening with the Linux client, I shall eagerly watch your progress.

A few questions –

 You keep mentioning open source and collaboration, does that mean that we’re going to get the source code for the steam client? That would be awesome and allow us to do lots of cool things and collaborate just like you say ![Image 18: :D](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif)

Is there any chance of some form of early beta of the client and perhaps even L4D2? As a veteran Linux/Ubuntu UK Member I’d be very interested in trying/testing it, even if it isn’t (fully) functional yet. (Feel free to contact me about this or anything Ubuntu related)

I have a couple of questions regarding the implementation:

Will you save games to something like /usr/local/games or anything like it under the games group or will everything be saved to the user’s home?

Also, will you be using rpm to install the games kind of like then in windows games appear installed in the system or will you simply copy them.

Let’s face it, most gamers going into Linux will not be like regular Linux users. They’ll most likely approach a Linux gaming system like a new console if you may. That means that whatever features Linux have, it would be mostly alien to the new user where the most common ground would have been the Steam interface.

Since Steam already allows for launching most software programs even non-Steam ones, why not just make it an all Steam user interface. Just give an option to swap between stock LInux interface and back to the Steambox experience. Think of it like a skin. Whatever version of Linux is used that can run Steam, it will all run identical. A lot of people don’t like to hack their UI. A lot of Linux gaming converts would be crossing over because of Valve and the promises of a free OS platform. Not because they’re Linux fans.

If you add the core open source or free PC utilities like Gimp, Libre Office, VLC, 7zip, and many others in the Steam tools download section, we’d be all set. Oh and don’t forget to include Linux driver auto updates for hardware such as videocards and peripherals too.

We’re happy you guys stepped up when nobody else would. ![Image 29: :)](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=1759#respond)

There are loads of stable and extremely customizable DMs out there already – Gnome 3, MATE, KDE, Xfce, Fluxbox etc etc.

Considering that most Linux DM’s already have much better web-integration than Windows and OSX, it would make more sense for Steam to use a Facebook-Passport-esque credential system and let the community handle the rest.

This should be thought of as Steam being brought to people who were using Linux anyway, not a Steam OS that happens to be using Linux behind the scenes. Also, there is nothing difficult about using Linux on supported hardware and the appearance of the Operating System is pleasing. There is really no reason or need to hide it. Besides, if the guys at Valve decide that it makes sense for them to make an operating system designed for gaming PCs or onsoles I’m sure they would do it and probably use Linux as that would give them the greatest flexibility and control and has no licensing costs. It would be great if they did that and made deals with OEMs to have gaming PCs come preinstalled with “Steam OS”, which would also help bring a torrent of games to Linux.

The only reason I keep booting Windows is for gaming basically. Seeing Valve push support for Linux as a gaming platform really makes me hope I can resign from booting Windows in the future.

I few questions I’d like to address to you:

When you say your only going to support Ubuntu for now, does that mean that you will only actively test and provide customer support for Ubuntu or does it mean that there are concrete technical restrictions to Ubuntu (e.g. tight integration with the package manager)?

How open will Valve be in evolving support for other Linux distributions? Fragmentation is a serious drawback for rolling out non-free software successfully to Linux. A liberal user-collaboration policy could help coping with this amount of fragmentation.

Will Linux versions of games be bundled with their brethren for other platforms like it currently is for “SteamPlay” games? Also, lots of Indie games currently already released on the Steam platform actually currently are available for Linux (e.g. most games from the Humble Indie Bundle series), but simply not through Steam. Will those games be retrofitted to be available for Linux through Steam?

To what degree will Valve reach out to other companies and partners to evangelize and provide technical assistance in supporting Linux?

I’m really looking forward to upcoming updates here! [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=1770#respond)

I just wonder how much of a hard time the whole “openness” of Linux is giving you. People run Linux with all sorts of configurations, some with PulseAudio, some without. Some with opensource drivers, some without. Some with Gnome, some with KDE.

I’m pretty sure that might be rather problematic if you decide to move on to other distributions. I hope all the best ![Image 31: :D](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif) and I’d be very interested to see how you’d tackle that.

(a) “the linux market is too small to invest in game development”

 (b) “the linux market will never grow because there are no games”

Regarding open source, it would not surprise me if the steam client and game sources remained closed, and I personally don’t have any problem with that. I’m mostly looking forward to playing games on a transparent platform that is virtually free of viruses and malware.

 What is wrong with supporting a closed source application or closed source company that will help our lives getting easier, as in being able to not own a Windows just to play and dualbooting every time.

Keep it close, I don’t care, but keep it going on and doesn’t give attention to these open-source requests, developing for Linux doesn’t require opening your source (as long as respecting each library licenses), only means that we have the option to not use Windows anymore.

It’s not often that i send an email to a big enterprise to be supportive. But im really happy with this anouncement as a Linux / Ubuntu user.

I feel that i should send my congratulations to Valve, about opting for supporting Ubuntu and Linux in general with a Steam Port. I really hope that you are successful and find a good revenue in the Linux, like initiatives like The Humble Indie bundle had:

[http://www.joystiq.com/2012/06/14/humble-indie-bundle-5-closes-at-over-5-1-million-most-successf/](http://www.joystiq.com/2012/06/14/humble-indie-bundle-5-closes-at-over-5-1-million-most-successf/)

As for your choice as the Linux distribution, i really think that Ubuntu was the only Logical choice. It is in my humble opinion, the most user friendly distro and most focused to the desktop use (your target market). The choice is really fortunate also in the aspect of the community, since Ubuntu has, by miles, the most friendly and helpful community in the Linux environment. I don’t remember about a problem i had that it couldn’t be solved through ubuntu forums (bear in mind this is just one of many channels Ubuntu have for support). And i think that the passionate support Ubuntu users give to users will also decrease some of the support Valve may have to give to Ubuntu. So it is indeed a very smart and well thought choice. Ubuntuforums has also a good and helpfull “Gaming and Leisure” subsection:

[http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=93](http://ubuntuforums.org/forumdisplay.php?f=93)

As for the first game Valve will support in Steam for Linux, i must say that L4D2 is an excellent title and overall a good choice. However may i kindly, suggest to the steam team to also consider porting at least one of the Counter Strike series since it is highly popular among Linux users (through WINE)?

I could give much examples of tutorials (that reflect its popularity among linux users) on how to install Counter Strike 1.6 , but a search on google will review dozens of tutorials to accomplish it through wine (or best friend since ever).

Finally, i would really like to do something to help you in this new endeavor, although i don’t have any special skills in game development (although i’m a developer). However, i’ve been a Ubuntu user since breezy badger (5.10) and in fact it was with the hardy heron version that i moved full time, since it is actually my primary system (i rarely boot to windows). Recently, i opted for only installing long support releases (like the 12.04 version you support), since i want to have a stable system that is developer friendly and also frag friendly (if you know what i mean ![Image 34: ;)](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif) )

Therefore, if your feel like you need testers for a closed beta, you can count on my help.

Good Luck for your work, let us hope your new adventure can show the world that Linux can be a viable gaming platform.

 I’d like to suggest something. Since you are porting the Steam client anyway, why not make a command-line interface for Steam? Personally, I’d prefer doing something like:

steam search half-life

 steam install half-life-2

instead of going through the GUI.

Maybe you have already considered this, if that’s the case, I really hope this feature will be included.

Good luck! [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=1801#respond)

And aside from the regular command-line, there’s also a better version known as the [Steam browser protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Steam_browser_protocol), so for that all they have to do is link that protocol to the client.

The only thing that’s a bit confusing for the end-user is that you need to know the game’s product number, because there are no aliases for game titles. But writing “steam(colon slash slash)install/550″ would install L4D2, which is very useful in scripting. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2242#respond)

——————–

 Lost Coast on wine 1.4.0, average frames per second:

Unity (3D) – 66,24 fps

 Unity 2D – 71,38 fps

 openbox – 75,04 fps

 ——————–

Basically, Unity (3D accelerated), which is the default desktop environment for Ubuntu users (and the one that the masses are going to be using) unfortunately seems to have a noticeable impact on game performance.

Therefore, if you want to deliver a smooth experience on Ubuntu, you’re going to end up contributing a lot to Ubuntu itself. I don’t have much technical knowledge here, but I believe that a solution will have to be worked up where the desktop “goes to sleep” while a full-screen application is running, minimizing the impact on game performance. Perhaps you should talk to the Ubuntu developers about this.

I also would like to congratulate you on your Linux efforts and wish you the best of luck.

Also I, among the many of the Linux community, volunteer myself for beta testing the client/game(s) in the future. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2268#respond)

But hey, if you keep your source closed – I don’t care – it’s your right to choose the way you distribute your products.

Is L4D in it’s current state able to run on the open-source drivers? I’m just interested if you tried it and what you think about them. Also you should really support more distributions than Ubuntu (I don’t think I would ever use this one again – and it’s NOT because of Unity).

 I love linux. Literally, the ONLY reason I ever boot into windows is to keep up with windows updates (every 2 months or so) and play games that cannot possibly run in wine right now.

I’m largely into Arch Linux, and I prefer it over any other system so far. Through it, I’ve learned so much about the linux ecosystem, infrastructure, and “way” of doing things. I love this OS and linux systems in general. I find them not only stable, easy to use, simple in design, etc, but also the most important: Fun. Seriously, who would’ve thought an OS could be fun to use through its transparency and modifiability? The choices and options? The great community?

I also use ubuntu from time to time on my dual-booting netbook, and so I very much so look forward to your release! Excellent job! I know Steam coming to linux doesn’t mean that linux gets all the AAA games, but linux users also love and want steam, and there are so many linux titles already on steam. This is a very exciting time in the gnu/linux user’s life. Development is picking up speed, we are getting amazing technologies in the near future, and more people are swapping over.

See you soon!

All in all, this are great news, I’ve made a bunch of spenditure on sales and I’m anxiously waiting the moment when I can play my catalog on GNU/Linux.

The choice of distribution (Ubuntu 12.04) in my opinion is good, not because I’m using it (which I do), but because it’s Debian based and there are a lot of Debian based distributions, something that will make porting easier although now Ubuntu with Unity has some distinctive libraries and features. Something that may block some advancement in performance is the use of Compiz in Ubuntu and having it enabled even with games in full screen. Maybe Canonical, that if I remember correctly hired Compiz’s developer, enables an easy way to turn off Compiz automatically when there’s an app in full screen mode (max resolution, occupying the whole screen and without window decorations). They should do it, and I think that they’ve some performance bugs related to OpenGL apps + Compiz. Unity in 2D mode must improve too. It’s also noteworthy that graphics drivers have also their share of guilt.

Finally, thank you very much for this work and for paying attention to you customers needs. I’ll be playing L4D2 on GNU/Linux since day one when it’s available. I mostly have a Windows installation just for games. For any other work related use I can use perfectly a virtual machine.

If I had one request for the Linux version (and all version of Steam), it would be to drop the dependency on **Flash** for watching game trailers. There is no reason Steam can’t support Ogg, WebM, or (if you must) H.264 natively. It’s not a trivial task to convert all the videos, but it’s certainly not hard (give me a server with libav and a shell and I’ll do for you in one line).

It’s a cyclical thing. Valve probably understands that it needs to bleed a little money developing an audience before the “linux future” can even be considered a possibility. Most companies don’t think in the long term like Valve, but Valve supporting linux is definitely a strong step in the right direction. With the way M$ is moving to dominate the vidya game market with its Direct X and Xbox platform is something we should be wary of.

However, many games funded by kickstarter are going to be launching with full linux support. So, it’s not as though the linux market is as small as people think it is.

I think it’s highly unlikely we will get any Valve source code. Maybe a modding API of some kind. Maybe one day, we’ll get some source engine sauce when it’s long defunct, but there are legitimate reasons for being closed source. And one is obviously security.

 so although you are a windows user, you should be happy

 linux, a free, editable, and kernal of the best linux-operating systems found is in itself the best operating system environment to switch to.

the problem though is that most companies (and people like you) are pressured into not developing for linux because of the lack of targeting audience (~%5)

 that means games and hardware drivers are not supported, and it makes linux

 look worse than it is.

if (and it looks like it will) linux managed to have more audience than it did, then there would be no reason to use costly and locked in windows, as linux will win at, well, everything.

and by steam making it onto linux, more people would use, more companies would create, and before you even know it you (windows) will be the %10, and that’s not fun, don’t ever make fun of the lower crowd again.

What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.

Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.

There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=1837#respond)

I’ve bought a few Steam games over the years, but haven’t bought or played any recently simply because of the inconvenience of booting into an alternative operating system (Windows) just to play a game for 20 minutes.

I have a couple of small suggestions:

My first suggestion would be to spam the heck out of this blog. Any little tidbits will do. The kind of people reading this are likely going to be interested in all sorts of nerdy details, like what versions of which graphics drivers are cramping your style on a given day, or where your pain points have been with packaging and dependency management. A steady stream of small details, questions, screenshots, etc. can go a long way to keeping people engaged.

My second would be to release, in addition to the main supported distribution for Ubuntu, a largely unsupported tarball of the Steam binaries and assets that doesn’t integrate with any particular Linux distribution, and doesn’t necessarily do anything at all to help the user sort out library dependencies and the like. I suggest this because it would allow interested third parties to create lightweight installers for other Linux-based operating systems (e.g. using PKGBUILD on Arch) that _refer to_ that tarball released by Valve itself, providing a kind of community support for those other operating systems without any third party distributing Steam itself. If people can get it working, then good for them. If they can’t, then too bad.

I’m worried about the alternative scenario in which people who do not run Ubuntu but who really want to get involved might end up creating and distributing unauthorized re-packaged versions instead. I’d be the last to advocate for anyone doing this, but I can’t help but worry about the possibility of someone deciding to do it without regard to the consequences. This would of course be bad both legally, given the obvious copyright infringement implied, and for user safety, because it would be hard for users to vet the integrity of such unauthorized third party distributions.

Linux gamers are a pretty desperate bunch, it should be much easier for valve to sell to GNU/Linux users than to windows users. Look for example at what Linux users paid for Humble Indy Bundle.

Even though steam will have a commercial interest, there are area of mutual benefits for both valve and the free software community, i.e. open and closed source drivers and the numerous layers between them and the game.

The graphics stack is an area that is really difficult for the average free software coder to work on due to IP laws and knowledge pre-requisits, this focus created by valve could be the game changer we have been in need of for the last decade.

Second, Beta-testing. Will you guys be doing open or closed beta testing, and if so, any idea as to when? I’d love to sign up(as I’m sure many others here would as well).

Regarding support for multiple distributions, it really isn’t too difficult. The trick is finding the documentation you need. Several years ago, I wrote a series of articles about Linux game development that covers how to build a distribution-independent executable & installer, how to deal with SELinux, and more. They were published on gamedev.net but are hard to find since they restructured their site, so I’ve reposted them on my own site: [http://www.mygamecompany.com/articles/index.htm](http://www.mygamecompany.com/articles/index.htm)

Feel free to download my own Linux demos if you want to see how my installers & games work.

I have also learned a few more things since those articles were written, like how to build against older versions of glibc so your program will run on older distributions, how to deal with PulseAudio so sound either “just works” or can be easily “fixed” by players if there is an issue, and more. One of these days I’ll get around to updating those articles or collecting it all into an e-book, but in the meantime, feel free to contact me if you need this info.

Do you plan to limit your testing or supported configurations to any particular hardware or driver revisions? What hardware and drivers are you testing on now? nVidia? Intel 3000? Other?

The state of Linux/XOrg 3D graphics drivers is … mixed … at best, and varies immensely with particular revisions of hardware, distro versions, etc. For example, I recently noticed that FlightGear has tons of rendering problems on my x64 Intel 3000-based laptop, though it’s fine on my x64 nVidia based desktop with the same distro and version. It’s not like these problems are unique to Linux – buggy drivers and card-specific differences are everywhere – but the differences are certainly more extreme under Linux.

I just hope – for your sake – you’re doing this on an as-is, best-effort basis and not planning on actually offering tech support.

That being said, I’ll enthusiastically raise my hand as a potential victim for any alpha builds or early betas. I would’ve been breaking down the walls for this earlier if it weren’t for the fact that many of my favourite games to play under Linux run happily in DOSBox and even if downloaded from Steam are quite happy running without it.

One final thing: _Please_ distribute detached debug symbols (“Debug info” packages) for your builds so it’s possible to produce useful backtraces for any segfaults.

I agree with a few other posters: Ubuntu 12.04 was the right choice, leave the updates to the package manager (that’s what it’s for), add a command-line interface for us junkies, keeping the source closed is fine with me, and penguin hats are a must.

But I can’t help but shake the fear that with some rare exceptions, all that’ll be on the Linux store is Valve content. To really make this shine, you need more than just your own titles up there. You need a massive portion of the Steam library, running natively and without stepping back into Wine. You’ve got to help the industry to work in both DirectX and OpenGL, since many that write for PC only use DirectX. Lastly, you need to get in touch with the GPU vendors and strong-arm them into writing better, faster, feature complete drivers for Linux. AMD’s drivers are a joke, nVidia’s aren’t that far behind, and Palladium for AMD cards is a bit of a crap shoot. Want to make this work, instead of some inane side-project, take care of these problems and the content will grow.

Could you detail whether the client ( or most probably the engine ) will be statically or dynamically linked and if so, to which libraries so we can begin the compatability prep for other distros?

How are you going to deal with the proprietary amd/nvidia drivers, will they simply be a prerequisite?

I own a lot of Steam/Windows games running near flawlessly under Wine and it would be great to access them from the native Linux client. Also I’ve had to tediously configure different wineprefixes, wine versions, dll overrides and stuff to get everything to work but I reckon Steam could give us a hand at this. Hell you could even give developers the chance to “port” their games to Linux using the old method of bundling specific Wine versions + the game.

Also +1 for TF2 Linux hats (or more specifically some Linux bonus content). I don’t dig the game myself, but I reckon a Scout running around wearing a plush Tux in his head would be glorious.

Anyway good luck with your endeavors, and remember, you’ve got a beta tester in me! [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=1922#respond)

Valve, if you read this, please make it possible to launch Windows only games within in the Linux client using WINE. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3258#respond)

Contacting devs that already have linux ports of their games (such as the guys in the Humble Indie Bundle) and getting them to distribute their Linux versions on Steam – especially if it won’t require a repurchase for people who already have the windows versions – would be awesome too. The larger the base of games available the better.

I also think porting TF2 should probably be a priority. Being a free to play game with a large player base, this provides the opportunity to get more testers for the new platform support as there are lower barriers to entry (no requirement for a purchase).

Unless they already do this(?) giving us access to the back-end, would allow us to make our own front-ends, maybe not something that Valve would want, though ultimately would be desired from a Ricer perspective because then they could make use of widgets in fanciful ways, and make things really tie into the GUI.

Hoping for the day when everything starts with OpenGL for Mac/Linux, and then maybe ported to DirectX. Rather than the other way around. In this age of diversity with the ascension of Apple, I can’t imagine developing primarily for DX then treating Mac/Linux as afterthoughts.

Second, a lot of indie games currently support Linux natively, I hope you will work closely with these developers to integrate their games with the Linux client.

Thirdly, as you’re probably well aware, a lot of third party games currently available for steam, while not officially supporting Linux, runs well under Wine. It would be very nice if you could allow for Wine executing directly in your client.

So I think I can say (and I know I speak for many) that the release date of Steam for Linux will be one of the happiest days of my life!

I’ve honestly never been so happy or excited about something involving computers.

 I don’t know if you answer questions here, but let’s try.

What about WINE?

 Really, that’s something I ask myself about, everytime I hear a rumor about Steam on Linux.

 On Windows we don’t have the direct option to modify the command that is starting the game (not talking about parameters), will that be a feature on linux? – I know that I can work around that, but still wouldn’t that be a great feature?

Will I be able to download and install Windows only games that are on my account?, or even buy those games?

 That might sound pretty pointless, but if we combine those two things, this is what I can get:

 ALL my games on steam.

 Without the need of messing around with the terrible windows client. (not the client itself but how it intigrates into linux)

The ability to start a new instance of x, start random windows game with wine and put it to the new x server.

And the games ported to linux out of one single client.

 All in One, just like Steam on Windows! [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=1987#respond)

 I suppose from my understanding the libraries you use, in as static a manner as you can, in the libdir for only steam, and steam links against those? [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=1989#respond)

I wonder if we’ll be able to use existing purchased games (for Windows) with the Linux steam client, or if we’ll have 2 copies of steam (one native, the other under wine).

Also, I’m running amd64 without any i386 libraries installed at all and I wonder if Valve is focusing only on i386 ports or including native amd64 support.

And finally, since I don’t have a credit card (they’re a rarity in my country) it would be great to have an alternative such as PayPal, Moneybookers, etc. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=1990#respond)

ReactOS is essentially an open source, reverse engineered Windows clone that already runs alot of windows software and can use some Windows drivers.

Steam installs on ReactOS, but when launching fails to download and install an update, and even if those files are copied from another machine it gives errors about clientblob

Please “play nicely”. Don’t go sizing your window to the root window size as people with multiple screens almost never want this. Again – if you need help or advice, please ask.

Please consider either building your own distro (perhaps even based on Ubuntu) or atleast unifying the multimedia toolkits to something similar to OSXs CoreAudio. If you do this, you will also need a truly comprehensive testing mode built into your client, to tell users/reviewers whether a particular hardware+distro combo is Steam compatible. This is what influences purchasing decisions.

The Linux market is already fragmented – you will encounter problems of package managers (oh yes ! Fedora users will cry for blood), driver support (which dont play nice with X.org) and even things like HDMI support, etc.

It is going to be very difficult to simply release a client and hope people will band around it. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2009#respond)

My view on the open source issues involved: I believe games are media and therefore don’t have to be strictly open source. You can help with that by opening up the engines. People won’t be able to pirate games legally, because the media will still be copyrighted. Now wouldn’t that be awsome? The Steam Client in the regular Ubuntu main repository?

I think even community involvement would work great, since the Valve titles are all so popular.

 Yes. The Humble Bundle provides Steam activation codes.

 They could get it into the USC as a commercial app through myapps.developer.ubuntu.com or the partner repository or something like that without making the client open source. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3117#respond)

I had a long rant of other stuff I want as a user, but there is one thing I can think of that would really change the platform for the better:

On Windows, savegames are stored is all over the map. Some old games (Deus Ex) store them inside the game folder, and this can’t be overridden. Others store them somewhere in the user’s profile directory, sometimes by game name, sometimes by publisher name, and sometimes even stranger.

You could also stop this in its tracks by asking that all Linux ports of Steam games follow the [XDG spec](http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) for files they create. (FHS would be nice, too, but since Steam will be installing and updating these, it probably makes sense to just make /opt/steam be mostly a mirror of Program Files\Steam on Windows.)

There are other annoyances of Linux games — for example, most don’t allow the user anything like alt-tab. The Steam Overlay is good enough for many things, but if you could either add this through the overlay or encourage developers to allow it, that would be huge. (Not sure quite how to do it. Probably allow the window manager to intercept its global keyboard shortcuts (so allow volume control hotkeys too), and notice/accept when you lose focus.)

It would make sense for these to be rolled into the Steam API, but if any of this is going to be a library, I think it makes sense as an open source one (BSD-licensed, say). You have an opportunity here to build a common foundation for ALL Linux games, whether they’re on Steam or not. I’m not suggesting anything as crazy as Steamworks itself being opened, or even the Steam overlay, just the basic tools for “How do I get the user’s savegames and preferences?” and “How do I allow alt-tab?”

But encouraging this in any form would drastically improve things. So many Linux ports are just a recompile, give you a tarball, and do everything relative to where you untar it to — and those are sometimes the better ones.

The rest of the rant, abridged: Chrome lets you click to download a .deb from their website, which installs a Google apt repository, so it updates through the package manager. That’d be great for the Steam client itself. Support the commandline for installing, uninstalling, backing up, and launching games — but maybe you already do? Jabber/XMPP support for chat, so we don’t need the Steam client running. Libnotify for the Steam client. Kwallet on KDE or whatever Gnome/Ubuntu has for encrypting saved Steam passwords. Allow games to depend on packages — maybe use something like Puppet for consistency across distros.

And I’d love to beta test this. (I’d love to be developing it, too, but I’ll settle for being a happy user.) [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2016#respond)

Remember, if you want this to work you will have to port as many games as possible. Please at least port all of the Source games that are also available on Mac at the very least. Also, do everything you can to encourage other developers to do the same.

If there are games available and they are as easy to install and play on Linux as on Steam on Windows you will bring in new customers no doubt.

I have some valve games purchased half life saga, since I switched to GNU/Linux desktop I do not play them, It would be awesome to remember those games, with native linux engines.

Porting to linux games can be done in 2 ways, the best one is native games, but you can also make WINE versions and a “steam wine way” as playonlinux.

Wine is tricky, that is why playonlinux has several scripts to make their list of games work. And put each of them in a separate virtual disk – folder -

With previous work and a little bit of Steam work you can make work ALMOST ALL OLD STEAM GAMES with wine, and porting to opengl, and native linux – faster and better – 32 and 64 bits versions of your new games and best sellerd old titles [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2026#respond)

You didn’t HAVE to get into Linux development, yet, here you are doing it. It takes time and effort, and probably only a handful of the gaming community actually care about this. But for the ones that do care, we are extremely excited to see how far you can take this.

Maybe Ubuntu will be a first step. Maybe you’ll soon bring games to Android, and possibly the Ouyah. Simple games, of course. I wouldn’t expect Half-Life 2 or Left 4 Dead 2 to run on mobile phone hardware.

Ubuntu is a good start, but please consider others as well. At the very least include Fedora. Arch, Mint, Debian, and Suse would be good candidates as well after the first two.

Really, though, as long as everything is distro-agnostic the community can make it work on most of the big ones.

Games and certain design software applications are the sole reasons I don’t switch over completely to Linux from Windows – I’d rather run them natively for specific reasons. I look forward to updates and the like!

Best of luck, Valve, and thanks for this BRILLIANT piece of news!

I use several GNU/Linux distros

Ubuntu is great, almost 50% of desktop users PPAs and esay to use

I have always one installation of Ubuntu or derivate.

But Sabayon kernel for gaming is far better, 1000 Hz Sabayon default kernel vs 100 Hz ubuntu default kernel – MS WOS is 300 Hz – ubuntu also has a low latency kernel for multimedia that can be installed.

Making a Ubuntu VALVE kernel with Sabayon settings or even better, optimized for gaming experience, would be a great idea and not a big work – the actual ubuntu default kernel is optimized for server not for desktop gaming -

This UBUNTU VALVE KERNEL will make the benchmarks of your native linux games be much better than MS WOS ones, at least with AMD and Intel proprietary drivers, that score more or less the same at MS-WOS 300 Hz kernel than at Ububtu 100 Hz kernel at Phoronix openbenchmark tests.

I would also recommend cooperating with Wine and Codeweavers developers, so that you can also provide ready made ‘bottles’ of Windows games pre-wrapped in correct Wine packaging with all the needed settings and library overrides to make them just work. I love the process of buying games on Steam and I do all my gaming on Linux, but it gets a bit frustrating that I have to set up and maintain several separate Wine configurations for different Steam games and can not just run them all from the same environment.

Native games are good, but I bet you can get more games running just fine faster if you go trough Wine with the help from existing Wine developers. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2036#respond)

Thanks Gabe and Valve for making this bold move. Like many others here gaming is one of the only reasons I dual boot. I am hoping that this move sets the pace for both more game dev companies to start porting AND other proprietary software vendors (Adobe that means you).

With Microsoft heading into tablet land with Windows 8, Desktop Linux is again raising its head and there is hope that it will become a viable alternative productive desktop. This move helps to push it in that direction.

As the Humbe Linux Bundle have shown there is big potential in the Linux desktop market for games. Many games are already working just fine in Wine. As you can see in the WineHQ[1] there are 3333 Platinum, 2878 Gold and 2468 Silver rated applications and games (Platinum and Gold means they are working out-of-the-box with Wine).

But I do hope you are going to contribute to the Wine project. What would be just beyond awesome if your client would be open source. There is no reason to not make your client open source anyway, since it will work only with your service. But to have your client open source would bring you many advantages.

Like free bug fixing from the open source community; Free translations to different languages, like Chinese, Thai, German, Spanish. Free porting to different Linux distributions like Fedora, OpenSuse, Debian. You would have so many more potential customers if Linux users could just go to their package manager and install your client from the official repositories.

Thank you for the port and for the courage to take the opportunity.

However, if I will have the possibility to play directly in Ubuntu, this obviously would reflect in a biggest money investment on the Steam platform

As you mentioned in the post, we are a community and I would really like to offer my support for beta testing (also if this means buying games at full price, no problem at all ![Image 73: :)](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) )

The Valve-to-Linux is incredible since it will provide the infrastructure for others to follow. It will also set a standard for Linux gaming so it is vital for Valve to get things “right” from the beginning. This is a decision by a single company which will result in games running on Linux.

The other project is the Notch 0x10c project, which, if it succeeds, will provide an environment and incentive for learning assembly. Again a decision by a single individual which could create an entire generation of young assembly programmers.

Long term Linux users as our primary platform at home on all our machine for 8 years or more so far.

The only reason we have a Windows based machine remaining is to run Steam.

The sooner we can move away from Windows completely the better.

Hope you will ensure smooth running on OpenSuse as well as Ubuntu and it will work well with other Window managers?

Long term die hard KDE user, then KDE changed to awful so switched to Gnome

 New long term die hard Gnome user, now Gnome has changed to very awful so switching to either – XFCE or Enlightenment.

 Again, Wow. We’ve all been shackled to one OS for so long for gaming (practical gaming). I’m super excited! I run Open Source for stability and transparency in the Operating System, I don’t mind running a few binary blobs. Not at all. I believe in Free Software, like Free Speech. I absolutely am willing to pay for great software.

 I’m a huge Portal & Half Life fan, and will absolutely purchase L4D2 when its available. I’m even willing to repurchase my entire steam library, especially if you believe that would be a source of motivation for the 3rd parties (like Bethesda, etc).

 Thank you for the blog, now I have a one stop place to check for updates, etc. I look forward to hearing about all the things you guys have gone through so far, as well as your future endeavors.

A platform like Desura shows Steam will work; something I’ve had installed via wine for a long time (previously sharing common files with a Windows boot). Windows has long gone but the files are there and Source games already work well; TF2, L4D, etc. Many other games work with a few tweaks, others in the catalogue have Linux versions already (e.g. take a look at the Humble Indie Bundles).

And there’s nothing quite like burning money in a Steam sale. I can’t wait. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2098#respond)

 Actually my brother is now forced to use linux to play some steam games die to no driver support on windows. ATI x1350 has no support for some years now.

 Although opensource drivers do their job very well. He can play all 3 games which he has (Super Meat Boy, Binding of Isaac and Terraria) and he pretty happy with that. Obviously he uses wine, but I bet native steam will run smoothier.

 Actually I can even play Dota 2 in linux but it someking laggy experience. So can’t wait for source engine port ![Image 86: :)](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif)

Thank you for going public with your experiment to support Linux. I think this is one of the greatest news of this year and, if successful, could be a major milestone for consumer desktop experience.

I would encourage you to create an open beta for OpenGL as soon as possible. I’m sure your internal QA teams are very capable and you have lots of varied hardware to test on but there’s nothing like an open beta that available to millions. Remember that you don’t need a real game for that, a time demo, or similar, would be completely sufficient for doing that.

Finally, please get in touch with Canonical if you have not done so yet. We can help you make this better for everyone.

Thanks.

Valve’s been neglecting the big news in a while. Aside from Portal 2, recently Valve hasn’t really been doing much for me to get excited about. Episode 3/Half-life 3 news has been sparse to the point I wondered if Valve is even developing it anymore. And three E3 disappointments in a row really started to make me unhappy. Two no shows and a real yawner about Portal 2 on the PS3 that was hardly big news.

This is big news. Steam coming to Linux. Too bad the debut game is Left 4 Dead 2 and not one of Valve’s more serious offerings like Half-life 2, Portal, or Team Fortress 2. You know, the games that make Valve some real money.

That’s not my biggest worry. My biggest worry is that Valve has chosen only one Linux distribution so far to support and develop for. The smart way would have made for generic Linux development like many other software studios do for proprietary houses then also offer specific releases tailored for specific Linux distributions. By not doing this, Valve now has me worried I will have to use Ubuntu or one of its myriad forks just to use the client correctly. Whereas if they made a general-purpose Debian vs. Red Hat vs. Ubuntu vs. Generic Linux Release then *all* Linux users could potentially play Valve games on Linux.

Worse is that you focus so much on Ubuntu, a Linux distribution that, since 2008, has been steadily declining in technical quality and usability. As of 2012 Ubuntu’s generally turned into a Linux distribution that reminds a LOT of Linux users of Windows, and not in a good way.

Though you didnt ask for my opinion, I think just porting it to Ubuntu was a mistake, one I hope you’ll recitify without forcing us to wait through another 4 years of speculation. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2131#respond)

 Although only one distribution will be supported (initially) it’s really a great news that a big software house like valve is interested in porting game on linux and soon we will have some high quality games on ubuntu [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3137#respond)

I only hope that the rules regarding Games vs OS on steam get adapted, since at the moment, you need to buy a game twice if you want to play them on Windows and Mac OSX (even if it is exact the same game).

 It would be quite a inconvenience for the users if they need to buy a game 3 times when they want to be able to play a game on all platforms, also for keeping track of your game library.

 This is something that Desura really have done well, you buy a game, and not a game attached to a OS, so you can instantly play the game on all compatible platforms (and new platforms can be added later). [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2180#respond)

Miguel says: [July 17, 2012 at 2:16 am](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/#comment-2183) Did you guys ever considered open sourcing Source, I may be wrong but don’t thing Source licensing is a big income to Valve and a open Source will surely drive up adoption. Now of course there are many reasons for not doing that besides licensing revenue, like extra work in code maintenance, competitive advantage and probably others. But although I think is natural that games themselves are not open source I find it odd that the number of open source tools for game development is not that pervasive, given that there are so many programmers in game development that are probably constantly repeating common tasks. If there were more common open source tools available that would probably drive down cost and development time overall that, it’s not like there is a competitive advantage of having better tools when everybody is licensing Unreal Engine 3. In my mind Valve would be the perfect candidate for starting this big open source development tools project with Source, just a thought.

 When this day comes and we all look back at the linux timeline as it climbed to global domination we will see this date and this valve statement as one of the most significant milestones in computing history that pushed down the accelerater and boosted linux into global ubiquity.

Ideally you would be looking at the latter distribution, it is not only one of the most oldest actively maintained distributions but also one of the leanest and most efficient running one.

As many, I’ll be so happy the day I don’t need windows any more to play games (or at least need it only every now and then as I’m realistic enough to know Microsoft will keep at least some publisher bound to DirectX so they don’t lose to many gamers).

 I am sure, you are aware of that problem, but I will name it nevertheless: suitable grapic card drivers.

 You’ll now that one of the main problems when it comes to high performance gaming with linux is that some graphic card manufacturer obviously don’t care about releasing good drivers for their cards (yes, I am looking at you, nvidia!). I’m sure this will get better as more and more people ask for proper driver and buying cards regarding their linux support, but I am also a bit worried that this problem could kind of kill the acceptance of steam for linux (“yay, linux is free and now gets steam, I’m trying this!” -> “What? I’m getting so bad performance and not suitable graphic card driver that would fix that? Screw that, I’m moving back to windows!”).

Love what you are doing, but think its misplaced. I think Linux lacks the Direct X layer that windows provides. And I mean in a generalistic sense. I think only someone like Steam or a large player can actually think in those terms. Linux suffers from ‘choice’ – which means nightmare API, Driver, Window manager issues. For you to bring your product onto Linux means finding a way by yourself – or with others, of creating the core things you’ll need – like a Direct X layer (Sound, Gfx, Controls api layer) – and make it one that is Linux based, but distro independant. Once you have this you can layer steam and games on top.

If you go distro dependant, while this might work short term, I am unsure if this is the answer. Linux needs an API layer, and it needs someone large enough to build, maintain, and be somewhat dictotorial about it. You might have to creat a controlled ‘steam box’ thats got a set of hardware you can count on given current states of sound/gfx/control api’s

I want to add one more thing. I detest DRM. I hate it with a passion. But I’ve been a steam member for a long time, and you guys offer great value, a single point of purchase, your DRM is largely silent and unseen, which is how DRM if it has to exist should be, and you guys deserve great success for making it so, and definging and buiding the awesome thing you have done.

Wish you very well on this venture.

While I hate Steam and all similar systems for their digital rights managements (or rather restrictions thereof) I am happy to see the activity of porting games over to linux. The speed with which this seems to be accomplished suggests that as of today they’re written in a mostly portable way anyway.

Instead of steam I’d also be happy if you’d just support the standard app shops or the old fashioned way of e.g. online shops where one just buys a permanent, life-time license key with which to enable the game. I will never fathom why we need to be online and regularly connected to a centralized server just to be able to play a game that was rightfully paid for.

I have stopped playing Valve games as well as other Windows-only games many years ago when I made the full switch to Linux. The last game I played back then, still from a CD I bought in the store, was the very first Half Life game.

 I enjoyed that game a lot but I never considered to keep Windows just for playing games — everything else I do both privately and in my job as a computer scientist I can do on a Linux computer better.

Bill Carlisle says: [July 17, 2012 at 3:57 am](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/#comment-2287) As a Linux enthusiast who would love to completely switch to Linux, this news is incredibly encouraging. Valve continues to be a company that proves it is willing to step out, take a little risk, and be pioneer in gaming. I do not feel that it is an exaggeration to say that if companies like Valve continue to demonstrate such forward thinking, it could easily and permanently change the face of computer gaming.

Games are the last holdout for so many Linux users, and I’d venture to say it’s one of the largest barriers to Linux breaking through to the desktop market in more than single digit percentages. Wanting to play the latest and greatest games seems to be the one thing that forces Linux users like me to keep paying for proprietary operating systems that we otherwise would not want. If I had that $100 or $200 that I had to pay for an operating system, how many games could I buy with that money? How much more willing would I be to give that money to a game company that was instrumental in seeing to it that I could play their games on my favorite OS?

Making money is certainly the primary reason why businesses exist, but so many game companies seem to care *only* about the money and very little about trying to meet their customers’ wants from their product. It is a welcome relief to see a game company that still prides itself on gaining and maintaining the goodwill of its customers by listening to the community.

Really great news, and I’m especially glad they said that they are wanting the games to work as good as they do on windows. It shows that they are not thinking of Linux as just another platform but as a equal platform.

One thing that would be a really nice gesture and just a generally cool thing for you guys to do would be to release to source code to the Goldsrc games(Half-Life, Team Fortress Classic, etc). I know you licensed the Quake engine for those games but I am sure that wouldn’t mind since they have historically released source code for some of their games including Quake.

I really hope the games that I currently own on Steam, I’ll continue to own on Linux (if they get ported).

I second the idea that Steam should auto-update by using a repository and letting the package manager do the actual updating. I much prefer this method as Linux has the software updates sorted already (no need to re-invent the wheel).

I’ll definitely buy L4D2 as soon as it’s on Linux (I don’t yet own it).

Counter Strike: Source also seems a no-brainer if the source engine has been ported.

Can’t wait for all this great stuff coming, thanks Valve. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2310#respond)

And I think they should. They are basically writing a new app and new game from scratch. Its not as simple as running the code through a “converter”. I’d happily pay to play my HL2/DoD:S on my Ubuntu machines. My only suggestion to the Valve team is to support Steam/games using the Ubuntu LTS release schedule. So support the client/game for the longer LTS releases and the normal releases shouldn’t get updated past their lifetime. Great job guys!

What’s great about this (aside form the fact that I may no longer need a Windows installation just for gaming any more) is that it will introduce the Linux platform to a multitude of other users. Users who may never have tried it out because, “Linux doesn’t have games,” or something similar.

If I might make a suggestion, if you could officially “list” games that are working as your work continues that would be great. Also, maybe mention games that you might be looking at for porting (with no promises), that might be interesting. Lastly, if any there are any of your partners interested in porting to Linux (with or without specific games mentionned), maybe tell us about them too? Sort of “croudsourcing” you advertisement…

You can +1 me to only booting into windows for gaming on steam for what I can’t get working on Linux (and currently seeing so Skyrim runs awful for me on linux I’m in windows quite a bit)

Need to make a Actual Steam Linux gaming group now don’t huh and I’ll +1 an invite to that group also please ![Image 148: :)](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) ?

Desura are an indie/mod scene game client that do cross platform maybe some collaboration with these guys might highlight some difficulties that they’ve faced and help you with this project also but you guys have probably already know/thought of that.

Perhaps also 3rd party titles can be optimised and packaged in wine compatible launchers to launch within the client till companies agree with the viability of porting to the platform.

Happy by all means to test the beta when it comes out for sure!!!

Thanks so much for considering this and starting this effort I’m grinning from ear to ear at the moment as I type it’s a happy day! ![Image 149: :D](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif) [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2358#respond)

I am _very_ glad to see Steam taking these first steps to bring serious games to a solid operating system and distribution like Ubuntu!

While I feel bad that some of our other unix brethren will not be able to immediately benefit from the Ubuntu release, I have high hopes that over time (or through hacks like debootstrapped “mini” installations), the other distributions will get their chance too.

As a Windows business software developer myself, I have always fancied having a crack at writing a game, and whilst I thought about doing something different I thought maybe get more familiar with something like Linux as well.

When Steam started, I hated it. We needed to be online to play Counter-Strike on LAN parties. But now I can’t think of a better gaming platform than Steam. Sure, it has its drawbacks, but what doesn’t. Bringing Steam and the Source engine to Linux is just another step toward the best gaming platform ever.

Keep up the good work, show them that Linux can be a gaming OS, you just have to really want it!

All the best

A couple suggestions:

I run Steam frequently under Linux using Wine so that I can do my normal work while my Windows games download. It would be really quite nice if Steam Linux were to share the install path (Windows & Linux launch executable in the same directory) and allow me to download/update game assets for the Windows as well as Linux.

It would be especially nice if this applied to games as well, in that if Portal 2 for Windows is already installed, only a minor platform-specific update is needed to play it under Linux. This seems obvious so I’m sure this is the plan already.

A CLI interface (as described above) is a wonderful idea, seriously. Also, give us an interactive, ncurses-based shell that I can jump into with a single keystroke while gaming, have all the features of the Stream client (purchasing, chatting, backup/restore, controlling/monitoring/throttling download activity) and I’ll love you guys for life (more than I already do, of course).

Well that’s all I can think of for now! Best of luck and looking forward to all the super-secret awesome stuff to come from Valve in the near future. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2378#respond)

Short teaser videos would be great, too, perhaps with someone speaking over them. They could just be showing off a given feature, or talking about a daily hurdle that needs to be overcome in the code? I dunno. I think this stuff is fascinating, and I’m really pumped for the final product. I’m gonna redownload and replay so many of my current Valve games, if and when they are offered as Linux ports, and I’ll be especially glad to see new ports from other developers as they follow suit. Thank you for leading the way forward on such a large undertaking!

Oh, and if you need a beta tester after your internal tests are done… I’m using an older version of Ubuntu because I enjoy the classic desktop more (11.10), but I’d gladly upgrade to stress test this project. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2386#respond)

If a solid games market like Steam were to hit Linux I think it could really legitimize the platform for others to start supporting it. I know Desura is already on Linux, but they don’t have enough bigger named games to bring real attention to Ubuntu or Linux in general.

I also think Ubuntu is a great platform to start on because it will be most friendly with a growing user base. It may even help pull new converts to Ubuntu. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2422#respond)

Will you make it easy for third party developers who already have linux versions to combine them into steam play? I have lots of indie games that have linux ports that I would probably start using through steam if that works.

Also are you still planning on porting all the source games? Dota, Portal, Counter Strike etc? Dota 2 would be my highest priority right now.

Also does this mean HL2:E3 will get a linux release day one? (This question is mostly tongue in cheek) [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2425#respond)

As far as additional blog posts, I heard mention a few different times that you guys are working to try and get other developers on board with supporting Linux. I’d like to hear more about that. Also, with Linux you all are now in a position that instead of finding workarounds for flaws in the underlying systems you can just fix them (or maybe you were able to wave your top-tier developer wand and have Microsoft fix it before…). Are there any plans to commit to upstreams?

Also, I second 10098′s suggestion of command-line interfaces. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2426#respond)

Same here. I believe a lot of people have Windows solely for games. And Steam/Source on Linux means no more reasons for Windows on my machine. With clumsy Windows 8 coming, it’ll be be great news.

And I can’t stop wondering some things… like… imagine the results of a *UBUNTU ONLY* early access to a beta version of HL2E3. Or a double drop rate week in TF2 coupled with exclusive hat…

All these years, I’ve been showing my support to Valve in the best way I could: purchasing games in Steam and several items in TF2. I always felt rewarded, never felt like Valve was letting me down (unlike some other companies…)

Now, this feeling is stronger than ever. I want Valve to reach unprecedented levels of success. I want Valve to write history itself. I want Gabe and all Valve staff to become the richest men and women in the world. I want all the other companies to envy Valve so much they will cry like babies.

And I’ll do my best to make that happen, showing my support on Steam Store. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2428#respond)

 Maybe it’s because of the increasing popularity of Ubuntu, Humble Indie Bundle, Android, OpenGL, Wine, Desura, etc. I don’t know for sure, but what it really matters is that you are bringing Steam to us, Linux users, Linux gamers.

I hope lots of people drop Windows and start using a better OS (Linux) because of you. The internet needs this.

And I’m going to play A LOT of L4D2 and other ported Valve games when this comes out. I’ve been using Steam under Wine since 2007 and I’m willing to play most of my games under native Linux. Even if I have to buy my games again, your effort in bringing Steam to Linux deserves that.

 I was waiting for the day which I could play my usually games (HL, Portal, CS, L4D, ..). The announce of STEAM to land in linux was… incredible! Maybe you don’t know, but you are doing history. Since now, you will change the panorama of games in operating systems. ‘Cause the first -and bigger- reason to stay in windows for many people was… Video games. You know, In one hand you’ve got free software, easy, with support of community, … and in other hand you’ve got windows or Mac, with pay-for-everything, headaches-updates, …. but they’ve got videogames.

I’m talking about me, but maybe someone has the same “idea”: I’m waiting to move from windows to linux. ’cause you are changing my world and I will be there, waiting the day wich L4D or Half Life for example, see the light in linux thanks to you.

I hope that the native Linux version of Steam will not prevent Windows-only games from an attempt to launch them with Wine (of course nobody would expect you to officially support this, just don’t block it).

Other than the Humble Indie Bundles, I’ve been buying games exclusively on Steam for the past couple years. Thank you for supporting my platform of choice. I wish you luck and hope that you continue to bring more games to Linux. I have a very high opinion of Valve based on experience and your track record, and hope you continue the great work.

I barely ever use Windows, and when I do it is almost always for gaming. Being able to access steam on my Linux boxes will make me more likely to both game more and buy more games.

Also, kudos on going with the popular Ubuntu platform. Mint is my preferred distro, but as a very close derivative of Ubuntu, there is a 99% chance that whatever you do for Ubuntu will work with it too. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2464#respond)

It’s funny that one of the few areas of software that have good cause to be proprietary is content, specifically games. I think there is a place for open source games development, and certainly indie games development, but big studio and backers like Valve also bring tremendous games and set a bar for all.

On the Steam side, L4D2 will be an immediate purchase for me, if i can get it to run on Fedora 16/17, unless in the next few months I do revert to Ubuntu. One thing I would also love to see is my Humble Bundle games with steam keys being redeemable and install-able through this new steam client.

I really appreciate the core steam software being decoupled from a single OS, and being made availble to Linux, and I would love to see it become more of a platform abstraction that could be ported and supported across the multitude of distro’s, even in an open source way, get the community to maintain some stratum of the middleware software for their platform. If i can boot to Archlinux, Beos, BSD or Mac and play HL2 or an extention (DoD) then that will truely be an awesome day. Half life on my XBMC on the 48″ tv with xbox controlers,, nerdgasm.

 Once again Valve define them selves, as the company within the industry; with the power and the balls to try and change the world; I like it!

Though the move to the Linux platform probably wont affect me much, as a devoted Microsoft user, this is one of the steps the platform needs to become (more) successful!

However, this change in platform also brings up a few questions;

Which limitations will Steam for Linux have?

 Which requirements will Steam have? (KDE/Gnome/Console?)

What will Valve do, to make 3rd party games available on the platform?

Will we see a lot of tips, tricks and research results from the conversion of Source, which may apply to other games, so that we as fellow developers will have an easier time bringing our games/apps to the platform?

How will Steam handle the requirement of 3rd party libraries on Linux?

 eg: Mono, for ‘easy’ portability of .net powered applications.

If a game is published for both Windows and Linux, which limitations will be okay between the 2 platforms?

How are game-developers supposed to handle the use of Windows-.only libraries?

Am looking forward to follow this blog, hopefully having the questions answered!

Regarding the issue of having to support multiple distros. I really think that won’t be an issue. The Linux community has a s**tload of people who would do that for you for free.

 So since you probably won’t open source the whole client because of DRM how about a libsteam? You would just need to maintain a binary blob library that provides and API with all the stuff people aren’t supposed to see the source code of and the community will do the rest.

 It would also open the way to just build a console steam client ourself as mentioned in one of the comments above.

 Of course even more awesome would be if the full steam client went opensource but that’s probably unlikely, maybe one of the dev team can answer that question.

 Though if it’s a binary blob i see some ugly LD_PRELOAD hacks comming.

Don’t get me wrong, even if the full thing is just a binary blob it is awesome. But partially/fully open source would be even more awesome. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2486#respond)

I literally use it for nothing but games. It felt so foreign and clunky to me when I installed it after using only Linux for so long.

But I’ve always avoided Steam. Always. Why? A remote company controlling my game library, ridden with DRM, revoking titles I’ve already bought and in general letting me only “borrow” what I purchase? Please. That’s disgusting. I cursed Bethesda with every curse in elvish, entish, and the tongues of men for the treachery of requiring Steam to play Skyrim.

And yet… if it comes to Linux… by golly I may just use it. I feel so hypocritical, so treasonous, so despicable.

The only reason left for Windows existence is for Gaming and things like Netflix.

 Using WINE is awkward at best but can work.

Having Valve and Steam natively on Ubuntu is something I’ve been hoping for, for years.

I’ve run Steam using WINE on an old PC with Ubuntu and even got Portal running when you guys offered a Free giveaway to sign up.

Really, think about it, for a lot of people, why do you need the cost of Windows at all when Steam can run natively in Linux. Cost savings to the consumer means more money available to spend on Games.

I’m Happy you guys are porting it to linux, although since i don’t use Ubuntu I wont benefit yet but this will definitely encourage me to continue buying steam games, and the prospect of a native gaming system excites me.

It doesn’t matter how well you port the Steam Client and Valve’s own library if people can’t get access to the popular AAA games they just won’t use it. I enjoy the fun indie titles out there but the AAA games are the ones that will drive this.

Hopefully you’ve got some business people looking at this as well as developers and they’ll get early versions out to as many game studios as they can. So more testing and porting can be done before the client is launched.

Just want to say thank you so much for you effort in porting steam to linux. Although I still use Windows for gaming, I only boot into Windows once a week for a good gaming session.

The rest of the time Linux is my workhorse. Linux runs my entire business and the machine is always doing something. Previously I had Steam working via Wine and I softlinked my data directory to my Windows Steam directory. That allowed me to actually buy games and download them in Linux, ready to be played over the weekend.

For some reason my Wine+Steam setup broke, and at that exact moment I also stopped buying in the Steam store.

I’m really looking forward to the official launch of the Linux Steam client, as mine will be running all the time.

Thanx guys! [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2590#respond)

Also – and this is just a brainfart – you could allow the steam client to launch windows-only games using wine if they’re supported well enough – offcourse prompting the user that you’re not responsible for any crashes that might occur when installing.

        *   KoFFiE says: [July 26, 2012 at 6:08 am](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/#comment-3487) I’m sure you could cook up something to authenticate the USB drive install by having an authentication token based on the flash serial number – why would the computer need to “belong” to that account? That’s the whole idea – that you could use any PC. You would only be using the CPU/GPU/network connection/keyboard/mouse. You wouldn’t need to touch any data present on the pc or change any configuration. If you would reboot and unplug the usb stick, it would start up like you never played any game on that computer.

And regarding the video drivers, yes – pre-install the most common (nVidia/ATI-AMD/Intel) on the drive. You need network anyway, so this Linux distribution could download or update them automatically if needed (actually it could update the whole system), steam already has auto-updates, so that shouldn’t be a problem.

And once network setup is done – preferably also without any user interaction if possible – you just log in using your steam account. Games would be stored on the drive you booted from in the first place, so would be readily available – or downloadable on the spot.

The only real issue I see is per-game graphics settings, if you happen to play on a way better or worse hardware, where you would have to reconfigure games, but I’m sure workarounds could be found for this-one with auto-detection of recommended settings or profiles.

It should be made as fool-proof as possible, allow anyone to create and a “steam” usb-drive, or hell – even sell them pre-installed. Just insert stick, boot from it, log in, download your games and play. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3487#respond)

Games like Shank, Frozen Synapse, Super Meat Boy, Amnesia: The Dark Decent, and so many more… (of which us Linux gamers have repeatedly paid an additional dollar here and there to make sure that big companies knew we existed.)

From someone who has 200 games on Steam, count me in to make Steam practically my default choice for buying games now that you guys support my main OS Ubuntu!

I am well aware that it is still solely up to the developers to make a Linux client of their game, but at the very least games released on Unigine, Source Engine, and Unity 4 will be available to me and that means quality games.

Sad to see that companies such as Id, Unreal, Crytek, and Dice choosing to be so closed minded with their engines.

I would love to hear the reasoning behind your Linux-push. Do you see an untapped market, feeling squeezed by Win/Mac App-stores or just think it would be cool having Steam running on Linux?

Gabe mentioned that Valve was talking to partners about the Linux client during E3 and it would be interesting to know how you plan to encourage publishers/developers to release Linux-versions of their games. Somewhat related to this It would be interesting to hear where you see Linux heading on the desktop. To really grow we need to get OEMs onboard and get Linux preinstalled on new computers. Are you talking to OEMs and actively trying to grow the Linux-market?

As mentioned above it would be really awsome if you somehow integrate Wine/Dosbox for titles that don’t have native Linux-versions but run well in Wine. An option to install Windows-versions through Wine at your own risk or something would suffice.

Those are topics i would love to have your opinion on i you feel like it!

Nice moves, was impressed with the actual affirmation of a native steam client. Being first is always going to be rocky.

Perhaps it might be an idea to reach out to all Distro builders for a universal acceptable install / update method vs a distro specific release.

Upgrading of the steam client and installed games should be done OTA ( Over the air ) when running with internet available ( as it is with Win32 and OSX ). So the requirement of package management is really a moot point.

Personally I use Slackware Linux ( Long time user ), a simple bin installer would work I think ( like LOKI used and Quake3A ).

Package maintainers can also do their thing as per the .rmp .pkg crowed.

893.   Kane says: [July 17, 2012 at 12:40 pm](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/#comment-2705) Thank you, Valve. I don’t think I can say “thank you” enough.

I’ve tried numerous times to ditch Windows as a permanent addition to my computer, but always come back because of gaming. Now, with the perpetual “no demand” cycle breaking before our eyes, there is light at the end of this tunnel. And just in time, too! With Windows 8 coming, that is a train-wreck I’d like to do my best to avoid like the plague.

If there is anything I can do to offer my assistance, ANYTHING, consider this my offering. I already have a wonderfully massive collection of Steam games and will continue to give you my money. I’ll also happily take up any beta offering you put out to the public and test it until I’m blue in the face and hands.

Again, thank you!! [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2705#respond)

 As a result I can’t easily run most of my paid-for Steam games so I buy the Humble bundles instead.

 I tried buying my wife the Popcap collection on my Ubuntu box, using wine, but Steam couldn’t open up the paypal interface, so I had to boot into windows just to make the purchase.

As an avid player and old time linux user i have been waiting for steam/source on linux since 1998 (yes, back in the days of half life), this will be a *real revolution* for Linux as desktop environment.

While i understand why it’s critical at this stage to focus your strengths on a single linux distribution, i would suggest to release a “generic tarball” /with binaries) too to ease the integration/testing on other distributions (i prefer to use Gentoo for instance).

As others have mentioned, the only reason I boot up to windows is cause of games. All my needs are met on Ubuntu minus games.

Imagine for a moment if Valve decided to go this route after Vista. Linux wasn’t ready to pounce on MS last time. Can you see the early backlash for win8? Now imagine a Valve console with easy ports to Linux a few months down the road launching in 2013.

I’ve been running Steam on Ubuntu for a while now (via Wine), and while it performs pretty well, being unable to access the overlay while in-game (due to having gcc 4.6, only 4.5 supports the overlay, and no LTS version of Ubuntu has that) is a serious pain in the ass. Having to quit out of games just to check messages is something I could really do without.

I think what they should do is create a generic binary for Steam and let the distros handle the packaging. This way we can all benefit. I for sure wouldn’t want to change my distro just for Steam.

This will finally let me completely switch to GNU/Linux… For other

 games like Fallout, wine will be good enough i think.

Here are some further ideas for steam/source on GNU/Linux:

* You could provide a cool command line interface (steam install hl2dm,

 steam –list, steam update)

 * Make use the system’s native package manager (pacman, apt/dpkg,

 emerge, yum, …) -> custom repositories

 * Maybe even use the public mirror servers of the distributions for

 content downloads

 * Let users log in to Steam with a Linux Laptop and PC simultaneously

 * Please let users download games from their library even if it isn’t

 officially supported under GNU/Linux yet (You can enable this with a

 option in the steam-client settings). This let’s us try to play it with

 Wine etc.

 * Installation of Games on a PC with non-root privileges (e.g. .steam

 directory)

 * Configuration of various settings of steam and source with .conf-files

 * Provide some Gentoo-friendly parts of the Source-Engine for native

 compilation

Only for the the client, which should be a given. On the app side, that would be a logistics nightmare and negate the whole need for Steam as a download client. Besides, it’s not like Valve hasn’t invested in infrastucture for their own download mirrors.

Let users log in to Steam with a Linux Laptop and PC simultaneously

That’s been a restriction of Steam from day one. They didn’t change it for Macs. I don’t see why they’d change that just for GNU/Linux.

Please let users download games from their library even if it isn’t

 officially supported under GNU/Linux yet (You can enable this with a

 option in the steam-client settings). This let’s us try to play it with

 Wine etc.

You can’t play Steam games without the Steam client, and I’m not sure how that interaction would take place when _Windows_ games interact the _Windows_ way while Steam is running native in Linux. Steam (and quite a few of its games) run just fine when _the whole show_ is run under WINE.

But you suggestion does provide another benefit. If Steam’s files reside on a partition/drive shared by Windows, Mac, and/or Linux, you can download under the non-target OS without interrupting your work and then reboot into another to play the game when work is done.

Installation of Games on a PC with non-root privileges (e.g. .steam

 directory)

They already do this on Windows just fine. The Windows user just has have the proper access to the files. The games themselves, however, are a different story.

Provide some Gentoo-friendly parts of the Source-Engine for native

 compilation

I think you mis-understand how the Source engine is used. Or maybe I do. But it’s my understanding that Source is not it’s own binary executable that Source games can call upon. Each game incorporates its own copy of Source Engine’s code. Each game tweaks it to its own needs. A good example is Portal. I’m pretty sure the tweaks they needed to make to Source could very well hamper or even break Half Life 2.

You could provide a cool command line interface (steam install hl2dm, steam –list, steam update)

Configuration of various settings of steam and source with .conf-files

YES! Something we can agree on! Unfortunately, I don’t see this happening because Windows and Mac OS X _do_ have a CLI and there’s no CLI for Steam in sight. I know it’s shunned on the other platform by the general audience, but the power users know how to use it, and they would have graciously shown people what Steam could do on the command line if Valve decided to implement it. I can only hope Valve’s Linux team gives the company a few pointers. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=2878#respond)

When it comes to all the achievements we have seen Valve accomplish since it first created Half-Life, it is amazing what one small company could have done against the large corporations like EA and Activision that don’t care about gamers needs and wants at all. Even Half-Life 1 itself is still amazingly entertaining to play, despite being 1.4 decades old. Each title released since then has revolutionized some section of the gaming community, and the introduction of Steam brought sunlight to the PC gaming world. Now that Linux is getting Steam, companies like EA will be a laughing matter, they are already. The first to revolutionize Linux, Valve will go down in history books for many great things, and EA will forever be painted as a cancer to the gaming world.

It would be nice if Valve also integrates the Ubuntu Software Center into Steam so that you have a software center tab. As well, the major obstacle Valve will have to overcome is fixing everything about Linux that has made it hard to make it a viable gaming platform, which will not only help their own games, but gaming worldwide on Linux.

Linux scales from supercomputers to smartphones and to desktops and servers, who wouldn’t love this? It’s an incredibly beautiful and powerful OS.

It will be even more amazing now that things like Wayland and Steam are coming, I can predict that drivers will only become more robust (they already are very good IMHO), especially those that ship with the kernel.

I also envision that we’ll get more programs (for gamers), and more games will be ported within a few weeks after Steam is launched on Linux.

I can also see gamers choosing Linux and loving it, after they see the benefits of the system and how the games runs better on Linux than on Windows, and how Linux outperforms Windows in benchmarks with the latest games, etc.

This will be amazing and huge, I can already see that.

I think what Valve should do is decide if they are going to make Steam and the games use bundled or system libraries (bundled libs will probably be easier) and then package Steam as a xz file, and let the distros handle the packaging.

Packaging probably won’t even be needed since we could just extract an xz file (that contains the Steam files) and then just run it inside your home dir. That would be pretty sweet.

I think Valve should just worry about bundled libs, system libs or dynamic/static linking. The rest is just irrelevant because if they decide this well it will work with any distro. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3034#respond)

I would love to know more about how you implemented it though.

 Since you are going multiplatform, I was wondering if you guys are going to use something like the Qt framework.

It’s a very convenient C++ framework that works cross platform and would relieve you from many platform specific problems.

Anyway, great work. Linux users are great supporters, if you give them something good, you’ll get the best support you’ve ever had. Humble bundle has proven again and again that Linux users are willing to pay *IF* they know that the money is well used and that it respects their convictions.

I hope you are not working on dirty things like DRM modules etc… Because this would ruin all the efforts you are putting on the bringing Steam to Linux.

Best regards and best luck,

This is all great and interesting news.

But I think you should look into integrating the Steam client into the Ubuntu

 Software Centre instead of making a stand-alone client.

Lots of purchasable games and magazines already exist here, and it would

 be natural to find your products in here too. The Humble Indie Bundle 5

 was publishing though the Ubuntu Software Centre and it worked nicely.

Also, like any other system updates, game updates would automatically be

 pulled by users/customers as the game updates integrate with the rest of

 the Ubuntu update functionality. Again, I recently automatically received

 an update of Bastion.

It’s really the real Ubuntu way of doing things, and would pave the way to

 success on this new platform. I’m sure the people at Canonical can help

 you with the technicalities if necessary.

Just my humble opinion =) [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3020#respond)

 On its own Dos was rubbish, with games as a motivator.. you have the MS of today.

Same could happen in linux, where there is a closer relationship between user and hardware, with less bloat in the middle. Less lag on slower PCs. All it takes is another “half life” popular title only available (or with linux only perks) on Linux initially.. and people will go to the trouble of learning. Dual boot friendliness could see entire demographics migrating over in the long term.

Valve could also pull another “DOSBOX” trick using something like WINE in linux, and their entire catalog could work short term while they work long term to properly port stuff.

Pity they seem to be limiting themself to ubuntu, but if you build it they will come, i imagine the community will port/hack it to work just as well on any distro you want. Ubunto is rapidly overtaking redhat and its children for user friendlines combined with carefully restricted bloat.

If they pull this off, we may yet escape MS with its steering of the IT industry towards the IP law and innovation criminalised dystopia they have been trying to create.

But then steam does get a little close to a DRM dystopia too. They need to make it more distributed/peer to peer.

In any event it will be history being made if they get it right. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3028#respond)

Diversity is linux’s most important attribute, everyone can have what they want and if it doesn’t exist then you can just create it. And anyway, ubuntu isn’t part of linux for as much as i’m concerned, this distribution is destroying linux’s spirit and in my point of view should be boycotted.

Well, after that, i commend vavle for their effort in porting steam, this is a very good initiative. Next step would be an open source engine(just like idtech) and client(and maybe the total avoidance of DRMs). Also i hope just like everyone else that other game studio could join(THQ for exemple and square enix too) and that you wont restrict the client to just ubuntu.

 I also hope that this wont bring more users to that… thing called ubuntu. There’s already far too many of them anyway and everyone’s going to view it as the “official” linux distro soon enough i fear…

I think this will make money for them, no doubt. I am in line to repurchase every game I currently own again, if they support steamplay on Linux, to support this effort.

A few suggestions (although likely mentioned already, or Valve has though of them also):

 1. Make a statically linked binary (to avoid dependency issues) that bootstraps itself (like in windows, not sure how OSX works).

 2. Do your own “repo” like in Windows, for games. This way it should not matter which distro you use. Don’t bother supporting any Ubuntu specific apt repo. Ubuntu is only a fraction of the user base.

 3. Don’t pay attention to free software extremists. Most of us welcome proprietaty software where it makes sense (in this case it does make sense).

 4. Include a CLI (as suggested previously). The target audience will appreciate it.

 5. Stick to POSIX interfaces. Maybe you can even run on the BSD kernels; maybe you can reuse the OSX code base.

 6. Tune performance so that we get bragging rights over the Windows noobs ![Image 258: ;)](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)

 2. Every distro is different, has different libraries, and often maintains differing patchsets for the kernel. Being distro-agnostic can be harder than it looks.

 3. Like it or not, the ~~nutjobs~~ extremists at the FSF are the centerpiece of the Linux community – they maintain the tools that make Linux more than an academic curiosity, they make the licenses and uphold their legality, they coordinate campaigns against corporate power-grabs like SOPA/PIPA/ACTA and Windows 8′s Secure Boot. When they talk, people tend to listen.

 4. Steam already has command-line parameters, IIRC.

 5. POSIX may be fine and dandy, but I’m not sure if the performance is up to snuff for Steam and Source. I agree, however, that at least some OSX code will probably be reused.

 6. So you’re suggesting that Valve buy out ATI, Nvidia, _and_ Intel’s GPU division, buy the rights to any applicable patents, and open-source all the relevant IP under the GPL? (Only way kernel.org will bite, ya know.) I’ll spare the gory details, but game performance is dependent on graphics performance, graphics performance is heavily depenent on good drivers, drivers are dependent on the kernel, and Linux kernel developers and graphics card vendors have been at an impasse for _years_. It’s just not happening without major amounts of money to grease the wheels.

 1. The point is to avoid the dependency to apt or any other package system.

 2. Library dependencies are dealt with by doing static linking. Kernel dependencies are solved by sticking to POSIX.

 3. The FSF has nothing to do with Steam or Valve.

 4. Proof?

 5. Only Valve has the relevant information to make that call, regarding performance.

 6. WTF are you talking about? Are you claiming that performance is only dependent on drivers and kernel code? LOL.

 update itself. The lack of proper package management is what I hate most about windows.

This could be the catalyst for unraveling all those catch-22s that make desktop Linux less appealing than it could be. Hearing about the cooperation with driver devs is even more exciting.

I admit I’ve never been a fan of Steam itself; given that package management is par for the course on Linux, Steam’s only novelty is as a DRM middleman. (A necessary evil, I understand, but a source of constant mild discomfort nonetheless.) So I’d appreciate anything you guys could do to make Steam more invisible: perhaps give me a minimal daemon configured by /etc/steamd.conf that auths and updates and nothing else.

I’ve only dabbled in game development myself, but I’ve seen more than one highish-profile developer gripe that game development for Linux is difficult because it’s basically uncharted territory. In that light, it would surely be a great boon to the platform if you could take the time to write in-depth technical posts about your experiences; you’re blazing a trail here, so might as well make a map as you go. ![Image 265: :)](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) Someone’s eventually gotta port the rest of the Steam catalog, right?

1161.   Raul says: [July 20, 2012 at 7:38 pm](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/#comment-3173) People is talking about using distro repositories. I’d say better use Google’s Chrome approximation. An extra repository added by a package automatically and after the independent package installation, just update from the repository.

 Once you got the infrastructure for autobuilding packages for Red Hat/Fedora/Suse/Debian/Ubuntu/Gentoo/Arch you can go with one source code. Normally the changes consist of different default directories and maybe some availability of libraries and its versions.

This way you make it much easier for end users. Working on open source drivers is also a must. It gives you better knowledge of what’s happening there, and at the end it will be a more robust software than closed drivers. And who knows, maybe the companies which make the hardware finally decide to collaborate too. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3173#respond)

1165.   Alex says: [July 21, 2012 at 12:23 am](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/#comment-3190) Dear Valve Linux Team,

I really appreciate your efforts to bring more prime titles to the Linux platform. However I have two concerns and one question:

1. Left 4 Dead 2 is a nice game, however I suspect that a lot of people already own it for PC or console. Do we need to buy another license when we want to play it on Linux? You see a lot of people already paid for it, and I hope you are aware of the fact that selling an “old” game on a new platform does mean that it could be that your expectations regarding the number of sold copies should be realistic. There are people who’d buy it twice, but these will be the minority I think.

2. Concentrating on one Distro is a fair choice. Chosing Ubunutu is quite understandble because a lot of people run Ubuntu. And chances are good that Steam will run instantly on a lot of distributions that are debian based as Ubuntu is, if you get it right. I just hope you will get Steam running in a way that is not chained to Ubuntu and does not require any sort of desktop integration – for instance you need a distinct window manager version to run it at all.

So my question is: Will there be any command line interface for steam? If yes there will be no more concerns regarding point 2. ![Image 267: ;)](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif) [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3190#respond)

Of course I imagine with SteamPlay that won’t be the case ![Image 268: :P](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_razz.gif)

I think Valve should make a console with the power of the PS3 or Xbox 360. This console should also be a good Linux box. People with the money for a high end computer can afford a separate system, and a Windows license. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3193#respond)

Personally, I’ve been giving up on using Ubuntu in favor of native Debian, though.

 Ubuntu is based on Debian, but it has changed a lot under the hood – too much Windows-style ego trips for my taste.

If you really must start with Ubuntu, I really hope you focus your efforts to desktops based on Xorg, not on Ubuntu’s Google-Unity thingy.

 Otherwise, the work put into Unity support would not help very much for porting the Steam client to rest of the world’s distro’s, in the next (hopefully soon occuring) step which mainly use Xorg.

Hopefully, no one plans to force everybody using Ubuntu & Unity in the future, just for the sake of gaming. That would counter-act the spirit of diversity in open source software.

 I don’t want to go back to Ubuntu for gaming, now that I’ve been using Debian this long –

 I might as well stick to my dual-booting XP for the time being. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3204#respond)

Luis Fernando says: [July 22, 2012 at 9:08 am](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/#comment-3252) As GNU / Linux user and a addicted gamer, Steam on Linux would be the sweetiest dream in all my lifes. No more wineing Steam on my PC. No more wasting hours determining all configs I need to run a specific game. But as Slackware user I found this Ubuntu thing disturbing. No complaints about Ubuntu, it’s a great distro which popularized GNU / Linux around the world, but we who don’t use Debian-like distros may be caught in some kind of trouble.

 Biggest of all, repositories. We know some distros have better repositories updates than others, and Slackware is one of the worsts among the big distros. Solution: Steam should create a ftp site where they put most recent version of app where we could just download and update our clients. But it will simpler just put the source on this ftp than uploading a lot of different kinds of package – and that’s the question: will Steam share the source code for home compilation? Ten bucks answer will be “no”. Don’t talk about .run executables, they don’t generate a package, so managing them will be as hard as manage “./configure && make && install” installations.

 So, I’d prefer to wait to see this thing working before I cheer it. There is much boasting in GNU / Linux world, and no-nonsense attitude the Man (i.e., Pat Volkerding) has teached me with his Slackware tells me it’s better to wait.

 Something like lib dependency check.

 it could also detect your hardware and recommend the proprietary or otherwise free driver (which performs better).

 You can also count on us, the linux community.

 Games changed the world of Computers in the last few decades, made them actually what they are now.

 Linux with his diversity and ability to adapt in new situations will bring games to a whole new level. Ubuntu is also a great choice.

 Soon and with good marketing you will make millions of people happy to use linux.

Thanks and we will be with you. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3289#respond)

Linux est utiliser dans le secteur professionnel depuis longtemps et ce n’est pas pour rien. Il est temps de le faire passé dans le monde du public. La principal raison de l’invisibilité de Linux est le manque de financement(bien sur Open source pour la philosophie). Mais Le choix d’un OS Open-source et gratuit est le choix de l’utiliateur, mais c’est aussi le choix de chaque utilisateur de bien vouloir payer 60$ pour un jeux Valve natif sur Linux sans etre obliger de payer l’OS. Si le public apprend qu’ils existe un OS gratuit et sans virus avec des jeux professionnels, ils se ruront dessus. C’est là que les profits commencerons réellement. Vient la question des fabriquants de carte graphique, eux aussi devront y mettre leur part du travail, mais peut-etre est-ce que votre initiative donnera gout aux autres de se lancé aussi?

Thanks for exploring the niche of GNU/Linux! As I [wrote in my blog back in 2009](http://www.humans-enabled.com/2009/01/open-letter-to-game-makers-please.html), I truly believe **we are set to see the glory of the GNU/Linux operating system take hold as the prominently used end user platform for computers everywhere**. To me, there are some key points to consider when supporting Linux: 1.) GNU/Linux marketshare should not be measured in the same way the other systems are measured.. namely because there are no sales numbers to show installs, and there can be bias from certain “web stat” counters, and 2.) Showing support for GNU/Linux is like the shining badge of good corporate citizenship in my opinion – especially when you give back to the system in some way. To me, I think Valve could help to enhance the 3d gaming graphics capabilities of GNU/Linux (3d gaming is definitely already a very strong suite of the system, it’s just a matter of helping glue things all together better for the platform). Thanks for helping us all get the most out of technology and GNU/Linux! Also, if you are looking for beta testers – We’d be delighted to help test the games.

This means if you guys are working on a linux version of steam, then the community will surely help you. Don’t stop them, don’t block them, help them and open your program to them. It’s not the traditional “we got the code and no one will look at it”. if you do that, you will succeed. Most game company I know tried linux and because they used their traditional views on their games it didn’t work. The games wouldn’t work correctly and since they blocked help and the community the project went down and closed eventually.

I, like many have said, think this is the start of a revolution in which Windows is dethroned as the PC gaming platform of choice and GNU + Linux (RMS, are you happy?) rises up to take its place. I hope other companies follow suit. I am very excited to hear this, and I hope HL2 and episodes are soon available in Steam Linux.

Now, please forgive my noobness. I have used Windows since 3.1, and from time to time I have been peeking at Ubuntu ever since 7.04. I have read some Linux users think it is a bad idea to have Steam update the client and the games automatically, which is how it does it in Windows and OSX. For some, if not all Valve game saves, Steam uses a cloud, so if you play in one computer, you can continue in another, even using a friend’s computer.

Could you please explain why the auto-update is a bad idea in Linux? And, would the cloud game save work in Linux?. Do you think that is also a bad idea?

Valve, you guys are awesome, I will most likely buy Portal 2 and see how it works in Linux (OK! OK! GNU + LINUX!. I hope they recover your stolen computer RMS, seriously!)

 “I have read some Linux users think it is a bad idea to have Steam update the client and the games automatically, which is how it does it in Windows and OSX.”

I also think it’s a bad idea to update the client automatically. In GNU+Linux the user controls the system, not the other way. Client updates should go with the rest of the package management, for better integration and version control of both the client and the libraries it uses. Having auto updates means that the client must be installed in the user’s directory, and without root permissions. Also, if you want to use MAC (Mandatory Access Control) software like SELinux or AppArmor, you already need root permisios for updating the profiles whenever a new game is installed.

The only things I could see desirable to be in the user’s directory are games or SDKs. In that way the user can install mods without extra permissions. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3374#respond)

People unfamiliar with Linux might interpret your answer as obstinate or stubborn, opinion which I am sure Linux guys do not care about. I sure would not.

Not being very proficient in Linux I understand your answer as being “It is a bad idea because it is not how things should be; everything must be controlled by the user, everything must follow procedure”, which I can reason is a valid statement if it is the Linux way, though I would not mind bequeathing some mundane responsibilities to automated processes. But, are there any risks in doing so? Security risks maybe? If Valve was to do that, would it be a huge issue?

In the end I do not passionately care how Steam is updated; I was just curious to find out why the auto update was a bad idea.

Thanks.

    *   Antoine says: [July 24, 2012 at 3:22 pm](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/#comment-3382) Auto-update means that you let a program act on his own and without any special permission(it’s in the user space). As long as what you’re updating truly is steam then that wouldn’t be a great problem security wise. Now, the problem is if a virus were to imitate steam for exemple(simply, it could be a modified client of steam), then it would be able to go and download/execute anything it wants and you probably wouldn’t see anything before it was too late. Of course, it wouldn’t be able to obtain root access but it could mess with everything that is in the normal user’s power(in other word, all your personal data…). So yes, that definitely IS dangerous, maybe not at an absurd level, but you shouldn’t neglect it either. And yes, linux isn’t invulnerable, so it’s better to refrain from doing dangerous things even there.

The other problem is that it is just very very messy, you would have one program updating itself at a certain rythm and the rest of the OS at another one. It could lead to problem with dependencies if one or the other goes too fast. Whereas with a package manager, everything is upgraded together, if a package needs its dependencies to be upgraded then they will and conversly, if an uprade in dependencies were to break the program then the upgrade wouldn’t be made or the package would be rebuilt by mainteners so that it works with new librairies version.

In hope that it helps you,

 As Antoine says, if you have the Steam client updated through the package manager, it handles automatically all the libraries and software needed for Steam to be executed.

 It’s not stubborness. It’s just system tidiness and higiene. The games could be also downloaded as separate packages and have a post-installation script modifying permissions and owner in the $HOME directory of the user so the files end with the user as propietary in order to he being available of doing mods.

Currently, GNU+Linux systems use very often the package manager, and the users just get used to it, because it’s very simple and effective, managing all the installed software and it’s updates with their account’s password, and then they can remove the software with just one click, and cleanly.

As a Linux only user (no dual boot for me), I have been playing Steam games under Wine for quite a while now, but being able to run a native client and native ports of the games on Steam would save us so much hassle, not to mention open up all the good stuff that doesn’t react kindly to the Wine environment.

No more wondering if this game might actually work with Wine, no more tweaking for hours if it doesn’t.

Firstly this makes it very distro specific, thus adding to the complexity of getting it working on all distro’s. But more importantly, the games I have that are installed via Apt are a real pain when they are updated. I update often and the updates are never more than a few MB and take a few seconds to run. The minute Oil Rush or something similar gets an update the size of the update is massive. The update manager then takes an hour to run, takes a lot of system resources whilst its running and prevents me from installing anything else until its done!

I do need my OS to be as up to date as possible, but I don’t need that for my games so I’d rather keep the two processes seperate. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3482#respond)

The harddrive in my windows computer died, and I couldn’t find my windows cd, so now I have two computers that run linux (I would have bought a new windows cd, but I’m in college and close to broke). The only thing I have missed from not having a windows computer has been the ability to play games (WINE has worked less than optimally).

I’m primarily using Gentoo, and if I can hop onto Steam without having to reboot into Windows you can expect a ton more purchases from me.

Not only that, but having more games use native OpenGL on Linux will force AMD/ATI and Nvidia to finally step up their graphics drivers.

 Now i have a computer just for gaming running win 7 (wast of good hardware)and a laptop with Ubuntu for my stuff.

 My 5 year old kid has an user account user on my Ubuntu laptop, he does his login and surfs the web (youtube) and plays some online games all this in a Ubuntu machine and

 it was very easy for him to learn how to work with Ubuntu.

 I play CS since 1.5 until now i am waiting for the new release i hope you manage to have many games in the Linux client of steam.

 This will be just a small beginning but it will be big revolution for all gamers and developers.

 You have a Alfa/Beta tester here please do release something for the community to test and give feedback . [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3569#respond)

Also note that I’ve never spent a penny on Steam or Valve games, at least not money you guys ever see… but this will change. On day one (assuming I’ve reinstalled Ubuntu by then), I will be purchasing most everything you release native clients for. Left for Dead and Serious Sam 3 are two that I’m looking very forward to! Hoping CS:S and it’s sequels as well as Portal get ported over too.

Please Please Please :

* Allow me to run a dedicated server on my plain Debian server (possibly Arch Linux when i have to update) by deploying a self contained executable. Also please please don’t make me have to mod the shit out of a game server to get this to happen. I’ll still buy your stuff, but I’ll be investing far more time than I’de like too.

* Do not require that I have to be online for single-player

* Let me play LAN matches unobstructed

* Release early, release often. Despite Ubuntu’s model, many of us still like updates more than twice a year. I know your game clients won’t be following this model, but i want to ensure nothing else does.

* Go distro agnostic eventually. It’s not hard, in-fact it is very easy. Most every distro’s mailing list will give you any tips you need. Gaming started for geeks and many of us have become super geeks who don’t like n00b friendly bloatware. Sure I *may* be able to modify your release to run on Arch, but it’s nice when there is multi distro support. Include all your own libraries if you have too, despite my hate for bloatware, and especially proprietary bloatware, in my mind Steam on Linux is an exception. That being said, open source your client. No one is going to jump clients because you free up the code, but it will making packaging it for other distros/platforms something the users will want to do (and you’ll see some patches from this as well).

In my mind I was complaining about other wordy posts, but I think I’m just excited like everyone else here! You guys rock!!!

EFruit says: [July 29, 2012 at 3:43 pm](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/#comment-3644) I’m glad to finally hear that Steam is going to Linux, but I don’t know how well it would actually work out. I mean _really_. Linux is popular with developers and server admins, the two major categories of users who know what they’re doing. I just have to beg the question, If there even _is_ any substantial demographic of people who

 1: Know what Steam is

 2: Like Steam

 3: Can use or would like to use Linux

 (IMO the most important) 4: Will put proprietary software on their Linux boxes (The most different thing about Linux is that you can actually get the code for it and change it), why would Valve spend time and money to appease that tiny demographic? And why would Valve go to an _open source_ OS when they’re not supportive of open source, and in fact are somewhat against it (All software is proprietary and I’ve seen no product of any effort to change that, Steam Subscriber Agreement prohibits sharing of any Source mod’s source).

But then again,

~~Towering Pillar of ~~**TINFOIL** HAT MODE ACTIVATE

 Maybe Valve will take the Desura route and bring the client open source. I’d really like that, but it wouldn’t be popular with publishers and developers.

 I’d ADORE an open source Steam Community. I feel that FOSS is the way to go, but there are some things where there are just no FOSS alternatives. Steam and Source games are both in that category. Sure Desura is on Linux, but I’d like to see you purchase Team Fortress 2 on Desura. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3644#respond)

 I don’t use Linux because its free, but because its the best tool for the job.

 It’s unfortunate that Linux users are often painted as foaming mouthed OSS ‘freetard zealots’ because we’re not. Hopefully the success of Steam will prove that. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3736#respond)

Really, does like someone with a ‘do it right’ attude needs to come in and reshape PC gaming, or gaming in general for that matter.

At the moment seems like platform holders have too much control in console space. Restrictive, demands, pricing, pay to use multiplayer components etc. PC space is dominated by expensive OS upgrades, DRM, hardware compatibility and piracy.

Hopefully linux steam is the first, big step, towards a valve unifed console – more freedom for developers, piracy free (thus DRM free). Basics like cloud saves, achievements, leaderboards etc available in the SDK. Maybe a Valve OS will be the first step (installable distro based upon an existing linux flavor) before taking the plunge to a new hardware platform.

Does introduce some interesting questions – how will they deal with system vs user installed libs for games – will things be static linked or dynamic. Which distro will be picked long term (personally I’m sort of between Fedora and Arch, like the dynamic link nature of both, and more so of late Fedoras acceptance of newer linux tech like Systemd etc).

I am using Fuduntu (was forked from Fedora) atm and I am looking forward for a .rpm of Steam, but to support the number of the user base I will install steam in a Ubuntu VM or maybe I will use it in dual boot at the beginning =)

Funny thing is, several days ago I heard two college students on the train talking about PC’s and software, then one of them mentioned that steam will be ported to Linux and the other one was all like “Ow wow, games are the only thing binding me to windows”. I think a lot of people are thinking the same way.

 Also spread the word because a lot of gamers may not know about the Linux port of Steam yet.

Linux is a great platform and once Steam ports onto Linux, more great things will follow. Many great companies complain that Linux doesn’t have a market (i’m looking at you Adobe Photoshop), but really, with Ubuntu there now is a market. I really don’t see why anyone wants to stick around on Windows, because really, the Windows 8 is horrid and the concept of Windows being made for PC’s is really deceptive and completely not true with the Windows 8. Driver problems and other difficulties arise with Windows not with Linux distros like Ubuntu. You get access to repositories and cherry-pick what you need and like without bloat and really a new user coming on Linux will find it easier to use then Windows… Instead of going through half the internet to find the .exe you need you can just type two simple commands in the terminal or use software manager and get everything going with ease.

 It’s great not only because we’ll have our favorite games run on Linux natively, but also because now many game developers will understand that Linux-users are also important.

 I use Linux on all my machines, and I was so much suffering that only several games can be run on Linux+Wine without a great amount of shaman dances. I hope that now the new era will begin, the era when no one will say “Oh, I don’t know, I see, Linux is cool, but all video games I love… None will run well… I better stay on Windows, though I don’t like it.”

This keeps most people from using desktop OS as servers. 32 bit Linux almost always has PAE enabled, except for builds for older chipsets that cannot do PAE.

Also, the “free” he’s using in this text is *NOT* the opposite of *paid-for*. *Libre* software can be used to make money, and Stallman does not oppose to this idea at all.

The confusion between “Free” as in “Gratuit” and “Free” as in “Libre” is due to the nature of the English language only. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3802#respond)

You might as well make your product available to more users, particularly users that are running an operating system that is bringing us into the future. Valve should also join the Linux Foundation if it wants more support from Linux developers. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=3808#respond)

If Valve did nothing more than released Steam, L4D2 and their other popular games for Linux *and* created a reference HTPC standard for Linux then how many inexpensive Chinese manufacturers would create HTPCs based on that platform? Why stop at games? You might as well extend this model to video and audio distribution.

At that point the hell with XBox, PS3, Win8, Mac Store. Maybe Android would survive.

XBMSteam HTPC.

Rock and Roll Valve! You have nothing to lose with Win8 store being mandatory and OSX Mac Store on the other side. The mobile gaming market is Mac store and Android Play.

Nothing to lose.

Dusty says: [August 4, 2012 at 4:40 am](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/#comment-4710) ohh, over fifteen years ago I suggsted in conversation that Game Developers should get together to develop an open source “Game Operating System”. At the time, my thinking was that using Windows to run games was overkill and that a dedicatd GOS could take up less space and run much faster. Perhaps at last something like this is finally going to happen thanks to Valves efforts (even if it is for different reasons)

Incidentally this could become something of a microsoft death zone! I am sure that I am not alone in only having Win on my system to play games (all my web usage and work related activities would run as well if not better using Ubuntu etc) Something like this could seriouly damage Microsofts traditional home market unless the win8/tablets market can grow fast enough to compensate for the loss of market share (and why should it?)

Scorpion says: [August 6, 2012 at 8:34 am](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/#comment-4885) Just a question… does the enviroment (unity, gnome-shell, kde, etc) has any significant impact on the performance when running the game??? [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=4885#respond)  
    *   Valve Linux team says: [August 7, 2012 at 1:02 pm](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/#comment-4985) We haven’t noticed any significant differences based on desktop environments but we are still in the development stage. When we enter testing we’ll focus more on desktop environments and their impact. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/steamd-penguins/?replytocom=4985#respond)

The Valve Linux Team

Our mission is to strengthen the gaming scene on Linux, both for players and developers. This includes Linux ports of Steam and Valve games, as well as partner games. We are also investigating open source initiatives that could benefit the community and game developers.

Initially formed in 2011, the Valve Linux team is currently 11 people and growing. Our mission is to investigate open source development with a specific focus on supporting Steam and other Valve products on the Linux platform. The Linux background of our team varies from those who have a deep knowledge of Linux development to those who have just scratched the surface. However, one thing we all share is a great passion for supporting all things Valve on Linux. We are currently seeking experienced developers for Mac, Linux (kernel and driver), and OpenGL to fill our team. If you match these qualifications, please let us [know](mailto:valvelinuxteam@valvesoftware.com).
