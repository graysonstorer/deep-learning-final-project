**Steam has added a new ‘item store’ feature.**Now, in addition to the player-driven [community market](https://steamcommunity.com/market/), developers can [run their own stores](http://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/252490/) (where they set their own fixed prices). _Rust_ is the first game to take advantage, and they’re undercutting some community prices. Hmmm. I’m interested to see how this shakes out.

Zero effort for Valve but tons of sources of new income for them.

Seriously, it’s like every new addition to Steam is just another half asses money making scheme by Valve.

What could possibly go wrong with a developer controlled market. Hmmm!

The only thing I buy/sell in the market are the trading cards, mainly because I like having the shiny (ooo shiny) badge, so I buy what I need and sell my duplicates (from booster packs).

I’m curious as to how it’ll play out, and whether it’ll stick around or go the way of paid mods.
