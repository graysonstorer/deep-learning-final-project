Garry's Mod Breaks 1 Million Sold, First Peek At Sales Chart
============================================================

Jul 27, 2011 at 12:52 AM - [OhmWrecker](mailto:news@ve3d.com?subject=News%20Submission) - [![Image 5: A 15x11 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](http://oystatic.ignimgs.com/src/ve3d/sites/ve3d.ign.com/img/default/comment_icon.gif) 5 Comments](http://ve3d.ign.com/articles/news/61425/Garrys-Mod-Breaks-1-Million-Sold-First-Peek-At-Sales-Chart#comments) Up until today the developers who sell their products on Steam have always been tight lipped on data relating to units sold. Some say that it's due to a contractual obligation with Valve not to release the data in the first place. Whether true or not after breaking the one million units sold milestone the team behind Garry's Mod said screw that noise, and dumped the chart below for the world to see. 

[![Image 6: A dark-themed waveform display shows audio amplitude with peaks](http://oyster.ignimgs.com/ve3d/thumbs/08/39/83943_thumb.jpg)](http://ve3d.ign.com/images/83943/PC/Garrys-Mod)

If you're wondering what spikes are from, look no further than [SteamGameSales.com](http://www.steamgamesales.com/view-history.php?id=710) which clearly highlights four of the most recent Garry's Mod sales going back to February 2010. It's interesting that during some of the sales events Garry's Mod went on to sell as many or even more than the number sold when the product first launched.

Same here. When Steam had their "Summer Camp" sales going on, I bought quite a few games and didn't pay much!

It's proof that games are over-priced and piracy is fed by trying to hold the price too high for what a game is offering.

The success of a mod of a sequal of a mod, sold on the original modders distribution system.

 More reasons why mod support should take priority over paid DLC. Making things a closed shop kills innovation. Today's modders often become the next generation of software market leaders.

 Well done and congratulations to the Gary's Mod team! My children love you!
