Valve is taking Steam’s movie, and videos section offline.

The company announced the news today with [a brief message](https://store.steampowered.com/news/48501/), and the Video tab is no longer available in the store.

After a successful run with gaming-related videos, such as documentaries and making-ofs, Steam decided to get into the business of selling movies, TV shows and content you don’t generally associate with the platform. Devolver Digital’s [indie film library](https://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=Devolver%20Digital%20Films), for instance, was available on Steam, as were TV shows like Alan Tudyk’s Con Man.

Now, Valve is moving away from this expansion to refocus Steam Video on gaming-related content. “In reviewing what Steam users actually watch, it became clear we should focus our effort on offering content that is either directly related to gaming or, is accessory content for games or software sold on Steam,” the blog post reads.

You can still find existing content using search, and videos associated with games will continue to be listed on their store pages, and library entries. Additionally, any content you currently own will continue to be available for download.

Expect non-gaming videos to slowly get removed from the store in the coming weeks.
