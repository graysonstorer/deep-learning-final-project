Steam Family Options Now Out of Beta
====================================

Share.

 Users now have the option to control what features and content their kids can access. 

By [Lucy O'Brien](http://people.ign.com/Luce_IGN_AU)Steam's Family Options are now out of its beta period, allowing parents or guardians to start setting limitations on their children's Steam accounts.

Enabling Family Options is fairly simple, according to the [announcement details](http://steamcommunity.com/groups/familyoptions#announcements/detail/1891810256974531037) on the Steam Community website. Parents can now log into their kids account and select the option via settings, which enables them to select the content and features they'd like their children to be able to access (or not access) while in a PIN-protected 'Family View.'

In the announcement, Valve emphasized they"understand every family has its own approach to establishing rules and setting limits when it comes to media, entertainment, and games," and "hope most families talk through these issues together and find ways to agree on what’s realistic and fair."![Image 4: IGN Logo](http://oystatic.ignimgs.com/src/core/img/widgets/global/page/globhead_dpad_red.png)
