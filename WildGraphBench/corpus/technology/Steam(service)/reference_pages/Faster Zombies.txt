Posted on[August 1, 2012](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/ "2:10 pm")by[Valve Linux team](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/author/frankc/ "View all posts by Valve Linux team")

One factor in creating a good gaming experience is throughput. This post discusses some of what we’ve learned about the performance of our games running on Linux.

 As any software developer can tell you, performance is a complicated issue. In the interests of simplicity, we’ll concern ourselves with the following high-end configuration:

**Hardware**

*   Intel Core i7 3930k
*   NVIDIA GeForce GTX 680
*   32 GB RAM

**Software**

*   Windows 7 Service Pack 1 64-bit
*   Left 4 Dead 2
*   Ubuntu 12.04 32-bit

We are using a 32-bit version of Linux temporarily and will run on 64-bit Linux later.

 Running Left 4 Dead 2 on Windows 7 with Direct3D drivers, we get 270.6 FPS as a baseline. The data is generated from an internal test case.

When we started with Linux, the initial version we got up and running was at 6 FPS.This is typical of an initial successful port to a new platform.

 Performance improvements fall into several categories:

*   Modifying our game to work better with the kernel
*   Modifying our game to work better with OpenGL
*   Optimizing the graphics driver

An example of the first category would be changing our memory allocator to use more appropriate Linux functions. This was achieved by implementing the Source engine small block heap to work under Linux. The second category would include reducing overhead in calling OpenGL, and extending our renderer with new interfaces for better encapsulation of OpenGL and Direct3D.

 The third category is especially interesting because it involves working with hardware manufacturers to identify issues in their drivers and, as a result, improving the public driver which benefits all games.Identifying driver stalls and adding multithreading support in the driver are two examples of changes that were the result of this teamwork.

 After this work, Left 4 Dead 2 is running at 315 FPS on Linux. That the Linux version runs faster than the Windows version (270.6)seems a little counter-intuitive,given the greater amount of time we have spent on the Windows version. However, it does speak to the underlying efficiency of the kernel and OpenGL.Interestingly, in the process of working with hardware vendors we also sped up the OpenGL implementation on Windows. Left 4 Dead 2 is now running at 303.4 FPS with that configuration.

OpenGL versus Direct3D on Windows 7
-----------------------------------

This experience lead to the question: why does an OpenGL version of our game run faster than Direct3D on Windows 7? It appears that it’s not related to multitasking overhead.We have been doing some fairly close analysis and it comes down to a few additional microseconds overhead per batch in Direct3D which does not affect OpenGL on Windows. Now that we know the hardware is capable of more performance, we will go back and figure out how to mitigate this effect under Direct3D.

Working with hardware vendors
-----------------------------

We’ve been working with NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel to improve graphic driver performance on Linux.They have all been great to work with and have been very committed to having engineers on-site working with our engineers, carefully analyzing the data we see.We have had very rapid turnaround on any bugs we find and it has been invaluable to have people who understand the game, the renderer, the driver, and the hardware working alongside us when attacking these performance issues.

 This is a great example of the benefits that are the result of close coordination between software and hardware developers and should provide value to the Linux community at large.

So basically, I’d love to see any discussion on whether Intel is a viable option for gaming on Linux, so that you don’t need to mess around with binary-only display drivers.

Also, if you have any feedback to the AMD open-source team or the community that do the Noveau driver I’m sure they’d love to hear from you ![Image 5: :)](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=3826#respond)

 Ivy Bridge’s HD4000 is almost usable in terms of performance if it’s not thermal\power constrained to 17 W. It has 16 execution units.

 Next year’s core – Haswell will have 40 execution units in it’s best bin. It’s 2,5 faster even if they not gonna change anything in shaders, which is unlikely. Plus 64 MB of on-package memory to deal with bandwidth problem.

 With that performance and official open-source driver Intel will be the best choice for gaming in Linux next year, at least in notebooks. For desktops though discrete card + binary will give you better performance of course. Reverse-engineered open source drivers is no good for gaming (or power management and many other things), so if you want oss driver intel is your best bet.

Open-source drivers for Intel may make the game playable, but would anyone really take the gratification of using an open-source driver even if it meant awful performance compared to just installing the proprietary driver from NVIDIA or AMD?

Also, I know what you meant about the open-source driver being great in notebooks and what not, but you shouldn’t overlook the A8 and A10 APUs. Those things are little powerhouses and, more often than not, outperform anything Intel can bring to the “integrated GPU” table. I think once this all happens, if I find myself wanting a meager, power-wise laptop that can play games at minimal or decent settings, I’ll be getting one with a nice A10 Trinity APU.

I you’d want to play a movie connected to more than two speakers, though, AMD is certainly not what you want in a linux powered machine today.

I also generally find their binary drivers lacking compared to nivida ones, although that i supposed to have bettered in recent years. Seeing as AMD at least publish spec and other details you need to mak a proper driver, I till kind of hope we’ll get a decent opensource AMD GPU-driver someday.

The Intel driver as such has a pretty good reputation. The difference is in the hardware, a HD4000 is significantly weaker than a discrete GPU from NVIDIA or AMD.

But depending on the game, it may be enough. In a review two years ago, its predecessor, the HD3000, was compared to an aging NVidia 8600 GT and came out with similar performance. And I can confirm that the 8600 GT will do fine for games from a few years ago ![Image 6: :)](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=4877#respond)

But radeon is not a reverse engineered driver. AMD releases specifications for their graphics cards. Unfortunately they sometimes seem to have a hard time with legal review and so it’s not always enaugh.

They also have five employees working full time on the open driver.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_hardware_and_FOSS#ATI.2FAMD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_hardware_and_FOSS#ATI.2FAMD)

I wouldn’t bet about next year’s “best for gaming” yet, not even for notebooks. The radeonsi is not in a very good state yet but in one year, much can happen. I think I will be buying a notebook with a HD 7970M in the next few weeks/months and I don’t see intel speeding up their graphics so much that it can come close anywhere near to that card in only one year. The strongest reason would be that they probably don’t want to eat as much power in their integrated graphics for thermal reasons alone.

            *   Aaron says: [August 2, 2012 at 1:17 pm](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/#comment-4279) The FOSS AMD driver as of yet is usable for most things, but generally not desirable for gaming, you’ll get playable framerates in some less-graphically-intense games, but it’s stuck at a little over half the performance of the binary blob; If AMD were to take it more seriously it would be much better off.

also, the FOSS driver doesn’t yet have stable support for Radeon HD 7000 cards because the architecture change was quite drastic, and the AMD FOSS driver team is understaffed.

I’d like to see AMD take it more seriously, but that seems to be a tad wishful; For now I choose intel graphics for everything I do. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=4279#respond)

The nvidia driver is src.

Thats the problem not the driver.   

            *   Hans says: [August 2, 2012 at 1:58 pm](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/#comment-4299) The AMD OSS driver is mostly usable, but it lacks in some areas; namely power management (or rather dynamic reclocking doesn’t work flawlessly yet), video acceleration (using the special purpose hardware bits, I think people are working on getting things accelerated using the 3D/compute engine).

Performance is getting better but isn’t quite there yet. I can barely play Minecraft on my Radeon 5850 for example. I’m currently suffering from X crashing occasionally when playing videos and DPMS doesn’t work with my monitor (it’ll just endlessly wake-up, go to sleep, wake-up again, and so on). Gnome 3 feels a bit sluggish with the OSS driver, and it gets slower over time for some reason, so I tend to have to restart X a lot. Enabling my second monitor or playing a video also makes Gnome 3 even more sluggish

These are anecdotal experiences of course, but I seem to have mostly the same issues with my 4850 in a different PC currently. ![Image 7: :|](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_neutral.gif)

Overall though the driver has made solid progress over the past few years and I think OpenGL 3.x support is almost done. So I’m confident they’ll get there, I just wish they were able to work faster, but I’m sure it’s hard enough as it is with just a handful of people working on it. The main reason I don’t use the proprietary driver is because I’ve tired dealing with all the X/kernel incompatibilities it has, since I like livin’ on the edge ![Image 8: :D](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_biggrin.gif) [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=4299#respond)

    *   Andrian Nord says: [August 2, 2012 at 3:11 pm](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/#comment-4345) Well, they surely have to support FOSS drivers as well, as, at least, Intel has only FOSS drivers. And recently ATI dropped support of all chipsets below Evergreen (<HD5600 maybe) in their proprietary driver (fglrx), so there is a big slice of not-so-old hardware which is supported only by FOSS drivers.

But, at other hand, AMD and Intel made a great improvements into mesa code, especially into r600g. While they improving Gallium 3D, all FOSS drivers benefits from that, including nouveau (but I'd rather disbelieve that nouveau would be ever rated by anyone as "supported" driver, due to it's unofficial nature).

I was able to run Diablo 3 under wine on r600g with only slightly lower FPS that on fglrx (and, hopefully, without many artifacts game was suffering before), but still, there is much work to do as even fglrx performance was harsh in comparison with proprietary Nvidia drivers on comparable hardware.

And still, FOSS drivers for radeon are unable to provide full software support of hardware features. And it's hard to speak about any modern graphics until OpenGL 3.3 is supported (core profile). Even with consideration of much more agile extension system of OpenGL (in comparsion with DirectX's strict feature set per version) the biggest problem of supporting new version of OpenGL in mesa (FOSS drivers) is new GLSL shading language.

ATI made a new breakthough with their new r600-llvm-compiler, which may eventually make it's way into generic Gallium 3D infrastructure (at least, parts of it), so everyone will benefit. But again, there is still much work to do – it's still not capable of doing at least same amount of job as current TSIG compiler and there is many things to implement before it will be "commercially usable", like optimizations, error handling and soon.

In short, I guess, with Valve's release on Steam and Left4Dead, things will only begun to improve, but I doubt that FOSS drivers will be ready upon release. But, surely, existence of solid platform and raise of interest will give a huge boost to development efforts in mesa, so as more games will emerge from Valve, FOSS drivers will catch up eventually.

I would be really interested in seeing stats from rendering a more complex scene that was around ~60FPS and also comparing CPU and GPU limited scenes since that would minimize overhead/cosmic rays/etc.

Percentage/ratio comparisons are “correct”, but misleading. If a game is running at 5000fps for instance and I can get it to 10000fps, that’s a 2x increase, so a big deal right? In reality I’ve just shaved off 0.1ms… once the game is running at a more reasonable rate, that’s just noise. At 60fps that optimization doesn’t even get me to 61fps…

Problem is, that they are using their own technology stack for all driver components, i.e they are not using “standard” GLX or DRI infrastructure (while ATI’s drivers does).

And intel drivers, which should be used to power internal cards, are strictly FOSS and strictly based on “standard” infrastructure. So they just can’t live along in same process.

Well, some time before, they even couldn’t exists in same kernel at same time (Nvidia drivers where conflicting for resources with FOSS DRM modules), but nowadays that’s fixed (at Nvidia’s side too, BTW). So one problem gone for good, and other just couldn’t be “resolved”.

So, there is bumblebee project, which is, essentially, just second X-server for nvidia card existing espectially for OpenGL rendering purposes. That’s mimics the way of Windows’s realization of Optimus (it’s also software only) and I dare to say, is much better around some corners.

So, actually, I didn’t think that anyone was expecting Nvidia to fork Xorg server (as bumblebee project done) and do this all themselfs.

They done necessary stuff at their side (fixed the kernel modules) and let the community to do the rest. And it works pretty good.

You shouldn’t be expecting any other “official” realization.

And about Trollwards. Well, he is right at some degree – NVidia not supporting FOSS as much as ATI and Intel does, but I guess we will see who’s path was correct at the end of the day (hint: ATI’s ![Image 11: ;-)](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif) ).

You can get it to work with the bumblebee project (on github). It took me a couple days to get everything setup right the first time, but it’s much easier now, especially on distros with ppa support.

install webupd8 ppa for nvidia-current, (google it)

 install bumblebee from repo (there is a script which will supposedly leave mesa alone)

run applications as `optirun chrome` -> now webGL works

In latest builds of chrome you have to bypass their blacklist; they blacklisted all optimus cards, but if you have it setup right through bumblebee, you will have full support for everything.

If anything goes wrong, recommendation is to apt-get install –reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx to make intel work properly, and then just use bumblebee.conf to point to the nvidia drivers (which it does by default).

If intel card still tries to load nvidia modules (check in /var/log/Xorg.0.log), then you have a symlink somewhere still pointing to nvidia. For ubuntu, I had to:

 sudo rm /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions

 sudo ln -s /usr/lib/xorg/modules/extensions /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/xorg/extra-modules

Intel made a fallback to classic infrastructure in their rush for OpenGL 3.0 support, but in process they loss some features support for older hardware, so I guess they will return to Gallium 3D over some time.

Anyway, Gallium is a very nice thing to have, as that’s a good and mature (and becoming even more mature each day) infrastructure for building graphics drivers that will surely attract graphics developers as more graphics vendors (if any) will decide to support Linux as well (if Valve’s plan of making Linux gaming platform will succeed that surely will happen).

        *   Josh Simmons says: [August 2, 2012 at 4:50 pm](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/#comment-4378) The short answer to this is that system memory allocators are tuned for the general case. They have to handle both frequent and infrequent allocation/deallocation of large and small blocks without any serious degenerate cases and without seriously fragmenting the heap. They are tuned for performance yes, but reasonable performance for all kinds of workloads would be a better description.

An application specific allocator (or allocators) knows the patterns it will be dealing with and so it can be tuned with those patterns in mind. This can lead to vast improvements and is why so many applications have have their own special memory subsystems.

Custom allocators can also do things like track memory usage to report errors and provide performance metrics for the application. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=4378#respond)

 Well, if you get 3D acceleration: Just ignore it.

Some driver version 2 or 3 years ago added that warning for unsupported devices.

 At least in my case (HD3870X2) unsupported seems to mean “might work, but we do not guarantee it” and the GPU produces some minor graphical glitches in Gnome3. And I am not even sure if this is Gnomes fault, as everything else works as nice as with my integrated Intel HD3000.

I’ve read recently that there have been many improvements added to trunk versions of Compiz (what Unity runs under) so I’m curious if that’s what you were running on your tests. Historically, Compiz has been a very poor window manager when you need to run OpenGL applications such as Blender, AutoDesk or 3d accelerated video games. Have you guys run into issues with this?

Also coming to mind is “does Valve intend on doing any work with D3D10/11 or OpenGL 4.x in the near future?”

I suppose the xbox is basically the only reason to support D3D (that I can see), perhaps a wrapper like gldirect would be more economical?

It would definitely be a performance hit, but judging the the comparative performance of wines D3D wrapper, probably not that much of one, and it would certainly be easier to translate the open source calls into the closed api then trying to convert D3D into opengl, without good documentation of the D3D calls.

However this can be resolved like in the Windows by checking the xorg version and installing the appropriate driver if necessary.

In the Linux case I still think this should handled by the distro’s package manager, some of them do it already like Ubuntu if you chose to install the binary drivers it also keeps it update if I’m not mistaken.

As an important client, you should encourage AMD and especially Nvidia to collaborate more with the open sourced driver developers to benefit the maximum number of potential customers. Considering that open drivers are used by default in many Linux distros and they tend to be more compatible with the latest Linux packages, focusing on the open drivers will lead to a better experience on Linux, which would pull in potential customers.

Ideally, there should be no closed drivers and GPU manufacturers should work on the open drivers full-time. Not because closed software is evil, but because it would be easier to maintain and provide a better experience for the end users. Instead of splitting peoples efforts, they could be pooled together and interested vendors like yourselves would find it easier to contribute.

 But I highly disagree with you when it comes to the open source (at least ATI) drivers: my opinion is that they are in a shape which at least makes it possible to play games with them. I use the latest stable radeon driver here (6.14) together with Mesa 8.0.4 and Gallium enabled ant I can play the following games:

 - Unreal Tournament 2004 + 99 (native)

 - Xonotic (native)

 - Neverwinter Nights (Native)

 - Amnesia (native)

 - Call of Duty 4 (wine)

 - Dragon Age 2 (wine, did not work with the proprietary drivers when I tested it directly after release)

I have even made the observation that the open source radeon drivers work better together with wine than the closed source fglrx drivers. Also the support of ATI is really, really bad – they most of the time don’t even support the latest stable Xorg version and bug reports are more or less ignored.

The only drawback that I have with the open source drivers is the power management (which just works manually on my 4870, but it works and my card is silent if I want it to be)

So at least here I’m really happy with the open source drivers even (or especially) when it comes to gaming. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=3945#respond)

That’s not to say Xorg is bad, it’s quite remarkable what they’ve been able to do with a really old protocol, but the signs point to it nearing the end of its life.

In terms of 3d gaming, neither the X server nor Wayland is involved in the bulk of the work: mainly, the application uses the 3d libraries (mesa) which talk to the graphics card drivers, and render a frame which is then stored in the video card memory. Where X/Wayland come in is in getting that frame to be displayed. Both (modern) X and Wayland do this in the same way: they update a pointer that says what video memory the card should output, and set it to the location of the frame. This process takes essentially no time.

(This has assumed that the application you’re running is full screen. If it’s not, X or the X compositor, or the Wayland compositor, has to do one copy of the buffer to place it in the final image.)

With all that said, I am very interested to know how X-specific the code is and whether it will be ported to Wayland in the near future. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=4242#respond)  
        *   Josh Simmons says: [August 2, 2012 at 4:40 pm](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/#comment-4375) The problem with supporting this kind of application on Wayland is that you’re really going to have to wait for AMD and nVidia to port their drivers to the new architecture (if they even do it). OpenGL support is still sub-par in Mesa and 3D performance in the open source drivers still leaves a lot to be desired.

Native OpenGL in Wayland too is limited to the GLES variants since supporting full OpenGL would require bringing in GLX which is of course tied strongly to Xorg (Wayland uses egl currently to bring up an OpenGL context).

As far as any porting to Wayland goes windowing and context creation is a relatively simple bit of code so the port wouldn’t be overly involved, I’m not sure what the input story looks like under Wayland but I wouldn’t expect that to raise any serious issues either by the time any porting might happen.

But for now considering all this and that Wayland is still a way off shipping en-mass means that we’re likely to be using Xorg for a while yet. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=4375#respond)

Wayland is a very young project, and will not meaningfully displace Xorg for many years. Additionally, the speed at which it’s adopted will depend totally on the strength of its support for the X11 protocol.

Lastly, as others have explained, the areas in which it improves performance are not relevant to anything we know about video game technology at present. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=4283#respond)

Windows 64-bit is a mixed 32-bit and 64-bit runtime environment. Source games run as 32-bit non-native executables under 64-bit Windows.

Porting software to native 64-bit is often error prone, and i understand, if Valve are to undertake it, that this effort may not be complete yet. Running 32-bit software under 64-bit linux is possible, but often difficult because of issues with mixed runtime support, which i think is incomplete in Debian (and Ubuntu) based distros. It’s subject to distro bugs. Development and debugging is even more difficult than merely getting the software to run, again because of distro bugs.

32-bit Linux, as opposed to Windows, can address any amount of RAM that a modern computer can be built with, beyond 4 gigabyte. I believe configurations up to 64 GB are known to work, and it’s generally believed that the limit is much higher. This is accomplished by utilizing PAE, “Physical Address Extensions”, which requires extra care on part of drivers to allow them to manage vast amounts of physical memory. Every program is still limited to 4GB space, but hardware mappings and the total sum of all programs, kernel data and cache are not limited.

According to Mark Russinovich from Microsoft, the reason why Windows limits 32-bit versions to 4GB physical memory, in spite of them also supporting PAE, is that legacy drivers need to keep working, which are known to crash when subjected to higher physical addresses than 4GB. This limitation does not exist in Linux.

On Linux, benchmarks have shown 32-bit executables to typically behave at exact same performance between PAE-disabled, PAE-enabled, and true 64-bit configurations, unless there is memory contention, in which case PAE-disabled configuration loses. PAE-disabled configuration is no longer available in recent Ubuntu, and PAE had been enabled by default for a long time now. Native 64-bit executables have been shown to perform often either significantly better or significantly worse than 32-bit executables.

Thus for the purpose of this comparison, it is absolutely sufficient and correct to run it under 32-bit PAE-enabled Linux with comparison to a 32-bit executable on 64-bit Windows, and may in the meanwhile be the only way. Further along the road, extra performance gain from 64-bit Linux support is possible – 64-bit compiler on Linux compiles C++ code more efficiently due to a different ABI standard.

    *   Ondra says: [August 5, 2012 at 8:12 am](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/#comment-4810) Yes, you can — in fact, the great improvement of the 64-bit extensions to the x86 architecture is not so much the 64-bitness, but the increased number of registers, which means less storing temporary values in memory, which means speedups. (Just as a hard drive is much slower than RAM, RAM is much slower than direct register access.)

Other architectures are a different beast, of course — on PowerPC, for example, the jump to 64 bits didn’t increase the number of registers, so ppc64 applications, unless they work with gigantic numbers, are often slower than their ppc32 counterparts (since there are larger numbers to contend with and nothing to compensate).

Of course, a lot depends on the compiler. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=4810#respond)

As Android is – for most part – a distro of Linux, why is it relatively easy for developers to make great looking games (Take the MadFinger games as an example) on numerous handheld devices without many problems at all, yet this is something that Desktop builds of Linux have struggled with for decades? What makes it so different? Can you (Valve) learn something from the developers of Android games that would help you with the process of getting Linux into a fully working alternative to Windows?

Have Valve considered the idea by perhaps looking at a style Chromium route and having a linux gaming OS – a Steam OS if you will? Would this then not enable you to have full control over the entire Kernal etc, ensuring gaming performance would always be optimal?

Given the choice between maintaining a Windows installation I use only to run Steam, and a second Linux installation I use only to run Steam, the decision would be easy. Linux is easy for me to configure and maintain, and Windows is a constant hassle.

Of course, maintaining a Linux distribution is no small task, and Valve already have substantial business and technical commitments to their game projects and to the Steam platform. I would hope that shipping an entire distribution is not the path of least resistance to bringing Steam to Linux users, but would not find the situation untenable if that’s how it worked out. It’s also entirely conceivable that such a distribution could be easily maintained as a minor modification to one major distribution and the community could take care of it with no assistance from Valve.

 The reason for this is a chicken and the egg scenario, that Linux is made less popular due to the lack of games. Valve realises this and has decided to do something about it.

What is more interesting in this discussion than Win vs Linux is that you are working with hardware vendors. This just may wind up being the first of the major nails in the windows coffin.

The reason? The #1 problem I faced EVERY time I installed linux was video card drivers. Pretty much that was the main reason why laptops/desktops were compatible/incompatible with linux. The #2 was sound. And I am pretty sure that this is true for many others.

If you work with Nvidia/ATI/Intel to ensure that linux drivers are on the same quality in all aspects as the windows counterparts, I foresee linux gaining traction rather quickly.

Stalman said that you introducing DRM to a free OS is bad. I think you working with video card drivers is good, and if you were to convince them to open source their drivers so the linux community can finally get a crack at it, the benefits would go through the roof. I would not be surprised if linux open source video drivers would quickly begin to surpass windows in performance by leaps and bounds.

 -Pack Vertex Buffer Object(VBO) data tightly to remove the necessity of VBO sub-binds by separating each sub-array

 -Some Vendors (i.e. NVidia) suggest using 32-byte sized vertex structures for optimal performance

 -Batch render all VBO/IBO data

 -The most obvious optimization for OpenGL is to minimize state changes (I found using Observable pattern to control state changes helped immensely)

 -Use “gDebugger”, its performance tools are amazing and comparable to PIX (imho) [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=4135#respond)

I am not 100% if you guys are aware or not, but for those guys using:

Intel ( HD )

 Radeon ( R300 / R6/7 (r600g)) / non catalyst

May start posting issues with rendering / performance issues.

Reason being that the free drivers ( Open Source ) use Mesa ( now known as gallium ). Now as I am sure you are aware Gallium does not implement a full GL stack since it cannot due to patents on OpenGL extensions like S3TC and alike.

I think the question is, will Valve perhaps help leverage these patents invalid since really OpenGL should be just that, OPEN.

Also, to those crying foul, I have no issue with either valve not releasing source, or valve’s DRM. Why?

Because the problem with DRM is that it restricts what device you can run it on, in the case of games, this is not an issue since they have to be ported. There is nothing wrong with stopping piracy, which DRM helps to do (although not very well,) it’s only when it interferes with legitimate use that it becomes an issue, which this does not seem to do often.

Further, while I would highly appreciate valve releasing source (just engines, not game data), I don’t have the same expectation that they do this. Valve releases games, not programs that manage our money, nor that handle our communications. We aren’t required to play these games to earn income, they aren’t part of our lives in the way our OS is. If your OS spies on you, you have no expectation of privacy, if a game spies on you, it knows how well you aim. Games are also not reused in the same way normal programs are, although they benefit from each-other’s work, the benefit is less pronounced.

However, I really hate having blobs for drivers, please convince AMD and NVIDIA to open source their drivers, it would be better for users and game developers alike.

In a perfect world, all game engines would be open source, but we can’t always have a utopia. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=4177#respond)

TwinView, which stretches a virtual desktop across two monitors. To all the video games it looks like one big monitor, that’s why you are having that “half game on one, half on the other” problem.

 Second mode is “Separate X Screen”, which will allow you to use second monitor with a completely new instance of your Desktop Environment, you can even run KDE on one monitor, and Gnome on another.

First, are you using nVidia TwinView? I haven’t confirmed, but it’s possible you get that effect because TwinView announces the merged desktop to XRandR as a single monitor.

Second, have you tried setting up an xorg.conf with a MetaModes option? That’d allow you to add “one monitor at resolution X, the other turned off” as an option for fullscreening.

(Last time I used that, games Just Worked™ when you did that because it was closer to their desired aspect ratio than the merged desktop… but it periodically throws my desktop sticky notes into disarray so I don’t use it anymore.)

My approach these days is to set the game to run windowed at the resolution of one of my monitors, then set my window manager to automatically remove the window borders, set always on top, and position it to fill the one monitor exactly.

As a bonus, doing so lets me leave something visible on the other monitor so I can keep an eye on it. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=4358#respond)

Neither Xorg nor Wayland have very much to do with OpenGL rendering performance.

Granted you might lose some graphical quality (I’m not sure ambient occlusion or other advanced Source features done after the initial Half-Life 2 ship would be prudent, but the games themselves did run fine on my low end Pentium M with not-so-great Mobility Radeon 9200 graphics card).

Devices like (plug, plug) the Efika MX would make great little gaming boxes. Things like Torchlight or Half-Life 2, or Portal would work fine if you weren’t doing it for the special graphical effects or to stress out a GPU (intentionally). 800MHz and a low-end AMD-based GPU might not be that awesome, but 1.2GHz, quad core and a high-end OpenCL-capable GPU (as in i.MX6 or Tegra3) would certainly be available. After all, since 300fps is faster than we can even perceive visually, a steady 30fps is what we would like to see for a reasonable gaming experience ![Image 39: ;-)](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif) – and modern Mesa and modern GL support on Linux has GLES layered on top anyway so it’d still work on the big PCs.. ![Image 40: :)](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif) [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=4353#respond)

While it’s admirable that Valve is willing to put such a (relatively) big risk investing in Linux at only 5% of the marketshare, I think it’s asking too much to try and get them to also invest in a much much MUCH smaller smaller market besides that.

One part hasn’t been covered that I’ve spotted, so I’ll try again.

Will you be talking about how much success you have with increasing performance of Direct3D? It may sound counterintuitive to talk about Windows stuff on your Linux blog, but with OpenGL being a significant F/OSS project (and a key technology for Lunux game developers), it seems relevant.

Have the performance results you’ve cited changed the way that Valve looks and and approaches these technologies? Assuming that future titles (and engines?) will be cross platform, will OpenGL have a higher priority in general now that you seem to have tamed (or unleashed?) the beast?

I noticed that it was mentioned that you’ve been in touch with existing developers regarding getting their Linux games published – it would be pretty neat to have a future blog post about how that process has been and what kind of launch titles we might be able to expect.

Keep up the good work.

Also, once the engine is ported to Linux, wouldn’t that mean in theory it should work on Android (scalability and control issues aside)? Would you consider going down the route of creating an android app store for cross-device syncing of purchased games(apps)? Considering you’ll have steam on Linux, it seems like a logical step.

I just wish there was more time in the day to spend on tools to release something even half as polished/accessible as the Unreal engine so you can promote / sponsor more stuff running on Source and get more 3rd parties (especially indie) using your engine. As it stands, while Source can now run on Linux, Most of my Steam library doesn’t.

The guys at Google seem to be doing it right, although this seems unrelated, their Android SDK contains its own package management system (Much like steam) and functions perfectly across all sorts of distros, although I’m not sure how they do this and whether or not it’s of any use, it’s not like those tools are as hardware dependent and resource taxing on a computer as games.

This would create a steam dir that would update OTR, as would all games, so the thing with deps / pkg management evil is reduced / moot.

Why add the layer in the first place?.

A decent log system will tell you if a certain lib / driver or whatever should be able to tell you “hey your abc library is out of date!”. perhaps the steam client can do a quick sanity check to make sure its got the bare minimum reqs?.

Modern X11 protocol is designed with extensibility and compatibility in mind, it took years but it’s so good that programs written tens years ago can run on modern servers. But wayland currently looks just like a limited version of Xorg, something like X Windowing System in its early days. Even those few programs written for wayland break when the protocol changes in a new version. And some of its architecture decisions also look weird (no external taskbar/dockbar possible, no windowing managers, no decorators and hence no common desktop theme possible). Currently wayland popularity is based on the “X is bloated, Wayland will be better” words spread all over the internet, but it’s not really clear why wayland should be any better.

Talking about Xorg alternatives — how about checking out DirectFB? No xorg, no wayland, no intermediate servers, just the hardware and you.

 I’ve been surprised that it wasn’t specified nothing about compilers:

 - the mainsteam compiler used in Windows in my knowledge is MS Visual C++

 - on Linux is GCC

 As my knowledge goes, both of them are great optimizing compilers but generate different performance profilers, the tighter loop is not so well optimized, so you have to use other tricks to basically assembly loops or intriniscs.

 As for me this means to me one of the following things:

 - tighter loop is written in assembly, making the compiler to be of little relevance, as you know the final code what it would be

 - you’re using the same vendor on all platforms (Intel compiler!?, GCC/MinGW on Windows)

 - you’re using the best compiler (and best compiler options of the platform) and you notice that at the end the performance is similar

However you might want to check out project BumbleBee, which does the job nVidia didnt do… I hope this wont be a problem for Steam, because I am one of those gamer (ASUS G74SX with Optimus) and I have to dual boot because only the Intel chipset works properly under Linux (Ubuntu 11.04).

You’ve just erected the titanium framework to effect the largest mass exodus to the Free/Libre GNU/Linux operating system (in Desktop/Notebook role) in the history of Technology!! I mean, who wouldn’t want to gain nearly 20% in performance by switching to something that is licensed as absolutely FREE!! Outstanding!! Here are a few suggestions for success wtih GNU/Linux: 1.) Figure out how to apply the Android open source factor for developer frenzy-ness to the steam platform, 2.) In the same way that your major industry pull gives you obvious command over the graphics cards makers – convince **every** OEM (and also system 76, zareason, eightvirtues, etc.) to provide a specific Ubuntu GNU/Linux-based open-source Steam-preloaded gaming computer (notebook and desktop version) that is branded as such for the masses to embrace the rocking, newly-available 20% worth of awesomesauce, and 3.) Figure out some **very convincing** incentive for game producers to port their games to GNU/Linux in the steam platform (and ASAP) (this, I think, would be easily done after step 2 above is achieved). Way to revolutionize Steam! You Rock! These are exciting times for Technology indeed!! Humans Enabled – That’s what Technology is For!! Get your GNU/Linux on!!

IHV drivers for D3D9 are in kernel-space only and the whole user-space portion is provided by Microsoft, vendors have no control there.

In OpenGL vendors have “half” of the IHV in user-space so they can mitigate this by marshalling multiple operations and waiting for the right moment to do the syscall.

I *think* that some form of marshalling is supported by Direct3D10. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=4746#respond)

Will Valve make use of ATSC in the Linux port of L4D2? I believe the Nvidia drivers for Windows and Linux supporting the latest OpenGL 4.3 should be up soon… it would be fun to see Valve make use of ATSC instead of S3TC and show if it helped reduce the size of textures streamed to the GPU under Windows and Linux? I’m not a graphics person, but they seem to imply that switching from other formats like S3TC for compressed textures to ATSC will result in higher visual appeal, but perhaps they mean it enables for other effects operating on textures to result in higher visual appeal. Either way, the Linux port of L4D2 and Steam has given us a nice view into development at Valve and it would be great to see if ATSC further improves the situation.

    *   Koji says: [August 8, 2012 at 6:47 am](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/#comment-5044) Something to keep in mind, there is no hardware support for ASTC yet, so using that would not be helpful.

Also, only the proprietary AMD and nVidia drivers (will) support ASTC, and the proprietary drivers already support S3TC, so there is really no reason to switch away from it.

Finally, ASTC is not a completed standard yet. There is a reason it is only an optional part of OpenGL 4.3 and that anything made with the current spec may not be compatible with future specs. In all likelyhood, it’s going to be another 3-5 years minimum before we see the standard adopted (and most likely, not until it’s supported in DX12-13 in hardware for cross-platform support) [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=5044#respond)

This post said a lot for me, here’s a test of my machine running Amnesia: The Dark Descent on Wine (on Ubuntu 12.04) with a nVidea 310m, and I can max out everything. I did a test for both 64 bit OS (Windows and Ubuntu):

Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit:

 (Maximum settings supported)

 1280×720

 Shadows: Low

 Texture Quality: Medium

 Max FPS: 50-60

Notes: Any higher would make my machine overheat and crash. Various laggy points during gameplay. Best results were closing explorer.exe.

Ubuntu 12.04

 (Maximum settings supported)

 1920×900 (Max res for the display I was using)

 Shadows: High

 Texture Quality: High

 Max FPS: 30-45 FPS

Notes: No lag in gameplay whatsoever, fan was at low, and my machine’s overall temperature was cool. So far, no crashes or problems.

The results were from Ubuntu were extremely positive, its like its almost native! This proved to me that I should and will be using Linux for the rest of my life ![Image 55: ;-)](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)

 I am technologically competent, yet I cannot seem to get any version of Linux to run completely on any system. I have tried on and off for years: Mandrake, RedHat, Ubuntu, Puppy, DSL, and dozens of other distributions on dozens of media, dozens of versions on many builds. Occasionally I will succeed in booting to a desktop but in those cases there is always the issue of drivers: never does all my hardware work.

I have friends that are ‘into’ Linux, but they have never shown me a fully working installation either. I have heard many and varied claims of it’s wonders but everytime I ask to see their Linux install their is a convenient excuse for why at this moment in time one aspect or another of the system isn’t quite functioning.

The only working Linux I’ve seen is on my android phone, a radical departure from more traditional flavors.

I am excited and glad to know that Valve is working with hardware manufacturer’s on driver support, but I hope they are also working on the installation and distribution side of things. It would be wondrous if this operating system could operate my system, because as things stands today only Windows can operate a wide variety of systems.*

Gonzalez says: [August 9, 2012 at 3:18 am](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/#comment-5099) Sorry but it isn’t Linux that doesn’t work with a wide variety of hardware but the hardware that doesn’t work with the wide variety of Linux. This is an immensely hard fact for most technically competent users to understand.

Windows doesn’t do drivers for hardware not made by Microsoft and when end-users run into problems on Windows, update your drivers (The ones made by developers targeting Windows and whom the know the hardware best) is the mantra.

You can build an amazing system with cross-operating-system support if you research what you’re buying. If the hardware claims to be supported on Linux, you can almost be certain it’ll be supported on Windows and in the end, a sweet dual boot computer.

It only takes a single piece of hardware (just imagine any piece) to be unsupported for your experience with Linux to be considered an epic fail but when all the pieces come together, it certainly feels like an epic win.

Good luck, I hope you give it another try sometime and I hope it works out for you. [Reply](http://blogs.valvesoftware.com/linux/faster-zombies/?replytocom=5099#respond)

It would be interesting to see a comparison between the closed-source drivers and the nouveau and radeon drivers (open-source drivers for NVidia and AMD cards, respectively). It’s more than just a difference in ideology: the open-source drivers are part of the kernel, come with most distros by default, and are updated alongside other system packages. The user experience is so much cleaner with the open-source drivers. I feel like it would be an all-around win if this effort resulted in better open-source drivers as well!

The Valve Linux Team

Our mission is to strengthen the gaming scene on Linux, both for players and developers. This includes Linux ports of Steam and Valve games, as well as partner games. We are also investigating open source initiatives that could benefit the community and game developers.

Initially formed in 2011, the Valve Linux team is currently 11 people and growing. Our mission is to investigate open source development with a specific focus on supporting Steam and other Valve products on the Linux platform. The Linux background of our team varies from those who have a deep knowledge of Linux development to those who have just scratched the surface. However, one thing we all share is a great passion for supporting all things Valve on Linux. We are currently seeking experienced developers for Mac, Linux (kernel and driver), and OpenGL to fill our team. If you match these qualifications, please let us [know](mailto:valvelinuxteam@valvesoftware.com).
