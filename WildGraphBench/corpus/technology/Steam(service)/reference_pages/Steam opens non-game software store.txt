Steam opens non-game software store

[Omri Petitte](http://www.pcgamer.com/author/omripetitte/ "Posts by Omri Petitte") at 07:43pm October 2 2012 

[![Image 4](http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2012/10/Steam_Software-610x224.jpg)](http://media.pcgamer.com/files/2012/10/Steam_Software.jpg)

Valve quietly updated its Steam storefront today with its [“Software” tab](http://store.steampowered.com/software/ "Steam: Software"), selling utility, development, and benchmarking tools. Although Valve announced its move into non-game products [as early as August](http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/08/08/steam-to-start-hosting-non-game-software/ "Steam to start hosting non-game software"), today marks the public availability of visual and structural development apps on the digital distribution giant.

Valve is still slowly furnishing its software catalog, but a few choice items for purchase include GameMaker: Studio, 3DMark 11, and ArtRage Studio Pro. Coupled with the recently launched Greenlight indie voting platform, and it appears Steam is gradually transforming into a one-stop destination for every facet of a game’s creation process.

All software is 10% off for the first week. Additionally, GameMaker: Studio is free to use without purchasing a license, and has Steam Workshop integration. Aspiring developers, go make the next FTL, would you?
