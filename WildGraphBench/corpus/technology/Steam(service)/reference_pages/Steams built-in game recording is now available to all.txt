is a former weekend editor who covered tech and entertainment. He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.

Steam Game Recording [is officially out of beta](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4472730495692571025) and [available to all users](https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fgamerecording&xcust=__vg1202awD__24053179__________________), giving PC, Mac, and Steam Deck players a built-in way to record and share audio and video from their gaming sessions. It joins many other ways PC gamers have been able to record their highlights, including as a feature of tools like the[Xbox Game Bar](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21222533/record-screen-pc-windows-laptop-xbox-game-bar-how-to), [Nvidia GeForce](https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/23/4358300/nvidia-shadowplay-and-geforce-gtx-780), and AMD’s Adrenalin.

This version of the Steam client is also the first to drop support for Windows 7 and 8 machines, as well as Macs running macOS 10.13 and 10.14 after [Valve announced the move](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/1/24021950/steam-has-now-officially-stopped-supporting-windows-7-windows-8-and-windows-8-1) at the beginning of this year.

[![Image 9: Steam Game Recording simulated screenshot showing a player using the tool to share a clip.](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25717441/videoframe_10152.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C0%2C100%2C100&w=2400)](https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/chorus/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25717441/videoframe_10152.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,0,100,100)

After an automatic update, players can start recordings manually using a hotkey (Ctrl + F11 is the default) or set it to trigger automatically, with options to restrict the length, quality, and storage space that Steam can use. Valve says it works with any game, including non-Steam games that allow Steam Overlay to run. Recording is off by default — you’ll find its settings in a new Game Recording tab in Steam’s settings.

Valve has updated Steam Game Recording with a [handful of new features](https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4530150757095178611?utm_source=SteamDB) that weren’t there when the beta period [began in June](https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/26/24186716/valve-steam-native-game-recording-tool-deck), including adding “advanced” export options and the ability to configure game-specific settings. The company also added Session View, which includes a “Recordings & Screenshots manager with game-specific tags and data.”
