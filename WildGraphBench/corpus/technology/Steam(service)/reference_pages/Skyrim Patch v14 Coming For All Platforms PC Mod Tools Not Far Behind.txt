Even though Bethesda Softworks managed to bring in all manner of awards and accolades for last year's _[The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim](http://www.g4tv.com/games/xbox-360/64714/the-elder-scrolls-5-skyrim/)_, the game was not without it's flaw. Big, beautiful, gaping flaws that are as hilarious as they are frustrating. Still, they need to be fixed, and the lengthy process of implemeneting those fixes continues soon with the upcoming v1.4 patch.

A new [blog post](http://www.bethblog.com/2012/01/19/news-on-the-creation-kit-and-game-updates/) from Bethesda runs through the long list of planned improvements. Notable among them is a PS3-specific fix that is meant to address that platform's widely reported lag issues with the game. The patch is expected to be ready for certification from console manufacturers sometime next week, which also means that next week is probably when PC players can expect to see the fixes implemented.

The blog post also notes that the promised Creation Kit PC mod tools are still on track for release before the end of this month. That and Steam Workshop support are both being tested with Valve and modding community members. Hit the jump for the full list of 1.4 changes.

The only glitches that have happen to me is my spouse went flying, i didnt get a dragon soul, and i had an arrow stuck in my hip for several hours (days in the game).

I've decided to put Skyrim aside and focus on other games until they're finished patching it. I've lost two game saves to glitches. This kind of thing makes me never want to buy a brand new game again. I think from now on I'm going to buy all games once they've been out 1 year. Should give devs enough time to patch them, and the prices should drop at least a little bit. Win-win for me.

I play on PS3 and I'm curious to see how effective this patch is for the lagging. I have two characters, one is level 50 and the other is 60 something (glad there isn't a level cap at 50), and so far the only thing that bothers me is this lag. Haven't come across any game-breaking glitches yet unless you would consider not being able to become thane of Solitude "game-breaking" (Elisif is nowhere to be found after Stormcloak victory), which I don't.

Sucks that they're still not gonna fix that Ancient Shrouded Cowl facemask glitch. It's not fair that only female characters get to look like badass ninjas =/

Has anyone notice that they're are alot of "updates" for games these days. Back then games had little to no glitches in them. Now their seems to be an "update" for every game out, games like Dead Island, Fallout, and Dragon Age 2 and thats just a few of them. To me I think some game companies are giving us the consumers unfinished products.

These patches serve as a consolation prize, of sorts, for those of us too poor to buy things when they first come out. At least the game will be fixed by the time I get to it. 

...I am tired of being poor.

See what I don't understand is how can everyone say this is the greatest rpg in the ever and then glaze over all the bugs? G4 gave it a 5/5 yet they barely mentioned that the bugs are sometimes game breaking. No game, no matter how good, deserves such high praise with this many technical problems.

So far the only glitches I've found have been my Thieves Guild quest line stopping after going to Golden Glow so I could not talk to Maven afterwards to go onto the next quest and after I got my archery to level 100 I somehow contracted a disease that brought my level down to a red 15 eventhough I am a werewolf. No idea how I can get my level back to 100 either :(

* The Unusual Gem inside the Thalmor Embassy is now accessible after finishing Diplomatic Immunity was bugged for me until I realized you could use a horse to jump the side walls and get in that way (there's also a complicate way to get in through the exit cave, but the horse-jumping plan is so much easier).

* The White Phial will now start properly if player already has a briar heart in their inventory is still stuck in my quest log. I may go back to complete it after the patch.

I still have a repeating "Kill the Giant" quest where the giant is invisible and can't be affected, but other than that, the other two bug fixes will complete my quest log.

When I first started the game, I didn't too many problems other than the lag you get for playing for too long. But, ever since the patches started coming, my game is getting worse and worse. The other day my memory was almost corrupted because skyrim froze on me. Is this the same for anyone else?

I believe the term "long play" applies to the accumulated hours of total play time, not continuous playtime.

Long term play optimizations for memory and performance (PS3).

 Not sure if that's the fix we've been hoping for.

 I just started experiencing the lag issues last night, about 50hrs in. It's fairly mild atm but consistantly there, and is not caused from "long term play" since it happens the momment you load up.

 "long term play" is actually some pretty tricky choice of words to use there.. it could either mean - after playing for a couple hours straight, or long term as in saved game 10's of hours long.

 Whatever it means to Bethesda, I still hopeful it fixes the issue. It's not nearly as enjoyable with a slight stutter everytime you or something else moves, and the aburpt item/setpiece loading that goes for a split second after a loadscreen is an immersion killer too.
