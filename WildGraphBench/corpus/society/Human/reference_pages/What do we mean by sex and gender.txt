What do we mean by "sex" and "gender"?
======================================

Sometimes it is hard to understand exactly what is meant by the term "gender", and how it differs from the closely related term "sex".

**"Sex"** refers to the biological and physiological characteristics that define men and women.

**"Gender"** refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviours, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for men and women.

To put it another way:

**"Male" and "female" are sex categories, while "masculine" and "feminine" are gender categories.**

Aspects of sex will not vary substantially between different human societies, while aspects of gender may vary greatly.

Some examples of sex characteristics :

*   Women menstruate while men do not 
*   Men have testicles while women do not 
*   Women have developed breasts that are usually capable of lactating, while men have not 
*   Men generally have more massive bones than women

Some examples of gender characteristics :

*   In the United States (and most other countries), women earn significantly less money than men for similar work 
*   In Viet Nam, many more men than women smoke, as female smoking has not traditionally been considered appropriate 
*   In Saudi Arabia men are allowed to drive cars while women are not
*   In most of the world, women do more housework than men
