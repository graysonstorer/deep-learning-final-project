Hair everywhere

Getty Images/Hero Images

Good God, you’re a hairy beast. You may not think you are, and compared with, say, a [chimpanzee](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225235006/https://www.newscientist.com/article-topic/monkeys-and-apes), you appear distinctly bald. But in fact your entire body (with the exception of the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet) is covered in hair. All told you have about 5 million follicles, about the same as chimps and other primates.

But the similarities stop there. [Human hair is decidedly strange](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225235006/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg16321985-400-glad-to-be-naked/). Most of our body hair is so wispy and short as to be almost invisible, though in some places it is coarse and curly. Our head hair is almost uniquely long and flamboyant. We are pretty much the only animal to have hair that grows continuously for many years, and also to suffer the indignity of going bald. No wonder our relationship with our hair is a tangled one.

A duet of hairs
---------------

Human hair comes in two basic types: terminal hair, which grows on the scalp, eyebrows and eyelashes, and vellus hair, which is found everywhere else. Beyond that, the main difference between hair types is how long they grow for before the follicle runs out of steam. This is what determines their length and thickness.

Hair follicles go through[cycles of growth and dormancy](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225235006/https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27323-painful-baldness-cure-regenerate-hair-by-plucking-whats-left/). During the growth phase the hair grows continuously at about 0.4 millimetres per day, getting longer and thicker in the process. But at some point the hair-producing cells die off and growth stops. The hair falls out and the follicle goes dormant for around six months before sprouting new hair-producing cells and entering a new growth phase.

The length of the growth phase is [controlled by hormones](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225235006/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23531383-400-chemical-controllers-how-hormones-influence-your-body-and-mind/). Leg hairs grow for about two months, which is why they are short and fine. Armpit hairs make it to six months, but head hairs grow non-stop for six years or more. That means head hair can theoretically grow to almost a metre in length.

Ideas abound as to why evolution has endowed us with such a unique combination of hair types. The leading one is that when our bipedal ancestors moved out of the forests and onto the searing heat of the savannah, they needed to keep their bodies cool while also sheltering their big brains from the sun. Body hair receded, removing an unnecessary insulating layer and also allowing the skin to be cooled by sweating. Hair loss was also presumably aided by technological innovations such as clothes, fire and cave-dwelling, which lessened the importance of fur for keeping warm at night. Head hair, meanwhile, became thicker and more luxuriant, protecting our ancestors’ brains from the midday sun, and also retaining heat in the cold.

[Genetic evidence suggests that we became furless](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225235006/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327261-000-why-are-we-the-naked-ape/) around 1.7 million years ago. Around this time our ancestor _Homo erectus_ was living on the baking savannah, which supports the thermoregulation hypothesis.

Look! No parasites
------------------

But it is not the only possibility. We may also have lost body hair to improve our ability to identify others and to make communication easier, or to resist disease, since fur is a prime habitat for parasites. There’s also sexual selection, which was [Charles Darwin](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225235006/https://www.newscientist.com/article-topic/charles-darwin/)‘s preferred explanation. For whatever reason, the least hairy of our ancestors were considered the most attractive and so produced more offspring. [Hair-free skin may have been a billboard to advertise good health](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225235006/https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn3807-early-humans-lost-hair-to-beat-bugs/) and hence attract mates – a sexual come-on saying, “Look how unblemished and parasite-free I am.”

Sexual selection could also explain our head hair. Most people find a strong, healthy head of hair attractive. Indeed, precisely because our head hair needs so much care, it makes a perfect hoarding upon which to advertise social and sexual status. Grooming is time-consuming, and so having well-groomed hair shows you are resourceful and have good social contacts. If this is correct, then the main function of head hair is to be cut and styled for maximum impact. This might explain why lank, unkempt locks are the mark of the social pariah.

Prehistoric styling
-------------------

Some of the most ancient figurines do have coiffed hair. The oldest known three-dimensional representation of a human, the 25,000-year-old ivory Venus of Brassempouy, has elegant shoulder-length hair. And hair products are nothing new either. The 2300-year-old Clonycavan Man, discovered in a bog in County Meath, Ireland, was wearing hair gel made of plant oils and pine resin.

Hair may also have been used to signal group identity. Throughout the ages and across cultures, we have used hairstyles as a mark of membership: think Roundheads, Rastafarians and rockabillies.

Enough about the hair on your head. [Pubic hair](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225235006/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327200-900-10-mysteries-of-you-pubic-hair/) is possibly even more unusual. Most primates have finer hair around their genitals than on the rest of their body, but adult humans are the exact opposite.

There’s no accepted explanation. One possibility is that since thicker hair coincides with regions where we have apocrine (scent) glands, it may serve to concentrate or waft odours that signal sexual maturity. Pubic hair may also protect the genitals during sex and at other times – reducing chafing while walking, for example – and also helps keep our most sensitive regions warm and free of draughts.

Whatever it evolved for, many people now subject the hair in their pubic regions to as much grooming as the hair on their heads, while ruthlessly removing it from the rest of their bodies. Hairless we ain’t – but not for lack of trying.

### Baldylocks

Pity the human male: along with the stump-tailed macaque, he is the only primate to routinely suffer the indignity of a receding hairline.

By age 30, a quarter of men have started to go bald, and by 45, half have. [Male pattern baldness](https://web.archive.org/web/20210225235006/https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428692.100-why-havent-bald-men-gone-extinct/) has a predictable trajectory: hair begins to disappear on the temples, then on the top of the head, before staging a general retreat that leaves the entire pate hairless.

Except that it doesn’t. Baldness is not about having no hair; it is about having the wrong sort of hair. Bald heads have just as many follicles as any other – about 100,000 – but the follicles have ceased to function properly and only produce colourless and wispy hairs.
