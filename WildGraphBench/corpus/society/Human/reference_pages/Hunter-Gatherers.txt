Chapter 23 - Hunter-Gatherers
-----------------------------

Abstract
--------

Human hunter-gatherer (H-G) populations date back to earliest Paleolithic times more than 200,000 years ago, although nonhuman primate ancestral hunting probably dates back to earlier times. H-G populations/societies constituted all human social groups until the Neolithic Revolution (10,000–12,000 years ago), when agriculture and husbandry developed and then became the dominant pattern of subsistence. H-G numbers declined after the Neolithic and then further during the age of exploration and colonization in the sixteenth through nineteenth centuries, when indigenous groups became marginalized and the H-G population showed further declines. Living H-G populations make up only a tiny fraction of the seven billion people on the planet. Existing hunter-gatherers are largely acculturated and remain in enclaves in tropical Africa, South America, and Southeast Asia. These remaining populations show considerable variation in subsistence, diet and nutrition, demographic characteristics, disease patterns, reproduction, child growth, and overall health. Because of the small-scale population units that characterize most H-G societies, they have been essentially free from most epidemic diseases, but have been subject to heavy parasite loads and infections. Death rates are high and life expectancies at birth are low, and natural selection has probably operated in a major way via differential mortality. Other evolutionary forces may have operated through genetic drift because of the small bands in which hunter-gatherers lived. The use of contemporary or historical H-G populations as models of prehistoric hunter-gatherers is still a debated issue.
