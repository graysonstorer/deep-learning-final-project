The origins of political order : from prehuman times to the French Revolution
=============================================================================

Author: [Francis Fukuyama](https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=au=%22Fukuyama%2C%20Francis%22)

Summary: Virtually all human societies were once organized tribally, yet over time most developed new political institutions which included a central state that could keep the peace and uniform laws that applied to all citizens. Some went on to create governments that were accountable to their constituents. We take these institutions for granted, but they are absent or are unable to perform in many of today's developing countries--with often disastrous consequences for the rest of the world
