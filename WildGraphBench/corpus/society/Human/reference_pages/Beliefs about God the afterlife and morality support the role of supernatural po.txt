# Beliefs about God, the afterlife and morality support the role of supernatural policing in human cooperation

Evolution and Human Behavior 32 (2011) 41 – 49 Original Article Beliefs about God, the afterlife and morality support the role of supernatural policing in human cooperation☆ Quentin D. Atkinsona,b,⁎,1 , Pierrick Bourrata,1 a Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK b Department of Psychology, University of Auckland, Auckland 1142, New Zealand Initial receipt 13 February 2010; final revision received 28 July 2010 Abstract Reputation monitoring and the punishment of cheats are thought to be crucial to the viability and maintenance of human cooperation in large groups of non-kin. However, since the cost of policing moral norms must fall to those in the group, policing is itself a public good subject to exploitation by free riders. Recently, it has been suggested that belief in supernatural monitoring and punishment may discourage individuals from violating established moral norms and so facilitate human cooperation. Here we use cross-cultural survey data from a global sample of 87 countries to show that beliefs about two related sources of supernatural monitoring and punishment — God and the afterlife — independently predict respondents' assessment of the justifiability of a range of moral transgressions. This relationship holds even after controlling for frequency of religious participation, country of origin, religious denomination and level of education. As well as corroborating experimental work, our findings suggest that, across cultural and religious backgrounds, beliefs about the permissibility of moral transgressions are tied to beliefs about supernatural monitoring and punishment, supporting arguments that these beliefs may be important promoters of cooperation in human groups. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, such with stricter taboos and prohibitions lasted longest. enforcement generally incurs a cost that must be borne by It remains unclear exactly why religion should have this those in the group. Enforcement, then, is itself a public good effect. Dunbar (2009) argues that endorphin release during subject to exploitation by free riders. Economic games under intensely arousing rituals, such as communal singing or anonymous laboratory conditions have revealed that humans trance dancing, may directly enhance bonding within small are willing to pay a cost to punish free riders (Fehr & groups. Irons (1996a,b) has used signalling theory from Gachter, 2002; Gintis, Bowles, Boyd, & Fehr, 2003) or biology to argue that restrictive taboos or costly rituals (that reward cooperators (Rand, Dreber, Ellingsen, Fudenberg, & are risky, unpleasant or demanding of time and resources) Nowak, 2009), but it is not clear to what extent this promote trust and cooperation more indirectly by providing generalizes to real-world social interactions. Such a strategy reliable signals of commitment to the group. However, the remains vulnerable to exploitation by ‘second-order free finding that religious groups are more prosocial and robust riders’ who avoid the cost of punishment, unless those who than their statistically controlled secular counterparts shirk punishing duties are themselves punished (and those suggests that there is more to religious cooperation than who shirk the punishing of non-punishers are punished, and participation and proscription. so on) or there is some external policing mechanism The nature of religious belief itself is also thought to (Henrich & Boyd, 2001). The supernatural punishment influence levels of cooperation (Bering, 2006; Johnson & hypothesis (Johnson & Krüger, 2004) holds that the threat of Krüger, 2004; Norenzayan & Shariff, 2008; Roes & supernatural punishment (in this life or the afterlife) arising Raymond, 2003; Snarey, 1996; Stark, 2001). Stark (2001) from belief in morally concerned supernatural agents can has shown that strength of belief in God is a better predictor help enforce cooperative norms by exporting the cost of of prosocial attitudes than church attendance. This raises the enforcement to ostensibly infallible supernatural forces question of what it is about the beliefs religious individuals beyond the group. Belief in a punitive supernatural agent hold that could promote prosociality. One mechanism that can, in principle, exert this effect without requiring that the has been put forward is that belief in the existence of a imagined agent actually punishes free riders — it is enough supernatural agent or agents can increase prosocial behav- that group members perceive such a threat. iour merely by creating the perception of being watched.

To the extent that some prosocial behaviours (cf.

Third, moralizing high gods to other societal characteristics remain following the supernatural monitoring hypothesis, we obscure. Conversely, experimental work supports a link predict that, among those who believe in God, those between priming supernatural agent concepts and individual individuals who profess belief in a personal God will rate cooperation, but we do not yet know whether such effects moral transgressions as less justifiable than those who apply to long-standing beliefs about supernatural agents and believe in a Spirit or Life Force, since believing in a enduring moral dispositions.

Moral transgressions Here, we test these predictions using questionnaire data from Since the first wave of the WVS, questionnaires have the WVS on individuals' beliefs about God and the afterlife, asked individuals about the justifiability of a range of moral together with ratings of the justifiability of a standard set of transgressions. We took advantage of these variables to moral transgressions. This direct approach — asking approach the morality component of our hypotheses. Not all individuals to state their beliefs about the supernatural and items were used in all countries, but the majority were, about conformity to the moral order — is of course subject making it possible to examine variation in moral thinking to the potential biases and limitations of any self-report data. across a range of cultural and religious backgrounds. Of the The advantage of such an approach, however, is that a large 31 moral transgressions listed in the WVS we selected 14 amount of information can be collected from across many items that were the most well sampled across countries and different cultural settings.

However, responses “F028. — Apart from weddings, funerals and christenings, about how often do you attend religious services these days?” should provide a reasonable indication of likely conformity to the moral order across the different categories of people we ‘More than once a week’ test here. We do not require that justifiability ratings give an ‘Once a week’ absolute measure of cooperation, since our hypotheses relate ‘Once a month’ only to the relative likelihood of cooperation. ‘Only on special holy days/Christmas/Easter days’ 2.1.2.

Most notably, the association between morality and (Edwards, 1953) or impression management (Leary & belief in heaven or hell shows some sensitivity to controlling Kowalski, 1990) effects may cause a bias in some for other religious and cultural factors, such that seven out of individuals' responses to questions about both religion and 14 morality items do not show a significant relationship in morality.
