I.

What does it mean to be happy?

The answer to this question once seemed obvious to me. To be happy is to be satisfied with your life. If you want to find out how happy someone is, you ask him a question like, “Taking all things together, how satisfied are you with your life as a whole?”

> Are you satisfied with your life? How are you feeling? Does either question tell us what we really want to know?

Over the past 30 years or so, as the field of happiness studies has emerged from social psychology, economics and other disciplines, many researchers have had the same thought. Indeed this “life satisfaction” view of happiness lies behind most of the happiness studies you’ve read about. Happiness embodies your _judgment_ about your life, and what matters for your happiness is something for you to decide.

This is an appealing view. But I have come to believe that it is probably wrong. Or at least, it can’t do justice to our everyday concerns about happiness.

One of the most remarkable findings in this area of psychology, for instance, is just how many poor people say they are satisfied with their lives — very often a majority of them, even in harsh environments like the slums of Calcutta. In a recent study of poor Egyptians, researchers asked them to explain why they were satisfied, and their responses often took something like this form: “One day is good and the other one is bad; whoever accepts the least lives.” This sounds like resignation, not happiness. Yet these Egyptians were, in terms of life satisfaction, happy.

The problem is that life satisfaction doesn’t really mean what we tend to think it means. For you can reasonably be satisfied with your life even if you think your life is going badly for you, and even if you feel bad. To be satisfied is just to regard your life as going well _enough_— it is satisfactory. You might think even a hard slog through a joyless existence is good enough. It sure beats being dead, and maybe you feel you have no right to complain about what God, or fate, has given you.

Similarly, you might be satisfied with a hard life because you care about things besides avoiding misery. Perhaps you are a dissident in an autocratic state and suffering dearly for it, yet you are satisfied with your life because you believe in what you are doing. But are you happy? Probably not.

I do not mean to suggest that life satisfaction studies can’t give us useful information about how people are doing. But I am suggesting that it is misleading to equate satisfaction with happiness, even if it is perfectly ordinary to talk that way at times.

So how else might we define happiness? There is another approach popular among researchers — one that focuses on _feelings_. If you feel good, and not bad, you’re happy. Feeling good may not be all that matters, but it certainly sounds like a more suitable candidate for happiness than a judgment that your life is good enough. Evidently, those Egyptians do not feel good, and that has a lot to do with why it seems unnatural to say that they are happy.

But what exactly is this “feeling good”? The standard view is this: Happiness is pleasure, and unhappiness is pain, or suffering. Philosophers call this view “hedonism” about happiness. If we think of happiness as pleasure, we can see why people value happiness so highly: Who really prefers misery to enjoyment? Lots of philosophers, like Epicurus, Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, have thought that pleasure and suffering are all that ultimately matters. Hedonism about happiness has an obvious appeal. It is natural to think of happiness as a matter of feelings, and what else could this mean but having pleasant feelings?

But I have come to believe that this approach is also probably wrong. When you look at the way researchers study this kind of happiness, you’ll notice something peculiar: Their questionnaires almost always ask about emotions and mood states, and rarely ask directly about pleasure, pain or suffering. In fact, you might have thought that if happiness researchers were really interested in pleasure and pain, among their queries would be questions about _pain_ (“Do you suffer from chronic pain?” and so on). Such pains make a tremendous difference in how pleasant our lives are, yet happiness surveys rarely ask about them.

Why not? Because, I would venture, these researchers aren’t really thinking of happiness as pleasure, as they take themselves to be doing. Rather, they’re tacitly thinking of happiness in another, more interesting way.

II.

I would suggest that when we talk about happiness, we are actually referring, much of the time, to a complex emotional phenomenon. Call it emotional well-being. Happiness as emotional well-being concerns your emotions and moods, more broadly your emotional condition as a whole. To be happy is to inhabit a favorable emotional state.

> Unhappiness is not just a brute animal response to your life. It is you, as a person, responding to your life as being somehow deficient.

On this view, we can think of happiness, loosely, as the opposite of anxiety and depression. Being in good spirits, quick to laugh and slow to anger, at peace and untroubled, confident and comfortable in your own skin, engaged, energetic and full of life. To measure happiness, we might use extended versions of existing questionnaires for anxiety and depression from the mental-health literature. Already, such diagnostics often ask questions about positive states like laughter and cheerfulness, or your ability to enjoy things.

The emotional state theory of happiness has significant advantages over the hedonistic view. Consider, for starters, that we don’t normally think of pain as an emotion or mood. It seems more natural, for example, to think of back pain as something that _causes_ unhappiness, not as unhappiness itself. A more important point is that we are fundamentally emotional beings. Who we are is in great part defined by our emotional natures, by what ways of living make us happy. Yes, we have animal needs for food, shelter, clothing and the like. But we also have needs as _persons_, and happiness concerns the fulfillment of those needs.

What sorts of needs are we talking about? Among the most important sources of happiness are: a sense of security; a good outlook; autonomy or control over our lives; good relationships; and skilled and meaningful activity. If you are unhappy, there’s a good chance that it’s for want of something on this list.

Unhappiness is not just a brute physical or animal response to your life. It is _you_, as a person, responding to your life as being somehow deficient. Unhappiness, like happiness, says something about your personality. Whereas back pain does not: It is just a sensation, something that happens to you. Accordingly, Buddhists and Stoics do not counsel us not to feel pain; their training aims, instead, at not letting pain and other irritants _get_ to us.

Our language also marks the difference: You merely _feel_ a pain, but you _are_ depressed, anxious, melancholy or whatever. Similarly, you might have a depressive or anxious or cheerful personality. But we never talk of someone having a “painful” or “pleasureful” personality.

Note also how we don’t worry about taking medicine for pain the way we often do about taking “happiness” pills like antidepressants. We worry that by artificially changing our mood we risk not being “us.” But no one feels inauthentic because he took ibuprofen to relieve his back pain.

III.

While the emotional-state view of happiness might seem common-sensical, it was barely discussed 20 years ago, and the differences between this approach and hedonism still are not widely acknowledged in the scientific literature on happiness. Why has it been so neglected?

The reason, I suspect, is that we tend to take a superficial view of the emotional realm. In the popular imagination, the rich tapestry of our emotional lives is reduced to nearly a point — or rather, two points for eyes, a “U” for a mouth and a circle enclosing them. But there is much more to happiness than the smiley-face emotion of feeling happy.

Our very language is deficient, and so we sometimes reach for other expressions that better convey the depth and richness of happiness: happiness as a matter of the psyche, spirit or soul. Researchers rightly tend to avoid such metaphors in their scholarly work, which demands clearly defined terminology. But even those of us who do not believe in immaterial souls often find this sort of language usefully evocative, as our technical vocabulary can be pretty feeble in expressing the complexities of human experience. At times, then, I have found it useful to employ terms like psychic affirmation or, for the truly thriving, psychic flourishing. We are not just talking about “being in a good mood.”

So there is something specially human about happiness, something that speaks to our natures and needs as persons. And meeting our needs as persons — our spiritual needs, one might say — seems to have a special importance.

Why should these needs, these aspects of ourselves, be so important? There is a long history of philosophical thought, with roots stretching back at least to Plato and Aristotle in Greece, and the Vedas in India, that conceives of human flourishing in terms of the fulfillment of the self. Human well-being, on this sort of view, means living in accordance with your nature, with who you are. On this way of thinking, we might regard happiness as a central part of self-fulfillment.

Furthermore, our emotional conditions may provide the single best indicator of how, in general, our lives are going. They don’t simply track the moment-to-moment flow of events. If you are generally depressed, anxious or stressed, you will probably not find an answer to your problems by scrutinizing the day’s events one by one. It may be wiser, instead, to consider whether the way you are living really makes sense. Often, the signals of the emotional self can set us on the path to better ways of living — and a happiness worthy of the name.

Hawaii[December 19, 2015](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/happiness-and-its-discontents/#permid=16993625)
To me, the author, Daniel Haybron, brought up some excellent points regarding the topic and laid them out superbly. I particularly like his linking of happiness to the emotional self, i.e., feeling good, because it points to what I see as the primal reality of happiness--it's indication that we are either surviving well or not. This judgement, that only we, ourselves, make, involves our entire body/mind being; that is, it's not primarily cognitive as the "think positive" folks would have you believe. It is the felt sense of competency that imbues us with "feeling good." So, to me, the happiness/unhappiness quotient serves as a thermostat to direct our path through time towards more competent living--which does mean our survival vs. non-survival. Therefore, let's not write survival off as some kind a minimum value because what it actually is is a potential, and measured in terms of deep time, an unlimited one--our dreams of happiness merely its faintest shadow.

I'm 67, having the best time of my life, accomplishing more and happier than in any other period of my life.

Happiness as well as age are a matter of perception and besides what I said above, I'm also healthier.

Of course I've always felt that I was very fortunate, very lucky and very blessed.

No, I'm not rich or famous but who cares?

And, every day is a beautiful day!

To be happy is to see the beauty that surrounds you. It is real, it's there to be touched and felt and experienced. Happiness comes from doing what's right and good; and not postponing that task. Happiness is not resignation, knowing full well that you have the power to make things better - all the time.

This is for "Uncle Bear": Not everything can be empirically demonstrated. Science doesn't explain everything, and it hasn't explored everything. Telling people to "prove" what they believe, without stating what you DO believe, isn't the best way to encourage people to explain why they believe as they do.

What about Mick Jagger, who sang again and again that he "Can't get no satisfaction"? What about Sophocles, who supposedly said that "One must wait until the evening to see how splendid the day has been. Haybron concludes: "Often, the signals of the emotional self can set us on the path to better ways of living — and a happiness worthy of the name." Isn't that encompassed in Socrates' "Know thyself"?

I wrote a paper on happiness 30 years ago for a college course in philosophy and still find my thoughts true. Happy to me means not wanting to be doing anything other than what you are doing.

Folks who are happy do not suffer "the grass is greener" syndrome, nor wish for bodies or lifestyles different than the ones they have. Happiness is satisfaction. Simple.

It is, on the contrary, rarely that simple. Anyone who suffers from depression, anxiety, and other psycho- and neurological brain disorders knows, one can be thoroughly mystified by your concept (even while often intellectually comprehending it). It's like seeing life pass in front of you with a scrim between you and happiness that is always "out there" but beyond your reach. Read William Styron's or Andrew Solomon's books on depression.

Melancholy is not synonymous with unhappiness. "Saudade" is a Portuguese term which the writer Manuel de Melo describes as "a pleasure you suffer, an ailment you enjoy." Even heartache which can be experienced as physical pain, is an active state of yearning and not a renunciation of happiness. Maybe a suspension. Happiness is not a linear concept nor can it be understood in quantitative terms.

Good stuff, but some of the flippant comments remind me how little emphasis we actually put on happiness in this country. The increase and dissemination of happiness should be one of our primary policy objectives and as such understanding what we mean by happiness should be of vital interest to everyone. Instead it seems many people consider the whole notion as a sort of joke, presumably saving serious consideration for other objectives, such as GDP. I wonder if that might be one reason we have so many miserable people in the US. Just a thought.

I am usually quite uncomfortable with people who seem very self-satisfied. We all have personal deficiencies; and thus I can not say that "well-being...means living in accordance with your nature." Too many people act as though their "nature" ought to be the norm. And many of these people seem indifferent to the fact that ignorance, stupidity, and prejudice have produced a great deal of unhappiness. I fear that, for many people, happiness means complacency, self-satisfaction, and indifference to the suffering of others.

Yes. We have to make an effort to put ourselves in other people's shoes; it's easier to focus on our own needs. We can cultivate the desire to treat others well, though, and if you do it regularly enough, it becomes second nature.

Or he could be very wise. It depends on whether or not he's made peace with his circumstances. Very ill people often tell researchers they're happier than you would expect. The will to live is deeply ingrained in us, and we can adapt when faced with difficult circumstances.

Boston[April 15, 2014](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/04/13/happiness-and-its-discontents/#permid=11574682)
A thought provoking article but at one point the author said, "Among the most important sources of happiness are: a sense of security; a good outlook; autonomy or control over our lives; good relationships; and skilled and meaningful activity. If you are unhappy, there’s a good chance that it’s for want of something on this list."

However, the Egyptians in the study cited were almost certainly lacking several of these sources of happiness and yet described themselves as "happy." Something amiss with either that study or your proposition. Perhaps both.

We have no ultimate "security" because anything can change in a moment and that's usually how it happens. A "good outlook" reminds me of "positive thinking," which research shows doesn't bring happiness or induce positive outcomes. "Control over our lives" we also know is very limited because we are so shaped by our childhood conditioning (good or bad), habits, heredity, and quite large unconscious processes. "Good relationships" I would agree can be very important sources for emotional well being.

What's the secret? I don't think it's a succession of cold martinis or Cokes on a hot day. I think the best choice on the list is "meaning" & discovering that ultimately we make meaning in our lives in a multitude of diverse ways, but originating from the center or uniqueness of each individual person. Knowing your own heart is key. This is a slow, circuitous process and not very easy in our fast-paced materialistic society.

Babble babble babble. People expect too much of life. If you're alive, walking around under your own power, have enough to eat, some good friends, reasonably interesting work, and good books to read, what's to complain about? And if you're still incapable of feeling happy, you may be dysthymic, so take a pill. Reading the comments, I note a disturbing emphasis on martinis (one of the nastiest drinks ever invented). Martinis cannot make us happy, but chocolate can. Want to be happy? Count your blessings and eat chocolate.

Martinis cannot make *you* happy. They don't make me happy either; I donlt like alcohol. Chocolate just makes you fat and pimply, rots your teeth, cloyingly sweet. A good tangerine or peach, now, that's something. Dare to eat a peach.

A lot of us think a romantic encounter with an attractive woman would make us happy, at least temporarily. Some of us think being married to such a woman would make us happy. Others would settle for ten good minutes. And some of us would rather a man. Or, like Noel Coward's Nina from Argentina who wouldn't tango, 'said she'd rather read a book and that was that.'

The point being that it's fatuous for one person to try to decide what should make another happy.

There seems to be many critics of this article, with the theme of, "This is just pedantics." or, "Seeking happiness is the surest way to not to find it." I also really disagree with the Buddhist notion that one has no power over what happens to them in life and people should simply practice being unaffected by their life circumstances. Hogwash. During my childhood, my dad was a miserable, short-tempered workaholic, married to my mother and living in the suburbs. As a teenager, my parents split, my dad moved to Manhattan and I finally got to meet "the real him": a guy who is funny, analytical, brilliant and deeply satisfied with his life. He looked fundamentally different almost immediately. As a side note, my mother is now remarried and also worlds happier. I took lessons from them and have, so far, had a life full of intentional and rewarding decisions: many of which have been quite unconventional. No one could sell me on the idea that if I were stuck in a job I disliked, unhappily married and spending my life obliged to various dependents, that I could just "train" myself to be unaffected by all those things and be content. Intention, with appropriate follow-up, is a very poweful force.

But lots of things happen to us that we wouldn't choose, like illness or the illness of a family member. Buddhism teaches people to accept the things they can't control, not to be passive with decisions over which we have some agency. That's my understanding, anyway.

It sounds like you're determined not to be like your dad while he was married, and that's fine, but assuming you've got control over everything can make you feel awfully powerless when bad things happen to you.

Dealing with things as they are, rather than wishing things could be different, is the key. Making good choices will only carry you so far.

Reminded me of the idea, that, "a depressed man, lives in a depressed world."

Dear Mr. Haybron,

Your fine essay on 'Happiness' brought to mind a famous historical anecdote when President Charle DeGaulle and his wife were attending a stately dinner in Washington on the occasion of their retirement from Public Life. When Mrs. DeGaulle was asked what she was most looking forward to, she replied: 'A' pennis', causing a silent and awkward pause at the table of guests. Her husband leaned to his wife's ear and said 'Chéri, in America it is pronounced 'Happiness'. Many thanks for bringing the above to your readers.
