## unique.  And  if  you  block  it,  it  will 

## never  exist  through  any  other

About the Bachelor of Performing Arts degree The Bachelor of Performing Arts degree is tailored for students who have interests and abilities in more than one performing art form. 

The degree offers students university-level 

academic tuition alongside some academy-style vocational training, and includes options for a variety of possible study pathways including dance, directing, acting, devising, music performance (singing or instrumental) and composition. The Bachelor of Performing Arts degree is a three-year full-time course of study. It is made up of a minimum of 20 papers. Most of these papers are music, theatre and dance papers, but 

there is sufficient room in the degree to take a minor in another discipline. The BPA is a flexible degree allowing different study pathways and 

multiple specialisations. Auditions are required for singing and/or playing an instrument The Bachelor of Performing Arts is a blended specialist degree that contains practice-based training in some key areas for which students must pass an audition to be accepted. In music, you must choose one or more areas of specialisation, including singing, playing a musical instrument and/or composing/song-writing.

Bachelor of Performing Arts (BPA) at Otago, she thought it was a great opportunity to build on what she loved doing at school. 

Lydia has been involved in performance and 

dance from early on, taking classical vocal training from the age of seven and doing tap-dance, ballet, jazz dance and aerobics. Getting involved in stage challenge and drama was what she enjoyed doing most at school. “The BPA is the perfect course, it’s a mix of the practical and the theoretical. You get the opportunity to perform, and you’re also part of the university, learning and studying academically. There’s not really anywhere else in New Zealand where this kind of course 

is offered. “I was terrified, scared about leaving school for uni and about not making friends. With the BPA 

I’m part of a close-knit community of students 

and staff. You have to get to know people in 

order to perform with them, and I now have a whole lot of friends. 

“The papers in first year all complement each 

other very well, for example, what I learned in my dance paper is helping me with my voice and movement paper. This year I have learned more about myself than I ever have before. I’ve learned about performance, and about how I can better express myself in music, theatre and dance. “This is the perfect course. Everything I loved about school is here, and I have friends with the same interests and helpful, friendly lecturers. It’s hard going, but it doesn’t feel like work, it’s what I want to do.”
