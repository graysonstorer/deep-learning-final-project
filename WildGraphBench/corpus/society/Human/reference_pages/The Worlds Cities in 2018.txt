E c o n o m i c & S o c i a l A f f a i r sThe World’s Cities in 2018 

In 2018, an estimated 55.3 per cent of the world’s 

population lived in urban settlements. By 2030, 

urban areas are projected to house 60 per cent 

of people globally and one in every three people 

will live in cities with at least half a million inhab -

itants. Understanding the key trends in urbaniza -

tion likely to unfold over the coming years is cru -

cial to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda 

for Sustainable Development, including Sustain -

able Development Goal 11, to make cities and 

human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and 

sustainable. 

This data booklet highlights current and future 

trajectories of populations in cities around the 

globe, drawing on the population estimates and 

projections published in  World Urbanization 

Prospects: The 2018 Revision . All information is

1The World’s Cities in 2018 

# What is a City ?

Most people can agree that cities are places where large numbers of people live and work; they are hubs of government, commerce and transportation. But how 

best to define the geographical limits of a city is a matter of some debate. So far, no standardized international criteria exist for determining the boundaries of a 

city and often multiple boundary definitions are available for any given city. 

One type of definition, sometimes referred to as the “city proper”, describes a city according to an administrative boundary. A second approach, termed the “urban 

agglomeration”, considers the extent of the contiguous urban area, or built-up area, to delineate the city’s boundaries. A third concept of the city, the “metro -

politan area”, defines its boundaries according to the degree of economic and social interconnectedness of nearby areas, identified by interlinked commerce or 

commuting patterns, for example. 

The choice of how to define a city’s boundaries is consequential 

for assessing the size of its population. In Toronto, Canada, for ex -

ample, approximately 2.6 million people resided within the “city 

proper” according to the 2011 census, but the population of the 

surrounding “urban agglomeration” was almost twice as large, 

at 5.1 million, and the population of the “metropolitan area” was 

larger still, at 5.6 million.* Furthermore, rates of population growth 

differed across the three definitions. Between the 2006 and 2011 

censuses, the population within Toronto’s “city proper” grew at an 

average annual rate of 0.9 per cent, compared to 1.5 per cent for 

the “urban agglomeration” and 1.8 per cent for the “metropolitan 

area”. 

The 2018 revision of  World Urbanization Prospects  (WUP) en -

deavoured wherever possible, given available data, to adhere to 

the “urban agglomeration” concept of cities. Often, however, in or -

der to compile a series of population estimates that was consistent 

for a city over time, the “city proper” or “metropolitan area” con -

cepts were used instead. Of the 1,860 cities with at least 300,000 

inhabitants in 2018 included in WUP, 55 per cent follow the “urban 

agglomeration” statistical concept, 35 per cent follow the “city 

proper” concept and the remaining 10 per cent refer to “metropoli -

tan areas”.

__________ 2 The World’s Cities in 2018 

# The world’s cities are growing in both size and number 

At the turn of the century in 2000, there were 

371 cities with 1 million inhabitants or more 

worldwide. By 2018, the number of cities 

with at least 1 million inhabitants had grown 

to 548* and in 2030, a projected 706 cities will 

have at least 1 million residents. 

Cities with more than 10 million inhabitants 

are often termed “megacities”. Globally, the 

number of megacities is projected to rise from 

33 in 2018 to 43 in 2030. 

In 2018, 48 cities had populations between 5 

and 10 million. By 2030, 10 of these are pro -

jected to become megacities. Projections in -

dicate that 28 additional cities will cross the 5 

million mark between 2018 and 2030, of which 

13 are located in Asia and 10 in Africa. In 2030, 

66 cities are projected to have between 5 and 

10 million inhabitants. 

An overwhelming majority of the world’s cities 

have fewer than 5 million inhabitants. In 2018, 

there were 467 cities with between 1 and 5 

million inhabitants and an additional 598 cities 

with between 500,000 and 1 million inhabit -

ants. By 2030, the number of cities with 1 to 

5 million inhabitants is projected to grow to 

597. A further 710 cities are expected to have 

between 500,000 and 1 million inhabitants in 

2030.

Cities with 1 million inhabitants or more, 2018 and 2030 3The World’s Cities in 2018 

# One in five people worldwide lives in a city with more than 1 million inhabitants 

In 2018, 1.7 billion people—23 per cent of the world’s population— 

lived in a city with at least 1 million inhabitants. In 2030, a projected 

28 per cent of people worldwide will be concentrated in cities with 

at least 1 million inhabitants. 

Between 2018 and 2030, the urban population is projected to in -

crease in all size classes, while the rural population is projected to 

decline slightly. Rural areas were home to 45 per cent of the world’s 

population in 2018, a proportion that is expected to fall to 40 per 

cent by 2030. 

A minority of people reside in megacities—529 million, represent -

ing 6.9 per cent of the world’s population in 2018. Yet, as these cities 

increase in both size and number, they will become home to a grow -

ing share of the population. In 2030, a projected 752 million people 

will live in cities with at least 10 million inhabitants, representing 8.8 

per cent of the global population.

# Delhi will overtake Tokyo as the world’s largest city by 2030 

Between 2018 and 2030, the population of Delhi, India is projected to increase by more than 10 million inhabitants, whereas that of Tokyo, Japan is 

projected to decline by almost 900,000. The two cities are thus expected to change places on the list of the world’s cities ranked by size. Projections 

indicate that the world’s tenth largest city in 2018—Osaka, Japan—will no longer be among the ten largest in 2030. Kinshasa, Democratic Republic 

of the Congo will grow to rank as the tenth most populous city in the world in 2030  .

# Most megacities are located in the global South 

Of the world’s 33 megacities—that is, cities with 10 million inhabitants or more—in 2018, 27 are located in the less developed regions or the “global 

South”. China alone was home to 6 megacities in 2018, while India had 5. 

Nine of the 10 cities projected to become megacities between 2018 and 2030 are located in developing countries. Megacities in 2018 New megacities by 2030 Seoul Hyderabad London Tehran Chengdu Nanjing Ho Chi Minh City Luanda Ahmadabad Dar es Salaam

# The share of the population residing in cities is increasing in all regions 

Population distribution by size class of settlement* and region, 2018 and 2030 

In Northern America, more than half of the population resided in cities with 500,000 inhabitants or more in 2018 and one in five people lived in a city of 

5 million inhabitants or more. Latin America and the Caribbean is the region with the largest proportion of the population concentrated in megacities: 

of the total population of the region in 2018, 14.2 per cent resided in the six cities with 10 million inhabitants or more. In both Africa and Asia, over 

half of the population lived in rural areas in 2018, a share that is declining in both regions. Between 2018 and 2030, the number of cities with 500,000 

inhabitants or more is expected to grow by 57 per cent in Africa and by 23 per cent in Asia. 

*The population of cities with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants is estimated by taking the difference between the total urban population and the population in cities with 

500,000 inhabitants or more. The number of cities with fewer than 500,000 inhabitants is not estimated.

# Most of the world’s fastest growing cities are in Asia and Africa 

Between 2000 and 2018, the populations of the world’s cities with 500,000 inhabitants or more grew at an average annual rate of 2.4 per cent. However, 

36 of these cities grew more than twice as fast, with average growth in excess of 6 per cent per year. Of these, 7 are located in Africa, 28 in Asia (17 in 

China alone) and 1 in Northern America. Among the 36 fastest growing cities, 25 have a long history of rapid population growth, with average annual 

growth rates above 6 per cent for the period 1980-2000. 

Suzhou, China, is the only city among the 36 fastest growing cities that had a population already greater than 1 million in 2000.

# Fifty-two cities have experienced population decline since 2000* 

In some cities, population decline occurred in response to a natural disaster. This has been the case, for example, in New Orleans, United States, which 

lost population after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, and in Sendai, Japan, following the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. Economic contraction has also 

contributed to population decline in some places. For example, Buffalo and Detroit, both located in the United States, experienced population decline 

associated with the loss of industry and jobs. 

In most cases, however, declining or stagnating populations have been associated with persistent low fertility rates, particularly in Europe. The 52 cities 

with declining populations were home to 59 million people in 2018, down from more than 62 million in 2000.

# Most cities are vulnerable to at least one type of natural disaster 

Of the 1,146 cities with at least 500,000 inhabitants in 2018, 679 (59 per cent) were at high risk of exposure to at least one of six types of natural disaster, 

namely cyclones, floods, droughts, earthquakes, landslides and volcanic eruptions.* Taken together, cities of 500,000 inhabitants or more facing high 

risk of exposure to at least one type of natural disaster were home to 1.4 billion people in 2018. 

One hundred and eighty-nine cities—most located along coastlines—were at high risk of exposure to two or more types of natural disaster; 26 cit -

ies—including megacities Manila, Osaka and Tokyo—faced high risk of exposure to three or more types of disaster. 

*Based on analysis of city populations from the 2018 revision of World Urbanization Prospects together with spatial hotspot data reflecting the historical occurrence of six types of natural disaster from Columbia 

University and the World Bank. The natural disaster data include cyclones occurring between 1980 and 2000; floods between 1985 and 2003; droughts between 1980 and 2000; earthquakes between 1976 and 2002; 

and landslides and volcanic eruptions between 1979 and 2000. A city was classified as being at high risk of exposure to a particular type of natural disaster if its location intersected spatial grid cells ranking in the top 

three deciles of the global risk distribution of the frequency of that specific type of natural disaster. More information about the methodology can be found in Gu and others (2015): Risks of exposure and vulnerability 

to natural disasters at the city level: A global overview. Technical Paper No. 2015/2, Population Division, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, United Nations. Available from http://esa.un.org/unpd/wup/Publica -
