Introduction 

This year marks the 30th Anniversary of the first Human Development Report and of the introduction of the 

Human Development Index (HDI). The HDI was published to steer discussions about development progress 

away from GPD towards a measure that genuinely “counts” for people’s lives. 

Introduced by the Human Deve lopment Report Office (HDRO) thirty years ago to provide a simple measure 

of human progress – built around people’s freedoms to live the lives they want to - the HDI has gained 

popularity with its simple yet comprehensive formula that assesses a population ’s average longevity, 

education, and income. Over the years, however, there has been a growing interest in providing a more 

comprehensive set of measurements that capture other critical dimensions of human development. 

To respond to this call, new measure s of aspects of human development were introduced to complement 

the HDI and capture some of the “missing dimensions” of development such as poverty, inequality and 

gender gaps. Since 2010, HDRO has published the Inequality -adjusted HDI, which adjusts a nat ion’s HDI 

value for inequality within each of its components (life expectancy, education and income) and the 

Multidimensional Poverty Index that measures people’s deprivations directly. Similarly, HDRO’s efforts to 

measure gender inequalities began in the 1995 Human Development Report on gender, and recent reports 

have included two indices on gender, one accounting for differences between men and women in the HDI 

dimensions, the other a composite of inequalities in empowerment and well -being. 

This briefing note is organized into six sections. The first section presents information on the country 

coverage and methodology for the 2020 Human Development Report. The next five sections provide 

information about key composite indices of human development: the HDI , the Inequality -adjusted Human 

Development Index (IHDI), the Gender Development Index (GDI), the Gender Inequality Index (GII), and 

the Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI). 

The tables presented in this note depict the state of human development before t he COVID -19 pandemic 

based on available data for 2019 and earlier years. Data reflecting changes caused by the COVID -19 

pandemic and its socioeconomic fallout in 2020 will be available in 2021 and will be presented in tables 

and related analyses of the 202 1 Human Development Report. 

It is important to note that national and international data can differ because international agencies 

standardize national data to allow comparability across countries and in some cases may not have access 

to the most recent national data. 2

1- Country coverage and the methodology of the 2020 Human Development Report 

The 2020 Human Development Report presents the 2019 HDI (values and ranks) for 189 countries and 

UN -recognized territories, along with the IHDI for 152 c ountries, the GDI for 167 countries, the GII for 162 

countries, and the MPI for 107 countries. 1

It is misleading to compare values and rankings with those of previously published reports, because of 

revisions and updates of the underlying data and adjust ments to goalposts. Readers are advised to assess 

progress in HDI values by referring to Table 2 (‘Human Development Index Trends’) in the 2020 Human 

Development Report. Table 2 is based on consistent indicators, methodology and time -series data and, 

thus, shows real changes in values and ranks over time, reflecting the actual progress countries have made. 

Small changes in values should be interpreted with caution as they may not be statistically significant due 

to sampling variation. Generally speaking, ch anges at the level of the third decimal place in any of the 

composite indices are considered insignificant. 

Unless otherwise specified in the source, tables use data available to HDRO as of 15 July 2020. All indices 

and indicators, along with technical no tes on the calculation of composite indices, and additional source 

information are available online at  http://hdr.undp.org/en/data 

For further details on how each index is calculated please refer to  Technical Notes 1 -6 and the associated 

background papers available on the Human Development Report website:  http://hdr.undp.org/en/data 

2- Human Development Index (HDI) 

The HDI is a summary measure for assessing long -term progress in three basic dimensions of human 

development: a long and healthy life, access to knowledge and a decent standard of living. A long a nd 

healthy life is measured by life expectancy. Knowledge level is measured by mean years of schooling 

among the adult population, which is the average number of years of schooling received in a life -time by 

people aged 25 years and older; and access to le arning and knowledge by expected years of schooling for 

children of school -entry age, which is the total number of years of schooling a child of school -entry age can 

expect to receive if prevailing patterns of age -specific enrolment rates stay the same thr oughout the child's 

life. Standard of living is measured by Gross National Income (GNI) per capita expressed in constant 2017 

international dollars converted using purchasing power parity (PPP) conversion rates. For more details see 

Technical Note 1 .

To ensure as much cross -country comparability as possible, the HDI is based primarily on international 

data from the United Nations Population Division (the life expectancy data), the United Nations Educational, 

Scientific and Cultural Organization Institu te for Statistics (the mean years of schooling and expected years 

of schooling data) and the World Bank (the GNI per capita data). As stated in the introduction, the HDI 

values and ranks in this year’s report are not comparable to those in past reports bec ause of some revisions 

to the component indicators. To allow for assessment of progress in HDIs, the 2020 Human Development 

Report includes recalculated HDIs from 1990 to 2019 using consistent series of data. 

2.1 - Malta ’s HDI value and rank 

Malta ’s HDI value for 2019 is 0.895 — which put the country in the very high human development category —

positioning it at 28 out of 189 countries and territories. 

Between 1990 and 2019, Malta ’s HDI value increased from 0.752 to 0.895 , an increase of 19.0 percent. 

Ta ble A reviews Malta ’s progress in each of the HDI indicators. Between 1990 and 2019, Malta ’s life 

expectancy at birth increased by 5.6 years, mean years of schooling increased by 3.9 years and expected 

years of schooling increased by 3.2 years. Malta ’s GNI per capita increased by about 94.1 percent between 

1990 and 2019.

2.2 - Assessing progress relative to other countries 

Human development progress, as measured by the HDI, is useful for comparison between two or more 

countries. For instance, during the period between 1990 and 2019 Malta , Lithuania and Cyprus experienced 

different degrees of progress toward increasing their HDIs (see Figure 2). 4

Figure 2: HDI trends for Malta , Lithuania and Cyprus , 1990 -2019 

Malta ’s 2019 HDI of 0.895 is below the average of 0.898 for countries in the very high human development 

group and below the average of 0.911 for countries in European Union . From European Union , Malta is 

compared with Cyprus and Estonia , which have HDIs ranked 33 and 29 , respectively (see Table B) .

3- Inequality -adjusted HDI (IHDI) 

The HDI is an average measure of basic human development achievements in a country. Like all averages, 

the HDI masks inequality in the distribution of human development across the population at the country 

level. The 2010 Human Development Report introduced the IHDI, which takes into account inequality in all 

three dimensions of the HDI by ‘discounting’ each dimension’s average value according to its level of 

inequality. The IHDI is basically the HDI discounted for inequalities. The ‘loss’ in human development due 

to inequality is given by the difference between the HDI and the IHDI, and can be expressed as a 

percentage. As the inequality in a country increases, the loss in human development also increases. We 

also present the coefficient of human inequality as a direct measure of inequality which is an unweighted 

average of inequalities in three dimensions. The IHDI is ca lculated for 152 countries. For more details see 

Technical Note 2 .

Malta ’s HDI for 2019 is 0.895 . However, when the value is discounted for inequality, the HDI falls to 0. 823 ,

a loss of 8.0 percent due to inequality in the distribution of the HDI dimension indices. Cyprus and Estonia 

show losses due to inequality of 9.2 percent and 7.1 percent, respectively. The average loss due to inequality 5

for very high HDI countries is 10.9 percent and for European Union it is 9.2 percent. The Human inequality 

coefficient for Malta is equal to 7.9 percent (see Table C).

4- Gender Development Index (GDI) 

In the 2014 Human Development Report, HDRO introduced a new measure, the GDI, based on the sex -

disaggregated Human Development Index, defined as a ratio of the female to the male HDI. The GDI 

measures gender inequalities in achievement in three basic dimen sions of human development: health 

(measured by female and male life expectancy at birth), education (measured by female and male expected 

years of schooling for children and mean years for adults aged 25 years and older) and command over 

economic resource s (measured by female and male estimated GNI per capita). For details on how the 

index is constructed refer to  Technical Note 3 . Country groups are based on absolute deviat ion from gender 

parity in HDI. This means that the grouping takes into consideration inequality in favour of men or women 

equally. 

The GDI is calculated for 167 countries. The 2019 female HDI value for Malta is 0.877 in contrast with 0.909 

for males, resul ting in a GDI value of 0.966 , placing it in to Group 2.2 In comparison, GDI values for Cyprus 

and Estonia are 0.979 and 1.017 , respectively (see Table D). 

Table D: Malta ’s GDI for 2019 relative to selected countries and groups 

5- Gender Inequality Index (GII) 

The 2010 Human Development Report introduced the GII, which reflects gender -based inequalities in three 

dimensions – reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity. Reproductive health is measured 

by maternal mortality and adolescent birth rates; empowerment is measured by the share of parliamentary 

seats held by women and attainment in secondary and higher education by each gender; and economic

activity is measured by the labour market participation rate for women and men. The GII can be interpret ed 

as the loss in human development due to inequality between female and male achievements in the three 

GII dimensions. For more details on GII please see  Technical Note 4 .

Malta has a GII value of 0.175 , ranking it 40 out of 162 countries in the 2019 index. In Malta , 14.9 percent 

of parliamentary seats are held by women, and 78.7 percent of adult women have reached at least a 

secondary level of education compared to 85.6 percent of their male counterparts. For every 100,000 live 

births, 6.0 women die from pregnancy related causes; and the adolescent birth rate is 12.9 births p er 1,000 

women of ages 15 -19. Female participation in the labour market is 46.0 percent compared to 67.1 for men 

(see Table E). 

In comparison, Cyprus and Estonia are ranked at 21 and 21 , respectively, on this index.

6- Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) 

The 2010 Human Development Report introduced the MPI, which  identifies multiple overlapping 

deprivations suffered by individuals in 3 dimensions: health, education and standard of living. The health 

and education dimensions are based on two indicators each , while standard of living is based on six 

indicators. All the indicators needed to construct the MPI for a country are taken from the same household 

survey. The indicators are weighted to create a deprivation score, and the deprivation scores are computed 

for each individual in the survey.  A deprivation score of 33.3 percent (one -third of the weighted indicators) 

is used to distinguish between the poor and nonpoor. If the deprivation score is 33.3 percent or greater, the 

household (and everyone in it) is c lassified as multidimensionally poor. Individuals with a deprivation score 

greater than or equal to 20 percent but less than 33.3 percent are classified as vulnerable to 

multidimensional poverty.  Finally, individuals with a deprivation score greater than o r equal to 50 percent 

live in severe multidimensional poverty. 

Since 2018, HDRO and the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative jointly produce and publish 

the MPI estimates. The latest release from July 2020 covers 107 developing countries ( coun tries that lack 

survey data that allow for the calculation of the MPI are not included ): ‘ Charting pathways out of 

multidimensional poverty: Achieving the SDGs ’ ( also available in  French  and  Spanish ). Definitions of 

deprivations in each indicator, as well as methodology of the MPI are given in  Technical note 5 . Continuing 

with the practice from the previous years, HDRO is making public the statistical programs used in the 

calculation of the 2 020 MPI for a large selection of countries (see  http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/mpi -

statistical -programmes ). Due to a lack of relevant data, the MPI has not been calculated for this c ountry .
