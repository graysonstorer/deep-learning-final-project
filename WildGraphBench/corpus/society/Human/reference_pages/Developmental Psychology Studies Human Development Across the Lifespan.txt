Developmental psychologists focus on human growth and changes across the lifespan, including physical, cognitive, social, intellectual, perceptual, personality and emotional growth.

Understanding Developmental Psychology

The study of developmental psychology is essential to understanding how humans learn, mature and adapt.

Throughout their lives, humans go through various stages of development. Developmental psychologists study how people grow, develop and adapt at different life stages. They conduct research designed to help people reach their full potential — for example, [studying the difference between learning styles in babies and adults](https://www.apa.org/action/careers/improve-lives/alison-gopnik.aspx "Alison Gopnik").

Developmental Psychology Applied

Developmental psychologists study human growth and development over the lifespan, including physical, cognitive, social, intellectual, perceptual, personality and emotional growth.

Developmental psychologists working in colleges and universities tend to focus primarily on research or teaching. Others working in more applied settings like health care facilities or clinics help to assess, evaluate and treat people living with developmental disabilities. Developmental psychologists may also work in assisted living homes for the elderly, hospitals, mental health clinics and centers for the homeless.
