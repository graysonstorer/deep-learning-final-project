The forgotten revolution : how science was born in 300 BC and why it had to be reborn
=====================================================================================

Author: [Lucio Russo](https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=au=%22Russo%2C%20Lucio%22)

Summary: "In the age of Archimedes and Euclid (third century B.C.) science as we know it was born, and gave rise to sophisticated technology that would not be seen again until the 18th century. This scientific revolution was accompanied by great changes in many other fields, such as art and medicine. What were the landmarks of this enormous cultural shift? Why are they so little known today? How to they relate to the post-1500 science that we are familiar with? What led to the end of ancient science? These are the questions that this book discusses, in the belief that the answers bear on choices we face today."--Jacket
