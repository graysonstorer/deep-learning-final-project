# Earliest domestication of common millet (Panicum miliaceum) in East Asia extended to 10,000 years ago

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631)Abstract
----------------------------------------------------------------

The origin of millet from Neolithic China has generally been accepted, but it remains unknown whether common millet (_Panicum miliaceum_) or foxtail millet (_Setaria italica_) was the first species domesticated. Nor do we know the timing of their domestication and their routes of dispersal. Here, we report the discovery of husk phytoliths and biomolecular components identifiable solely as common millet from newly excavated storage pits at the Neolithic Cishan site, China, dated to between _ca._ 10,300 and _ca._ 8,700 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP). After _ca._ 8,700 cal yr BP, the grain crops began to contain a small quantity of foxtail millet. Our research reveals that the common millet was the earliest dry farming crop in East Asia, which is probably attributed to its excellent resistance to drought.

Foxtail millet (_Setaria italica_) and common millet (or broomcorn millet; _Panicum miliaceum_) were among the world's most important and ancient domesticated crops. They were staple foods in the semiarid regions of East Asia (China, Japan, Russia, India, and Korea) and even in the entire Eurasian continent before the popularity of rice and wheat ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B1)–[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B4)), and are still important foods in these regions today ([5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B5), [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B6)).

Thirty years ago, the world's oldest millet remains, dating to _ca._ 8,200 calibrated years before present (cal yr BP), were discovered at the Early Neolithic site of Cishan, northern China. The site contained >50,000 kg of grain crops stored in the storage pits ([7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B7)–[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B9)). Until now, the importance of these findings has been constrained by limited taxonomic identification with regard to whether they are from foxtail millet (_S. italica_) or common millet (_P. miliaceum_), because the early reported _S. italica_ identifications are not all accepted ([4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B4), [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B9)–[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B12)). This article presents the phytoliths, biomolecular records, and new radiocarbon dating from newly excavated grain crop storage pits at the Cishan site. Large modern reference collections are used to compare and contrast microfossil morphology and biomolecular components in different millets and related grass species ([13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B13)). The renewed investigations show that common millet agriculture arose independently in the semiarid regions of China by 10,000 cal yr BP. Our findings contribute to our knowledge of agricultural origins across the globe and have broader implications for understanding the development of human societies.

The Cishan site (36°34.511′ N, 114°06.720′ E) is located near the junction between the Loess Plateau and the North China Plain at an elevation of 260–270 m above sea level ([Fig. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F1)). The archaeological site, containing a total of 88 storage pits with significant quantities (≈109 m 3) of grain crop remains, was excavated from 1976 to 1978 ([7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B7), [8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B8)). Each storage pit included 0.3- to 2-m-thick grain crops, which were well preserved and found in situ in the 3- to 5-m-deep loess layer ([9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B9)). All grain remains have been oxidized to ashes soon after they were exposed to air. Archaeological excavations also revealed the remains of houses and numerous millstones ([Fig. S1](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/data/0900158106/DCSupplemental/Supplemental_PDF#nameddest=SF1)), stone shovels, grind rollers, potteries, rich faunal remains, and plant assemblages including charred fruits of walnut (_Juglans regia_), hazel (_Corylus heterophylla_), and hackberry (_Celtis bungeana_) ([7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B7)–[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B9)). Only 2 14 C dates of charcoal from previously excavated H145 and H48 storage pits yielded uncalibrated ages of 7355 ± 100 yr BP and 7235 ± 105 yr BP, respectively ([8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B8)). These remains represent the earliest evidence for the significant use of dry-farming crop plants in the human diet in East Asia. They also suggest that by this time agriculture had already been relatively well developed here.

Locality map. (_A_) Map showing the location of Cishan and other important Early Neolithic millet agricultural sites in the semiarid region of northeastern China. (_B_) The Cishan site is located on a terrace of the Ming River (_Inset_). A detailed plan of the west area of Cishan site excavated in 1976–1978, showing the outlines of the serried storage pits and the 5 newly excavated storage pits, CS-I to CS-V (numbers in brackets), in an area to the northwest of the earlier excavation is presented. (_C_) A photograph of the newly excavated storage pit CS-V, found on the cliff of the northern terrace. (_D_) Close-up photograph of the loose layer of grain crop remains in storage pit CS-III found in situ in the loess layer.

Early identification assumed these grain crop remains to be foxtail millet (_S. italica_). This preliminary identification was mainly based on a characteristic of very small sizes of grain crop ash (no charred grains)—often <2–3 mm in length—that resembled the foxtail millets ([Fig. S2](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/data/0900158106/DCSupplemental/Supplemental_PDF#nameddest=SF2)), but without any spodogram evidence for the grain crop remains in the Cishan site ([7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B7)–[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B10)). These have been reported as the world's oldest foxtail millet in the literature ([6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B6), [9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B9), [10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B10), [14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B14)). However, the millet identification has been questionable ([4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B4), [11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B11), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B12), [15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B15)), because the macro (ash) remains were too friable to be observed under the microscope. Furthermore, very little study has been conducted on the spodograms or phytoliths of modern millets, so no clear diagnostic feature has been used to distinguish foxtail millet from common millet ([12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B12), [16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B16)). Previous study has also considered at some length how the charred dehusked grains of various native millet species might have been systematically misidentified ([3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B3)). Thus, questions remain regarding whether the Cishan grain crops are from foxtail millet or common millet, or both, because they cannot be distinguished from the ash vestige ([11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B11), [12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B12)).

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631)Results
---------------------------------------------------------------

Phytoliths and biomolecular components have provided substantial empirical evidence demonstrating the considerable antiquity of food production and crop dispersals in many regions of the world ([17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B17)–[20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B20)). Based on our observation and statistics of the variation of anatomy and silicon structure patterns in the glumes, lemmas, and paleas occurring in modern cultivated millets and related grass species collected from different regions in China ([13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B13)), we found that 5 key diagnostic characteristics in phytolith morphology could be used to distinguish between foxtail millet and common millet ([13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B13)): (_i_) a cross-shaped type phytolith is formed in the lower lemma and glume of _S. italica_, whereas a bilobe-shaped type is formed in those of _P. miliaceum_; (_ii_) regularly arranged papillae on the surface of the upper lemma and paleas are peculiar to _S. italica_; (_iii_) the epidermal long cell walls are Ω-undulated in _S. italica_ ([Fig. 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F2)_H_), and η-undulated in _P. miliaceum_ ([Fig. 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F2)_B_, _D_, and _F_); (_iv_) the endings structures of epidermal long cells are cross-wavy type in _S. italica_ and cross-finger type in _P. miliaceum_; the _R_ value (ratio of the width of endings interdigitation to the amplitude of undulations) is higher (0.79 ± 0.12; _n_ = 3,303) in _P. miliaceum_ than in _S. italica_ (0.33 ± 0.11; _n_ = 2,774); and (_v_) surface ridgy line sculpture of the upper lemma is peculiar to _S. italica._ These 5 diagnostic characteristics used together give the only reliable way of distinguishing foxtail millet from common millet when only powder remains are available. In addition, a species-specific identification of phytoliths is possible for _S. italica_ and _P. miliaceum_ because they have typically well-defined silica skeletons that are distinguishable from those in _Panicum bisulcatum_, _Setaria viridis_, and _Setaria plicata_, which have no such demonstrable patterns ([13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B13)).

Also plotted are the fossil samples of husk phytoliths from CS-I-V and BWG, interpreted to be of _P. miliaceum_ origin, dated between _ca._ 10,300 and _ca._ 7,500 yr BP. The CS-II, V, and BWG samples contained 0.4–2.83% Ω-type husk phytoliths, interpreted to be of _S. italica_ origin, dated to less than _ca._ 8,700 yr BP.

To determine the taxa of foxtail millet and common millet, we analyzed the phytoliths of 46 grain crop samples stored in 5 newly excavated storage pits (CS-I to CS-V) at the Cishan site, and 1 sample (BWG) preserved in a storage bottle from the Culture Museum of Cishan. These grain crop samples are dated between _ca._ 10,300 and _ca._ 7,500 cal yr BP based on new 14 C dating measurements ([Fig. 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F3), [Table S1](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/data/0900158106/DCSupplemental/Supplemental_PDF#nameddest=ST1)).

All 47 archaeological samples we analyzed contained abundant diagnostic husk phytoliths that can be divided into 2 groups according to their phytolith assemblages and 14 C dating results. The first group, including 27 samples from CS-I, III, and IV, is dated between _ca._ 10,300 and _ca._ 8,700 cal yr BP. All of the husk phytoliths present are diagnostic of common millet based on their shapes, η patterns ([Fig. 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F2)_A_, _C_, and _E_), and average _R_ value (>0.7) ([Fig. 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F2)_I_). The second group, including 20 samples from CS-II, V, and BWG, is dated between _ca._ 8700 and _ca._ 7,500 cal yr BP. More than 97% of the husk phytoliths are also diagnostic of the common millet (97.2% for CS- II, _n_ = 1,273; 97.5% for CS-V, _n_ = 1,000; 99.6% for BWG, _n_ = 1,000), but a small quantity (0.4–2.8%) of the husk phytoliths in the second group can be attributed to _S. italica_ ([Fig. 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F2)_G_ and _I_).

[Fig. 4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F4) shows that the CS-I storage pit contains ≈1.5-m-thick grain crop remains composed of 3 prominent layers of lemma and palea from common millets alternating with 3 glume plus reed layers. This storage manner indicates that prehistoric humans had known how to preserve large volumes of grains in secure storage. They did so by digging deep storage pits in the dry loess strata and by covering the floors with thick mats of millet glumes and reed (_Phragmites australis_) leaves.

Percentage diagram of 4 phytolith types in CS-I, showing 3 prominent layers of lemma and palea phytoliths from common millets alternating with 3 layers of mixed common millet glumes, reed, and panicoid types. Three radiocarbon dates were obtained from the grain crops. Ages shown are dendro-corrected calendar years BP. Minor age reversal is attributed to the intrusion of roots from the modern grasses growing on the cliff foot face.

Identification of biomolecular components was mainly based on our modern reference collection. A recent study has used the biomolecular components of _P. miliaceum_, the only miliacin-exclusive producer reported, as a basis for identification ([20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B20)). However, because of the lack of comparable data derived from _S. italica_, previous investigators are still not clear how to use biomarkers to distinguish _P. miliaceum_ from _S. italica_. In this study, we examined biomolecular components in 6 samples of modern Paniceae (see _Materials and Methods_). The results show that biomolecular components can be used to distinguish between _P. miliaceum_ and _S. italica_ based on the presence or absence of 5 biomarkers—miliacin, α-amyrin methyl ether (ME), and 3 pentacyclic triterpene methyl ethers (PTMEs), although the structures of the 3 PTMEs have yet to be confirmed ([Fig. 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F5), [Fig. S3](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/data/0900158106/DCSupplemental/Supplemental_PDF#nameddest=SF3)). The total ion current trace shows the whole distribution of aromatic hydrocarbons and ethers extracted from _P. miliaceum_ ([Fig. 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F5)_A_) and _S. italica_ ([Fig. 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F5)_B_) to be in the 54- to 62-min analysis time range. The significant relative abundance of miliacin (compound **2**) ([Fig. 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F5)_D_) was found in both modern species (89.0 ± 1.64% for _P. miliaceum_ and 33.8 ± 22.2% for _S. italica_); the miliacin relative abundances in the aromatic hydrocarbons and ethers were estimated by measuring the area of the miliacin peak on the _m_/_z_ 189 + 204 + 218 ion-specific chromatogram. However, compounds **1**, **4**, and **5** are peculiar to _P. miliaceum_, and compound **3** is peculiar to _S. italica._

Mass spectra of PTME-2 (miliacin, olean-18-en-3β-ol ME) are presented in _D_.

[Fig. 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F5) shows that the prominent compound products of the archaeological samples (BWG, CS-V-03) are compounds **1**, **2**, **4**, and **5**, which are also present in _P. miliaceum_. However, compounds **1**, **4**, and **5** are notably absent from _S. italica_, which contain compounds **2** and **3** only. Thus, the distribution pattern of major biomarkers of BWG and CS-V-03 grain crop remains is similar to that of modern common millet ([Fig. 5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F5)_A_). In 2 archeological samples, including BWG and CS-V-03, the relative abundance of miliacin reaches 88.5% and 88.2%, respectively, which is also very similar to that of common millet. These results provide further support to our conclusion and suggest that common millet is an important source of grain crops stored in the storage pits.

------------------------------------------------------------------

According to archeobotanical research, the early charred grains of common millet occurred during the initial stages of various Early Neolithic sites ([Fig. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F1)), including Dadiwan (_ca._ 7.8–7.35 cal kyr BP) ([21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B21)), Xinglonggou (_ca._ 8.0–7.5 cal kyr BP) ([22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B22)), and Yuezhuang (_ca._ 7.87 cal kyr BP) ([23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B23)) in North China, but foxtail millet was barely present during these stages. Lee et al. ([24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B24)) have speculated that the Early Neolithic predominance of broomcorn over foxtail millet at Xinglonggou and Yuezhuang _ca._ 6000 cal B.C. might be a regional phenomenon, implying that broomcorn millet might have been domesticated earlier than foxtail millet. Our analytical results of both phytoliths and biomolecular components have established that the earliest cereal remains stored in the Cishan Neolithic sites, during _ca._ 10,300–8,700 cal yr BP, are not foxtail millet, but only common millet. After 8,700 cal yr BP, the grain crops gradually contained 0.4–2.8% foxtail millet. Our study also suggests that common millet was used as a staple food significantly earlier than foxtail millet in northern China. It provides direct evidence to show that, by 10,000 cal yr BP, the early people in northern China had developed various methods of maintenance and multiplication of millet seeds for the next generation, and had known how to store crops of staple food in secure, dry places of storage pits during the Early Neolithic epoch.

Common millet has the lowest water requirement among all grain crops; it is also a relatively short-season crop, and could grow well in poor soils ([5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B5), [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B6), [25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B25)). The geographical distribution of both foxtail millet and common millet in China ([Fig. S4](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/data/0900158106/DCSupplemental/Supplemental_PDF#nameddest=SF4)) shows that foxtail millet is more common in the semiwet eastern areas, and its optimal growth occurs at mean annual temperature (MAT) from 8 to 10 °C and mean annual precipitation (MAP) from 450 to 550 mm. However, common millet is more adapted to the drier interior areas, and its optimal growing conditions occur at MAT from 6 to 8 °C and MAP from 350 to 450 mm ([5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B5), [6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B6)). The origin and dispersal of millet agriculture is a key problem closely related to the history of human impact on the environment and transformation of natural vegetation.

Paleoenvironmental data from the Weinan section ([26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B26)–[29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B29)) ([Fig. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F1)) in the southern part of the Loess Plateau between the Cishan and Dadiwan sites are crucial for understanding the early stage of the forager–cultivator transition. The early Holocene was a period of significant environmental change marked by dry climate conditions as inferred from sediment texture ([26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B26), [28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B28)), magnetic susceptibility ([26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B26), [28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B28)), pollen ([27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B27)), phytoliths ([28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B28)), and mollusk assemblages ([29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B29)). These proxy records show an environmental transition from cold–dry (_ca._ 11,000–8,700 cal yr BP) to warm–wet (_ca._ 8,700–5,500 cal yr BP) conditions. Many lacustrine and loess records from the Chinese Loess Plateau to Central Asia also support the scenario of a dry climate during the early Holocene ([30](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B30)–[34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B34)). Under the drier climate conditions, soil development was slowed, and the soil developed on the underlying older and coarser loess of the glacial period was poor in nutrients ([28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B28)). This raises the possibility that common millet was more significant than foxtail millet in the early stages of food production in North China because it was more adaptable than foxtail millet to the dry condition prevailing during the early Holocene. The common millet cultivation may involve complex selection by natural forces and human activities, although no clear evidence has been documented in this region for the transitions from gathering to cultivation and/or from a wild ancestor to domesticated common millet ([1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B1), [2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B2), [5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B5)).

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631)Conclusions
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Our research indicates that the earliest significant common millet cultivation system was established in the semiarid regions of China by 10,000 cal yr BP, and that the relatively dry condition in the early Holocene may have been favorable for the domestication of common millet over foxtail millet. Our study shows that common millet appeared as a staple crop in northern China ≈10,000 years ago, suggesting that common millet might have been domesticated independently in this area and later spread to Russia, India, the Middle East, and Europe. Nevertheless, like Mesopotamia, where the spread of wheat and barley to the fertile floodplains of the Lower Tigris and Euphrates was a key factor in the emergence of civilization, the spread of common millet to the more productive regions of the Yellow River and its tributaries provided the essential food surplus that later permitted the development of social complexity in the Chinese civilization.

### Phytolith Extraction from Archaeological Material.

The Cishan site is located on the north terrace of the Ming River ([Fig. 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#F1)). The geography of this region consists of alluvial terraces covered by loess deposits. Five storage pits (CS-I to CS-V) are situated on the edge of the terrace. The terrace is composed of thick sediments (4–5 m thick for CS-I to CS-IV, 11 m thick for CS-V) that consist of alternating layers of loess and soil. Each of the storage pits (CS-I to CS-V) contains ≈1- to 2-m-thick grain crop remains, being well preserved in the 3- to 5-m-deep loess layer ([Table S1](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/data/0900158106/DCSupplemental/Supplemental_PDF#nameddest=ST1)).

A total of 46 samples from 5 storage pits (CS-I to CS-V) at the Cishan site and 1 sample (BWG) from the Culture Museum of Cishan were analyzed. Of these, 16 continuous samples were taken at 10-cm intervals from CS-I storage pit. The samples were prepared according to the procedure slightly modified from Piperno ([35](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B35), [36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B36)) and Lu et al. ([37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2678631#B37)). It consists of sodium pyrophosphate (Na 4 P 2 O 7) deflocculation, treatment with 30% hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) and cold 15% hydrochloric acid (HCl), zinc bromide (ZnBr 2; density, 2.35 g/cm 3) heavy liquid separation, and mounting on a slide with Canada balsam. Phytolith counting and identification were performed by using a Leica microscope with phase-contrast and microscopic interferometer at 400× magnification.

### Millet Molecule Extractions from Modern Plants and Archaeological Material.

We examined modern millet molecules from 6 domesticated samples of Paniceae, including 3 samples of _Setaria italica_ L. Beauv. (foxtail millet) and 3 samples of _Panicum miliaceum_ L. (common millet). Two archaeological samples of grain crop remains, including 1 sample from CS-V storage pit and 1 sample (BWG) in a storage bottle from the Culture Museum of Cishan, were analyzed.

One gram of each of dried sample (smaller than 100 mesh) was ultrasonically extracted for 3 times with a mixture of acetone and pentane at 1:1 (vol/vol). After filtration, the mixture was eluted with _n_-hexane to give aliphatic hydrocarbons (N). Using dichloromethane in _n_-hexane passing through the column resulted in satisfactory separation of aromatic hydrocarbons and ethers (A). The extracted subfractions (A) were then analyzed by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS) .

GC-MS was conducted by using an Agilent 6890 N GC-5973 N MSD mass selective detector system (EI 70 eV; ion source temperature, 230 °C) fitted with a fused silica chemically bonded capillary column (J&W DB-5; 0.25 mm in diameter, 30 m long, 0.25 μm film thickness). Each sample was injected onto the column at 280 °C in the splitless mode. After a 1-min isothermal hold at 50 °C, the column temperature was increased by 30 °C/min to 120 °C; and then 3 °C/min to 290 °C, successively, with a 30-min isothermal hold at 290 °C. The flow rate of the helium carrier gas was 1.2 mL/min (40 cm/sec).

Compounds were identified by their retention time within the gas chromatograph, their fragmentation pattern within the mass spectrometer, and by matching their mass spectra to reference spectra from the literature or from libraries (NIST02L). The miliacin relative abundances were estimated by measuring the area of the miliacin peak on the _m_/_z_ 189 + 204 + 218 ion-specific chromatogram. Note that this value may vary under different GC/MS conditions, and there will be a small change in the abundance of this ion.
