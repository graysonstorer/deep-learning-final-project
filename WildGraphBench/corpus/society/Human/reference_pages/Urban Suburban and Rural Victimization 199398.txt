# Urban, Suburban, and Rural Victimization, 1993–98

Detis T. Duhart, Ph.D. BJS Statistician Violent and property crime victimization disproportionately affected urban residents during 1998. Urbanites accounted for 29% of the U.S. popula-tion and sustained 38% (12 million) of all violent and property crime victimizations. In comparison, the percentages of suburban and rural residents who were victims of crime were lower than their percentages of the population. Fifty-one percent of the U.S. population were suburban residents who experi-enced 47% (15 million) of all violent and property victimizations. Rural residents accounted for 20% of the U.S. population but sustained 15% (5 million) of all violent and property crime victimizations, according to National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data. During 1998 urban residents experi-enced overall violent crime, rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault, and personal theft at higher rates than suburban or rural residents. Urban households also sustained overall property crime, burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft at higher rates than suburban or rural households.

October 2000, NCJ 182031 Data and measurement 

This report presents findings based on NCVS data collected by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). The NCVS gathers data about crimes from an ongoing, nationally representative sample of households in the United States. NCVS data include information about crime victims (age, gender, race, ethnicity, marital status, income, and educational level), criminal offenders (gender, race, approximate age, and victim-offender relationship), and the nature of the crime (time and place of occurrence, use of weapons, nature of injury, and victims’ reaction to attack). Homicide data are collected by the FBI, under the Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR). Geographic areas in this report are based on Metropolitan Areas (MA’s). The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) classifies areas into three segments based on their relation-ship to an MA: central city, outside central city, and nonmetropolitan area. These classification categories are labeled in this report as urban, subur-ban, and rural, respectively. 1

Urban, suburban, and rural victimization, 1998 

Victimization theorists and practitioners argue that victimization rates are related to locality of residence. The results of these analyses are consis-tent with previous studies that examined victimizations by locality of occurrence (table 1). Urban areas generally experienced criminal victimi-zations at rates higher than suburban or rural areas in 1998. Violent crimes Urban residents experienced overall violent crime at a higher rate than suburban or rural residents during 1998. Violent victimization rates for urbanites, suburbanites, and rural residents were 48, 37, and 28 per 1,000 persons, respectively. Similar results were found for all categories of violent crime (rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault) with two exceptions. Urban residents’ simple assault rate was slightly higher than suburban residents’ rate, and rape and sexual assault rates were similar across all areas during 1998. Urban, suburban, and rural residents’ simple assault rates were almost triple the rates of any other violent crime (figure 1). Personal thefts Urbanites were victims of personal theft at a significantly higher rate than suburbanites. The urban personal theft rate was twice the rate experienced by suburban residents (2 versus 1 per 1,000 residents). Property crimes During 1998 urban households were characterized by a higher overall property crime rate than were subur-ban or rural households. For example, urban households’ property crime rate was 36% higher than suburban house-holds and 57% higher than rural households (271 urban, 199 suburban, and 173 rural property crimes per 1,000 households, respectively). In addition, urban households experi-enced burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft at higher rates than house-holds in other areas. Theft rates were higher than burglary or motor vehicle theft rates in all areas (figure 2). 2Urban, Suburban, and Rural Victimization, 1993-98 Note: The 1998 urban 12 or older population was 65,513,700, suburban 112,589,800, and rural 44,528,200. The 1998 total number of urban households was 32,546,700, suburban 52,545,400, and rural 20,757,300. Violent crime and personal theft rates are per 1,000 persons; property crime rates are per 1,000 households. *Based on 10 or fewer sample cases. 132.9 158.6 207.6 Theft 3.6 9.7 16.4 Motor vehicle theft 36.6 31.0 47.4 Household burglary 173.1 199.3 271.4 Property crimes *0.3 1.0 2.0 Personal theft 19.3 25.4 29.3 Simple assault 4.9 7.2 10.2 Aggravated assault 2.3 3.2 6.2 Robbery 1.3 1.4 1.8 Rape and sexual assault 27.8 37.2 47.6 Violent crimes Rural Suburban Urban Number of victimizations per 1,000 persons or households

Victimization rates are declining. Violent crime, personal theft, and property crime rates fell between 1993 and 1998. The trends in violent and property crime for urban and suburban areas were similar, decreasing at a greater rate than in rural areas (see appendix table 1 for populations). Violent crimes Violent victimization rates fell for residents in urban, suburban, and rural areas between 1993 and 1998 (figure 3). There were 74 urban violent victimizations (per 1,000 urbanites) in 1993 compared to 48 in 1998 & a36% decrease. Suburbanites experi-enced violent crime victimization at a rate about 25% lower in 1998 than in 1993 (37 compared to 50 per 1,000 suburbanites). During the same period, rural victimization rates fell significantly (34%) from 42 to 28 per 1,000 rural residents. The percent decrease in violent crime victimization between 1993 and 1998 for urban residents was higher than that experi-enced in suburban and rural areas. In all types of localities, aggravated and simple assault rates were lower in 1998 than they were in 1993 (table 2). Urban and rural residents experienced rape and sexual assault at significantly lower rates; suburban residents at somewhat lower rates. Urban and suburban robbery rates fell between 1993 and 1998, while rural robbery rates remained similar. Homicide From 1976 to 1998 changes in homicide trends were driven by changes in the number of homicides in large American cities (defined as cities with populations of 100,000 or more). Over half of the homicides during this period occurred in large cities; almost a quarter of the homicides occurred in cities with a population of more than 1 million (figure 4). Small cities are defined as those with a population of less than 100,000. Personal thefts Urban and suburban personal theft (pocket picking or purse snatching) rates declined from 1993 to 1998 (figure 5).

experienced more than twice the rate of personal theft than they experienced in 1998 (5 versus 2 personal thefts per 1,000 urbanites). For suburbanites, personal theft rates fell 41% between 1993 and 1998 (2 versus 1 personal theft per 1,000 suburbanites). Property crimes On average, urban, suburban, and rural property crime rates were 33% lower in 1998 than they were in 1993 (figure 6). Specifically, urban rates fell 34%, suburban rates 35%, and rural rates 31%. For each category of property crime, burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft, rates were lower in 1998 than in 1993, regardless of type of locality consid-ered (table 3). Urban household rates of burglary and motor vehicle theft declined more than suburban or rural household rates. 

Average annual urban, suburban, and rural victimization, 1993-98 

Violent crime Individuals living in urban areas were victims of overall violent crime, rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggra-vated assault, and simple assault at rates significantly higher than for those living in suburban or rural areas (table 4). The average annual overall violent crime rate in urban areas was about 74% higher than the average rural rate and 37% higher than the average suburban rate. In all localities rates for robbery, aggra-vated assault, and simple assault in which no injuries occurred were higher than rates for these same offenses resulting in injuries. Personal theft On average, urban residents experi-enced personal theft at higher rates than suburban or rural residents (3 versus 2 and 1 per 1,000, respectively). Purse snatchings and pocket pickings were completed at a rate of 3 per 1,000 urban residents, twice the suburban rate, and 4 times the rural rate. Property crime Urban households experienced overall property crime at rates significantly higher than those for other households. Burglaries were sustained among urban households at rates higher than rural households (46 per 1,000), which in turn experienced burglaries at rates higher than suburban households (40 per 1,000). Urban households also experienced thefts at higher rates than suburban households. A higher percentage of suburban and rural households owned motor vehicles than did urban households (96%, 95%, and 87%, respectively). The percent-age of completed motor vehicle thefts was highest among rural households (79% in rural areas, 66% in urban areas, and 69% in suburban areas).

The same groups were also most susceptible to victimization in urban, suburban, and rural areas (table 5). Gender Urban males and females were violently victimized at rates higher than males and females in other areas. Across all areas of interest, urban male violent victimization rates were the highest. Stated differently, urban males experienced violent victimiza-tions at a rate 87% higher than rural males and 47% higher than urban females. Race Violent crimes were committed against blacks at rates higher than whites in urban localities. Black urbanites experienced 68 violent victimizations (per 1,000) while urban whites were victimized at a rate of 59 (per 1,000). Suburban blacks experienced violent crime at a rate marginally higher than white suburbanites. Rural residents of other races were twice as likely to be victims of violent crime as were black or white rural residents (68 victimiza-tions compared to 31 and 34 per 1,000 persons, respectively). 2Ethnicity In all areas, violent crime victimization rates among Hispanics were statisti-cally similar. Non-Hispanics in urban areas experienced violent crime at a higher rate than Hispanics (61 versus 52 per 1,000, respectively), while suburban and rural Hispanics sus-tained violence at a higher rate than respective non-Hispanic residents. Annual household income In general regardless of the type of area considered, as annual household income increased, violent victimization rates decreased. Persons with house-hold incomes of less than $7,500 in all areas experienced a violent victimi-zation at more than twice the rate of persons with household incomes of $75,000 or more. Urban residents in the highest income category were victims of violent crime more than similar suburban or rural residents. Urban residents in the lowest income category were violently victimized at a rate slightly higher than low-income suburbanites and 41% higher than low-income rural residents. Age Residents younger than 20 years old in all areas experienced violent crime more than all other age groups, while residents age 65 or over experienced violent crime the least of all age groups. In each age group, urbanites were victims of violent crime at rates higher than suburban or rural residents. Marital status In urban and suburban areas, persons who had never married were violently victimized more than those in any other category of marital status. Urban residents, whether never married, married, or widowed, were victimized at higher rates than similar residents in suburban or rural areas. Divorced or separated urbanites were violent crime victims at a rate somewhat higher than similar suburbanites and at a rate higher than rural residents. 

Demographic characteristics of victims of rape and sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault, and simple assault 

In general, regardless of the character-istics, urban residents were victims of all types of violent crimes at higher rates than suburban or rural residents (table 6).

For information about urban, suburban, and rural victimizations among American Indians, see American Indians and Crime, NCJ 173386, February 1999. Gender Urban females were raped or sexually assaulted at rates 53% higher than suburban or rural females. Males were robbed and assaulted more than females in all localities of interest. The rate of aggravated assault against urban males was about twice that of urban females. Race Blacks were robbed and experienced aggravated assault more than whites and persons of other races in urban and suburban areas. In rural areas robbery rates were similar for all races; however, slightly more aggravated assaults occurred among rural blacks than among rural whites. White rural residents were simple assault victims more often than blacks in similar areas. Rural residents of other races were simple assault victims more than white or black rural residents. Annual household income Generally, in all localities, residents with low household incomes experi-enced all categories of violent crime more than residents with high house-hold incomes. For all levels of income, urban residents were robbed more than other residents. Urban and subur-ban residents in the lowest and highest income categories were aggravated assault victims at similar rates. Except for households with incomes between $7,500-$24,999 and $35,000-$49,999, the simple assault rate among urban residents was similar to suburbanites and higher than rural residents .Age In general, in all areas, younger residents were victims of all categories of violent crime at higher rates than older residents. Rape and sexual assault rates among 20-49 year old urbanites were marginally higher than suburbanites’ rates in the same age category. Except for residents age 65 or older, urban residents were robbed and experienced aggravated assaults more than suburban or rural residents. Urban residents younger than age 20 experienced simple assault at rates similar to suburban residents of the same ages, and at higher rates than all other residents, regardless of age. Marital status In all types of localities, residents who never married or were divorced or separated were raped and sexually assaulted, robbed, and assaulted more than people who were married or widowed. Urban robbery rates were higher than suburban or rural rates for all marital categories except among widowed residents.

Demographic characteristics of property crime victims 

Gender Urban households headed by males experienced property crime at a rate about 9% higher than that found among urban households headed by females (table 5). Urban households with male and female heads were victimized at rates significantly higher than equivalent suburban and rural households. Race Black and white households experi-enced property victimization at similar rates whether living in urban or rural areas. Both black and white urban households were victims of property crime at significantly higher rates than black and white suburban and rural households. In suburban areas, blacks experienced property crimes at rates higher than whites. Rural households headed by persons of other races were victims of property crime at higher rates than black or white rural house-holds (343, 200, and 211 per 1,000 households, respectively). Ethnicity Urban households headed by Hispanic or non-Hispanic persons experienced property crime at rates higher than similar suburban or rural households. Regardless of locality, Hispanics were victims of property crime more than non-Hispanics. Annual household income Urban households at all income levels experienced property crime at higher rates, followed by suburban and rural households. For example, the property crime rate for urban households with annual incomes of $25,000-$34,999 was 375 crimes per 1,000 households. Suburban and rural households at this income level had property crime rates of 257 and 225 crimes per 1,000 households, respectively. Age of household head Generally, younger households in all areas of residence were more likely to experience property crimes than households headed by older residents. Urban households headed by persons under age 20 experienced property crimes at more than twice the rate sustained by households headed by persons ages 50-64. Urban house-holds headed by persons age 20 or over were victims of property crime at significantly higher rates than similar suburban or rural households. Marital status of household head Households headed by divorced or separated persons and households headed by persons who never married were victims of property crime at higher rates than households of married or widowed persons regardless of the Urban, Suburban, and Rural Victimization, 1993-98 7*Based on 10 or fewer sample cases.

Urban house-holds were the victims of property crime at higher rates when compared to suburban or rural households for all categories of marital status. 

Demographic characteristics of burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft victims 

In general, households in urban areas experienced overall property crime, burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft, at rates significantly higher than subur-ban or rural households. Gender Female-headed households were burglarized more than male-headed households in all areas of residence (table 7). The burglary rates for rural male- and female-headed households were higher than suburban male- and female-headed household rates (42 rural males and 54 rural females per 1,000 households compared to 37 suburban males and 46 suburban females per 1,000 households). Motor vehicle theft rates were similar for male- and female-headed households in all localities except urban areas; where households headed by males were victims of motor vehicle theft more than households headed by females. Male-headed households experienced theft more than house-holds headed by females in all areas. Race Black households were burglarized and sustained motor vehicle thefts at rates higher than white households in urban and suburban areas, while rural blacks and whites experienced these crimes at similar rates. Theft rates for white households were higher than black household rates in urban areas and somewhat higher in rural areas. Rural households of other races were victims of thefts at rates higher than black or white households. Rural households of other races were burglarized more than white households and slightly more than black households. Annual household Income Households with low incomes were generally burglarized at higher rates than households with higher annual incomes across all areas of residence. Generally, within each type of area, motor vehicle theft rates were similar for all levels of income. However, in all areas of residence, households in high-income categories were generally more likely to be the victims of thefts than households in low-income categories. Age of household head In all areas, households headed by younger persons were generally victims of burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft at rates higher than older households. Except among house-holds headed by persons between the ages of 12-19 years, urban households were the victims of burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft more than suburban or rural households .Marital status of household head In all areas households with heads who never married or those who divorced or separated were burglarized at rates higher than households headed by married or widowed persons. Never married, widowed, and divorced or separated rural households were burglarized more than similar subur-ban households. Motor vehicle theft and theft rates were lowest for widowed households regardless of residence location. Motor vehicle theft and theft rates for suburban house-holds were higher than rural for all categories of marital status except for theft among widowed households. 

Characteristics of victimization 

Many characteristics of crime were similar across all types of locality. Location of residence had very little effect on the time of victimization, victims’ reaction to the attack, type of injury sustained from the victimization, and whether offender used a weapon in the commission of the act. Location of victimization Most violent crimes in urban and suburban areas occurred in open areas, on the street, or on public 8Urban, Suburban, and Rural Victimization, 1993-98 Note: Detail may not add to total shown because of rounding. 11 1,065,190 12 3,463,900 11 2,465,140 Other 3251,200 2660,110 3580,210 Threaten or attacked %86 8,201,580 %85 23,923,990 %87 19,943,370 No threat or attack Victims reaction to attack %100 9,517,960 %100 28,048,000 %100 22,988,720 Total Percent Number Percent Number Percent Number Rural Suburban Urban Rate per 1,000 persons age 12 or older

Table 8. Location and time of violent crime victimization in urban, suburban, and rural areas, 1993-98 transportation. Between 1993 and 1998, more than a quarter (26%) of violent crime victimizations among urban residents, and about a fifth (19%) among suburban residents occurred in these areas (table 8). Rural residents were more likely to be victimized in their homes when compared to other areas where victimi-zations occurred. About 18% of rural victims of violent crime were victimized at their homes compared to urban (15%) or suburban (14%) victimizations. Time of victimization Crimes happened at similar times of the day among residents living in urban, suburban, and rural areas. About half of the violent crime experi-enced by urban (49%), suburban (52%), and rural (51%) residents were committed between 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Around 3 out of 10 violent crimes occurred between 6 p.m. and midnight. Victims’ reaction to attack Most violent crime victims did not defend themselves or their property (no resistance, unarmed confrontation, and non-confrontational tactics) in urban (87%), suburban (85%), and rural (86%) areas (table 9). About 3% of violent crime victims in urban and rural areas compared to 2% of suburban victims defended themselves by threatening or attacking their assail-ant with a firearm or other weapon. Type of injury About 20% of violent crimes in all areas resulted in minor injury; about 5% resulted in serious injury (table 10). Weapons used Most violent offenders were unarmed in every type of locality (60% urban, 68% suburban, and 70% rural). Urban violent offenders were more likely than offenders elsewhere (12% urban versus 9% suburban and 8% rural) to use a firearm. 

Characteristics of offender 

Gender of offender Males were perceived to be the offend-ers of violent crimes more often than females regardless of the area examined (table 11). Males were perceived to have committed 80% of the urban violent victimizations and 79% of suburban and rural violent crimes. Although the percentage of females perceived to have committed violent crimes in suburban and rural areas was similar (16%), the percent-age of females committing violent crimes in suburban areas was signifi-cantly higher than the percentage of females committing violent crimes in urban areas (14%). The percentage of violent crime committed by females in rural areas was slightly higher than the percentage committed by females in urban areas. Race of offender Whites were perceived to be the assailants in violent crime more often than blacks or persons of other races in all types of localities. However, the percentage of whites in the urban, suburban, and rural populations was higher than the percentage of offenses perceived to have been committed by whites in each area. In contrast, the percentage of blacks in all localities was lower than their percentage of violent crime victimizations. For example, between 1993-98, 90% of the rural population was white and whites were perceived to have commit-ted 72% of rural violent victimizations. Although blacks comprised 8% of the Urban, Suburban, and Rural Victimization, 1993-98 9Note: Detail may not add to total shown because of rounding. 17 1,591,250 17 4,751,990 20 4,682,820 Other 5516,810 61,714,880 71,581,750 Knife 8778,370 92,384,300 12 2,854,200 Firearm 70% 6,631,540 68% 19,196,840 %60% 13,869,950 No weapon Weapon used 012,060 027,790 029,310 Other 22 2,100,820 20 5,597,920 21 4,764,550 Minor injury 5452,370 41,072,470 51,161,350 Serious injury 73% 6,952,710 76% 21,349,820 74% 17,033,510 No injury Type of injury 100% 9,517,960 100% 28,048,000 100% 22,988,720 Total Percent Number Percent Number Percent Number Rural Suburban Urban

Table 11. Gender, race, and age of violent crime offenders in urban, suburban, and rural areas, 1993-98 rural population, they were perceived to have committed 16% of rural violent crimes (see appendix table 1 for total populations). Age of offender In all localities, almost two-thirds of the violent crime victims perceived the offender to have been age 18 or older (urban 63%, suburban 62%, and rural 64%). Only about a quarter of violent offenders in all localities was perceived to be younger than age 18. The percentage of suburban and rural crime victims who perceived their offender to be less than 18 was higher than urban victims’ percentage (23% and 24% versus 19%, respectively). Offender substance abuse The percentage of urban and subur-ban violent crime offenders perceived to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs was similar (29%); the percent-age of rural offenders perceived to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs while committing a violent crime (35%) was higher than that in urban or subur-ban areas (table 12). Victim offender relationship In suburban and rural areas, victims were more likely to be victimized by someone they knew than by a stranger (table 13). About 50% of suburban victims and 63% of rural victims knew their offender compared to 47% and 34% of stranger victimization in each respective area. Urban violent crime victims were more likely to be victim-ized by a stranger, accounting for 53% of all urban violent victimizations. 

Who reports to the police 

Gender Females were more likely to report victimizations to the police than males in urban and rural areas (table 14). Suburban males and females reported to the police at similar percentages. Race Urban and suburban blacks reported their victimizations to the police at higher percentages than whites in similar localities. Blacks and whites living in all reported victimizations to the police at similar percentages. Residents of other races were least likely to report being victimized to the police in suburban areas. Ethnicity Hispanics and non-Hispanics reported crimes at similar rates in all localities. Non-Hispanics reported more crime than Hispanics in urban and suburban areas; in rural areas both groups reported at similar percentages. 

What crimes are reported to the police 

In all localities robberies and aggra-vated assaults were the violent crimes most likely to be reported to the police (table 15). Rape and sexual assaults were the least likely to be reported in urban and suburban areas. In rural areas rape and sexual assaults and simple assaults were reported the least. Residents of all localities reported about 3 in 10 personal thefts to the police. Victims of motor vehicle thefts reported their victimization to the police more than any other property crime. Rural residents reported household burgla-ries less than suburban residents and slightly less than urban residents.

Table 14. Urban, suburban, and rural police reporting, by victim characteristic, 1993-98 simple assault, personal theft (purse snatching and pocket picking), house-hold burglary, motor vehicle theft, and theft. Information is obtained from a continuous, nationally representative sample of households in the United States. The sample includes persons living in group quarters, such as dormitories, rooming houses, and religious group dwellings. Crew members of merchant vessels, Armed Forces personnel living in military barracks or temporary housing, and institutionalized persons, such as correctional facility inmates, and hospital or nursing home patients, were not included. Between 1993 and 1998 approximately 293,400 households and 574,000 individuals age 12 or older were inter-viewed about the crimes they experi-enced in the previous 6 months. Yearly response rates for the NCVS data presented varied between 93% and 96% of eligible households and between 89% and 92% of eligible individuals. Estimates for 1998 in this report are obtained about victimizations experi-enced in the same calendar year, called a data year. The data in the BJS Bulletin Criminal Victimization 1998: Changes 1997-98 with Trends 1993-98 were collected during the calendar year being estimated, termed a collection year. Estimates for 1998 in this report and estimates in the Bulletin may differ somewhat because of differences in the two collection methods. Standard error computations for NCVS estimates Comparisons of percentages and rates in this report were tested to determine if differences were statistically signifi-cant. Differences described in the text as higher, lower, or different and changes over time characterized as having increased or decreased passed a hypothesis test at the .05 level of statistical significance (95% confidence level). That is, the tested difference in the estimates was greater than twice the standard error of that difference. For comparisons that were statistically significant at the .10 level of statistical significance (90% confidence level), the terms somewhat different, margin-ally different, or slight difference are used to note the nature of the difference. Caution is required when comparing estimates not explicitly discussed in the text. What may appear to be large differences may not test as statistically significant at the 95% or the 90% confi-dence level. Significance testing calcu-lations were conducted at the Bureau of Justice Statistics using statistical programs developed specifically for the NCVS by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. These programs take into consideration many aspects of the complex NCVS sample design when calculating generalized variance estimates. Trends in violent and property victimization A linear trend test was used to test the change in violent and property crime estimates over time. This test allows one to examine whether, for example, the rate of violent crime victimization decreased (or increased) over time. Based on a regression with, for example, time as the independent variable and violent victimization rate as the dependent variable, the test involves computing the regression coefficient ( b) and its corresponding standard error ( ). The ratio of these two ( b/ ) is the test statistic t. If t is greater than 1.96, the null hypothesis is rejected. In addition, independent sample t tests were conducted on the adjusted yearly rates of victimizations in urban, suburban, and rural areas to Urban, Suburban, and Rural Victimization, 1993-98 11 20,757,300 20,679,000 20,566,400 21,654,400 22,331,600 22,435,700 Rural 52,545,400 51,370,100 50,476,400 48,218,000 46,670,500 46,499,500 Suburban 32,546,700 32,293,900 32,052,700 32,015,900 31,805,600 30,992,200 Urban 105,849,500 104,343,000 103,095,500 101,888,400 100,807,700 99,927,400 Total 1998 1997 1996 1995 1994 1993 Households in the population 277,274,400 44,528,200 44,456,700 44,300,200 46,938,300 48,645,100 48,406,000 Rural 640,558,200 112,589,800 110,750,000 109,158,700 104,864,100 101,764,100 101,431,600 Suburban 384,181,400 65,513,700 65,226,800 64,508,500 63,907,100 63,338,100 61,687,200 Urban 1,302,014,100 222,631,700 220,433,500 217,967,400 215,709,500 213,747,300 211,524,800 Total 1993-98 1998 1997 1996 1995 1994 1993 Persons in the population

Calculation of rates and annual levels Except as noted, the rates in this report are average annual rates for 1993-98. The numerator of a given number is the sum of crimes that occurred for each year from 1993 through 1998; the denominator is the sum of the annual population of persons or households for these years (or the number falling within the particular demographic group being measured). These numbers are multiplied by 1,000 to obtain the average annual rates. Average annual levels of criminal victimization are obtained by summing the number of victimizations between 1993 and 1998 and dividing by six. Population totals used in this report are calculated from estimates derived from the NCVS (appendix table 1). Included in the population are persons age 12 or older living in the households, including group quarters such as dormitories. Population estimates do not include children less than age 12, institutional-ized persons, U.S. citizens living aboard, crew members of merchant vessels, and Armed Forces personnel living in military barracks. The percent-ages are calculated using the method similar to the one used for average annual rates. Homicide data Homicide data presented in this report are collected by the FBI, under the Supplementary Homicide Reports (SHR) of the Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR). The homicide data provide incident-level data on about 92% of the homicides in the United States, including the victim and offender relationship. 12 Urban, Suburban, and Rural Victimization, 1993-98 The Bureau of Justice Statistics is the statistical agency of the U.S. Department of Justice.
