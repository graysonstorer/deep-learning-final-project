# Human weight

### From ArticleWorld

**Human weight** is a measurement (made in pounds, kilograms or stones) that factors into an individual’s overall health. One’s weight, if in excess, is a contributor to the risk for heart disease. If one’s weight is too low, due to problems such as malnutrition, anorexia or bulimia, metabolic and other health risks are possible.

Normal values
-------------

The average weight value for males is between 168 and 183 pounds (76-83 kg). The average weight of teen males is 99-141 pounds (45-64 kg). For females, the average weight in adults is 54-64 kg (12-140 pounds). These are considered in the normal range. As weight is related to height, the measurement of the body mass index is a more accurate representation of one’s level of obesity.

Statistics show that approximately 63% of American adults were considered overweight and that 31% are obese. Of severely obese people, 3.8 million Americans weigh over 300 pounds. Of those weighing over 400 pounds, most are men and total over 400,000 Americans.

Body mass index
---------------

The body mass index (BMI) is perhaps the better measurement of an individual’s weight problems than is the actual weight. The body mass index is calculated by dividing the individual’s weight in kilograms by their height in meters2 (squared). This allows for the factoring in of an individuals height. A normal body mass index is less than 25. Above that level, an individual is considered overweight. Above a BMI of 30, an individual is considered obese. Many athletes have body mass indices of less than 20.

Health issues
-------------

A person is overweight usually as a result of carrying around too much fat. This can result in an elevated risk for diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes. A person who is underweight, especially if due to an eating disorder, suffers a number of health risks, including hair loss, gastrointestinal disorders, metabolic disorders and, in some cases, electrolyte imbalances that can lead to heart damage or arrhythmias. The thyroid gland can contribute to an individual’s weight. The thyroid gland controls the rate of metabolism in the body. If it is underactive, the individual can develop obesity or have problems losing weight. If a thyroid gland is overactive, weight loss or an inability to gain weight is likely.
