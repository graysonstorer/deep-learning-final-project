Despite considerable progress in the past decades, societies continue to fail to meet the health care needs of women at key moments of their lives, particularly in their adolescent years and in older age.

It is hoped that you will find the material useful for increasing knowledge about the impact of gender inequality on people's health and about how to develop evidence-based policies, programmes and actions that improve gender equality and health equity.
