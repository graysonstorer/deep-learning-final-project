Developed to meet the demand for a low-cost, high-quality history book, this text is an economically priced version of WESTERN CIVILIZATION: BEYOND BOUNDARIES, 7e. The Advantage Edition offers the high level of scholarship and engaging narrative of the full text, while limiting the number of features, images, and maps. Each volume is packaged in a paperback, two-color format that appeals to those seeking a comprehensive, trade-sized history text. Like its full-length counterpart, the Advantage Edition of WESTERN CIVILIZATION encompasses the full social and political story of Western Civilization within a wider definition of Europe that includes Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, and European frontiers. The text emphasizes Europe's interaction with the world and encourages readers to question why and how history unfolded as it did.
