Treatment of the Obese Patient is a timely and informative text for all health care providers challenged with helping patients manage weight. This volume includes insight into recent scientific advances in obesity research and provides the most up-to-date reviews of current treatment issues and strategies. The volume is divided into two parts. Part 1 covers new discoveries in the physiological control of body weight, as well as the pathophysiology of obesity. Expert authors discuss pathways that control food intake, energy expenditure, and peripheral nutrient metabolism, including a look at the emerging evidence of the role of adipose tissue as an endocrine organ. Part 2 covers issues central to clinical management. Authors in this section discuss polycystic ovarian syndrome, diabetes, energy density, glycemic index, low-carbohydrate diets, the role of physical activity, and novel approaches to pharmacotherapy, surgery, and management of micronutrient deficiencies in the postbariatric patient. An essential, practical text that sorts, synthesizes, and interprets the latest information on obesity-related topics, Treatment of the Obese Patient is an essential volume for clinical endocrinologists and other health care providers.
