Finding _Homo_ nearly 3 million years ago
-----------------------------------------

The fossil record of humans is notoriously patchy and incomplete. Even so, skeletal remains and artifacts unearthed in Africa in recent decades have done much to illuminate human evolution. But what is the origin of the genus _Homo_? Villmoare _et al._ found a fossil mandible and teeth from the Afar region in Ethiopia. The find extends the record of recognizable _Homo_ by at least half a million years, to almost 2.8 million years ago. The morphological traits of the fossil align more closely with _Homo_ than with any other hominid genus. DiMaggio _et al._ confirm the ancient date of the site and suggest that these early humans lived in a setting that was more open and arid than previously thought.

_Science_, this issue p. [1352](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343), p. [1355](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1415)

Abstract
--------

Our understanding of the origin of the genus _Homo_ has been hampered by a limited fossil record in eastern Africa between 2.0 and 3.0 million years ago (Ma). Here we report the discovery of a partial hominin mandible with teeth from the Ledi-Geraru research area, Afar Regional State, Ethiopia, that establishes the presence of _Homo_ at 2.80 to 2.75 Ma. This specimen combines primitive traits seen in early _Australopithecus_ with derived morphology observed in later _Homo_, confirming that dentognathic departures from the australopith pattern occurred early in the _Homo_ lineage. The Ledi-Geraru discovery has implications for hypotheses about the timing and place of origin of the genus _Homo_.

Fifty years after the recognition of the species _Homo habilis_ as the earliest known representative of our genus ([_1_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R1)), the origin of _Homo_ remains clouded. This uncertainty stems in large part from a limited fossil record between 2.0 and 3.0 million years ago (Ma), especially in eastern Africa. Some taxa from this time period, such as _Australopithecus africanus_ (~2.8 to 2.3 Ma) and the less well known _A. garhi_ (~2.5 Ma) and _A. aethiopicus_ (~2.7 to 2.3 Ma), appear too specialized cranially and/or dentally to represent the probable proximate ancestral conditions for _Homo_ species known in Africa by ~2.0 Ma (_H. habilis_ and _H. rudolfensis_). This leaves a thin scatter of isolated, variably informative specimens dated to 2.4 to 2.3 Ma as the only credible fossil evidence bearing on the earliest known populations of the genus _Homo_ ([_2_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R2), [_3_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R3)).

Here we describe a recently recovered partial hominin mandible, LD 350-1, from the Ledi-Geraru research area, Afar Regional State, Ethiopia, that extends the fossil record of _Homo_ back in time a further 0.4 million years. The specimen, securely dated to 2.80 to 2.75 Ma, combines derived morphology observed in later _Homo_ with primitive traits seen in early _Australopithecus_. The discovery has implications for hypotheses concerning the timing and place of _Homo_ origins.

The LD 350 locality resides in the Lee Adoyta region of the Ledi-Geraru research area ([Fig. 1](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#)). Geologic research at Lee Adoyta ([_4_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R4)) identified fault-bounded sedimentary packages dated 2.84 to 2.58 Ma. The LD 350-1 mandible was recovered on the surface of finely bedded fossiliferous silts 10 m conformably above the Gurumaha Tuff ([Fig. 1](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#)). The matrix adherent to the specimen is consistent with it having eroded from these silts [for details on stratigraphy and depositional environment, see ([_4_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R4))]. The Gurumaha Tuff is radiometrically dated to 2.822 ± 0.006 Ma ([_4_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R4)), a date that is consistent with the normal magnetic polarity of the Gurumaha section, presumably the Gauss Chron. An upper bounding age for LD 350-1 is provided by an adjacent downfaulted younger block that contains the 2.669 ± 0.011 Ma Lee Adoyta Tuff. A magnetostratigraphic reversal 12 m conformably above the Lee Adoyta Tuff is inferred to be the Gauss/Matuyama boundary at 2.58 Ma ([_4_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R4)). Because no significant erosional events intervene between the Gurumaha Tuff and the fossiliferous horizon, the age of LD 350-1 can be further constrained by stratigraphic scaling. Applying a sedimentation rate of either 14 cm per thousand years (ky) from the Lee Adoyta fault block or 30 cm/ky from the Hadar Formation ([_5_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R5)) provides age estimates of 2.77 and 2.80 million years (My), respectively, for LD 350-1. Based on the current chronostratigraphic framework for Ledi-Geraru, we consider the age of LD 350-1 to be 2.80 to 2.75 My.

Details in ([_6_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R6)).

The hominin specimen, found by Chalachew Seyoum on 29 January 2013, comprises the left side of an adult mandibular corpus that preserves the partial or complete crowns and roots of the canine, both premolars, and all three molars. The corpus is well preserved from the symphysis to the root of the ascending ramus and retromolar platform. Surface detail is very good to excellent, and there is no evidence of significant transport. The inferior margin of the corpus and the lingual alveolar margin are intact, but the buccal alveolar margin is chipped between P 3 and M 1. The P 4, M 2, and M 3 crowns are complete and well preserved, but the C, P 3, and M 1 crowns are incomplete ([Fig. 2](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#) and text S2). The anterior dentition is represented by the broken root of the lateral incisor and the alveolus of the central incisor.

Given its location and age, it is natural to ask whether the LD 350-1 mandible represents a late-surviving population of _A. afarensis_, whose youngest known samples date to ~3.0 Ma at the neighboring Hadar site ([_6_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R6)). Indeed, in overall dental and mandibular size, LD 350-1 matches smaller specimens of _A. afarensis_ (figs. S1 to S4 and tables S1 to S3). In addition, LD 350-1 shares with _A. afarensis_ a primitive anterior corpus, including an inclined symphyseal cross section, a bulbous anterior symphyseal face, and a projecting inferior transverse torus that is only slightly elevated above the corpus base ([Fig. 2A](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#)). There are, however, substantial differences between LD 350-1 and the mandibles and teeth of _A. afarensis_. LD 350-1 lacks the lateral corpus hollow in which the mental foramen is located, which distinguishes _A. afarensis_ mandibles across their size range. Instead, the LD 350-1 corpus is slightly convex inferosuperiorly, with the mental foramen located lateralmost on this arc (fig. S5). Unlike in _A. afarensis_, the anterior corpus of LD 350-1 bears a distinct symphyseal keel, accentuated by a flattened area between it and a pronounced canine jugum ([Fig. 2](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#)). It lacks both an incisura mandibulae anterior and a mentum osseum, and thus does not have a chin. The P 3 buccal crown profile is symmetrical in occlusal view, lacking the prominent mesiobuccal extension that skews the P 3 crown outline in _A. afarensis_. The P 3 occlusal enamel is worn through to dentine buccally, yet the moderately worn molars retain considerable occlusal relief. In _A. afarensis_, a reversed wear pattern is typical: The canine and mesial moiety of P 3 remain relatively unscathed by wear even when molar occlusal enamel is exhausted ([_6_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R6)). The wear disparity in LD 350-1 may signal modification of the relatively primitive C/P 3 complex of _A. afarensis_, which, while non-honing, retained apelike aspects of crown shape and occlusal wear ([_6_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R6), [_7_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R7)). The basally expanded hypoconid that creates the characteristic “bilobate” buccal crown contour in _A. afarensis_ M 1 s and M 2 s is not evident in LD 350-1 ([_7_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R7)). Finally, there is a distinct C7 cusp on the LD 350-1 M 1 ([Fig. 2](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#)), yet no such cusp has been recorded for an _A. afarensis_ M 1 (_n_ = 18) ([_8_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R8)_,_[_9_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R9)).

Despite a well-developed lateral prominence that swells the corpus anterior to the ascending ramus, LD 350-1 lacks the great corpus thickening, inflated corpus contours beneath P 3-M 1, and anterior dental arch constriction seen in robust australopith mandibles, including Omo 18-1967-18 (holotype of _A. aethiopicus_, ~2.6 Ma). Postcanine dental expansion, including the differential enlargement of lower molar entoconids typical of robust australopiths, is also absent ([_8_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R8)) (figs. S1 to S3 and table S4).

LD 350-1 also differs from _Australopithecus_ in features that align it with early _Homo_. The inferior and alveolar margins of the corpus are subparallel, resulting in similar corpus depths at P3 and M2 ([Fig. 2](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#)), whereas in _A. afarensis, A. africanus_, and _A. sediba_, the corpus is typically deepest under the premolars ([_10_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R10), [_11_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R11)). Some specimens of early _Homo_, such as SK 45 and KNM-ER 60000 ([_10_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R10), [_12_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R12)), have a deeper corpus anteriorly, but LD 350-1 resembles many others that are relatively uniform in depth along the corpus ([_10_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R10), [_13_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R13)–[_16_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R16)) (figs. S5 and S6 and table S5). In LD 350-1, the mental foramen opens directly posteriorly into a short groove on the corpus. A posteriorly opening foramen is the most common condition in early and modern _Homo_ ([_13_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R13), [_17_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R17)). The foramen always opens anteriorly or anterosuperiorly in _A. afarensis_ mandibles, whereas in _A_. _africanus_ its orientation ranges from anteroinferior to directly lateral. The anterior margin of the ascending ramus in LD 350-1 becomes independent from the corpus opposite the middle of the M 3 crown, and in lateral view only the distalmost part of this crown is hidden ([Fig. 2](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#) and fig. S5). In the great majority of _Australopithecus_ mandibles, the anterior margin of the ramus is positioned further anteriorly, between mid- and distal M 2. A posterior origin of the ramus margin is most common in specimens of early _Homo_ (fig. S7 and table S6).

The LD 350-1 molars have simple occlusal surfaces, with salient, marginally positioned cusp apices and broad occlusal basins. With the exception of a tiny protostylid on M 3, the crowns are devoid of cingular remnants. Estimated M 1 length is small (fig. S4). The breadth across the mesial aspect of M 2 and M 3 measures less than the distal breadth, giving these crowns a mesially tapered occlusal outline. This distinctive outline is due in part to a relatively confined mesiolingual cusp (metaconid) on these teeth ([Fig. 2](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#) and table S4). In _A. afarensis_ and _A. africanus_, and also in _A. sediba_ specimen MH1, M 2 and M 3 crown outlines are square or distally tapered (especially M 3) (fig. S8). Although some early _Homo_ distal molars show reduced mesial breadths, there is significant overlap with _Australopithecus_ in mesial:distal breadth ratio, and none approaches the uniquely tapered outline of LD 350-1 (table S7). Whereas _Australopithecus_ M 2 and M 3 crowns usually have a sloping buccal face up to the point of advanced occlusal wear, the buccal walls of these teeth in LD 350-1 descend almost vertically from the occlusal rim, as frequently observed in early and later _Homo_ (fig. S8). LD 350-1 departs from the _A. africanus_ dental pattern, which includes buccolingually expanded postcanine teeth (especially M 2-3) and flattened molar occlusal surfaces in specimens with similar degrees of premolar wear ([_6_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R6), [_7_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R7)). LD 350-1 possesses a mesiodistally shorter M 3 than M 2, which is common in _Homo_ but occurs only in 1 out of 16 _A. afarensis_ and 3 out of 14 _A. africanus_ specimens in our sample. In crown length, the LD 350-1 M 3 falls outside the distribution of 20 _A. africanus_ and 19 _A. afarensis_ M 3 s (fig. S3).

With an age of 2.80 to 2.75 My, the Ledi-Geraru mandible is younger than the youngest known _A. afarensis_ fossils from Hadar, ~3.0 Ma. Although it shares with _A. afarensis_ primitive anterior corpus morphology, the specimen falls outside the range of variation for most other diagnostic mandibular and dental traits of this species. In the majority of traits that distinguish it from this species, LD 350-1 presents morphology that we interpret as transitional between _Australopithecus_ and _Homo_.

The _Homo_ postcanine dental pattern ([_18_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R18)) is present in members E through G of the Shungura Formation of Ethiopia (~2.4 to 2.0 Ma) and is best represented by mandible Omo 75-14, which has a reduced M 3 crown and a C7 cusp on M 1 ([_18_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R18)), features shared with LD 350-1. The A.L. 666-1 maxilla from the Busidima Formation at Hadar also establishes the _Homo_ dentognathic pattern by ~2.3 Ma ([_19_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R19)). A small collection of postcanine teeth from members B and C (~2.9 to 2.6 Ma) of the Shungura Formation evinces more derived morphology than _A. afarensis_ and has been affiliated with _A. africanus/Homo_ ([_18_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R18), [_20_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R20)). Although _A. africanus_ is usually thought to have been endemic to southern Africa, the corresponding time period in the East African record is notoriously poor in hominin fossils. At ~2.80 to 2.75 Ma, LD 350-1 falls within the member B-C temporal interval and is broadly contemporaneous with _A. africanus_ samples from Makapansgat and Sterkfontein ([_21_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R21)). Morphologically, however, it is distinguished from _A. africanus_ by its subequal anterior and posterior corpus heights, posterior position of the anterior ramus margin, posteriorly oriented mental foramen, steeper premolar-molar wear gradient, vertical buccal walls of M 2-3, and reduced M 3. In the combination of these features, LD 350-1 resembles younger East African _Homo_ specimens more than it does geologically contemporaneous or older _Australopithecus._ Summarizing the Shungura Formation dental evidence, Suwa _et al_. [([_18_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R18)) pp. 270–271] identified the 2.9- to 2.7-Ma interval as “the transitional period when evolution occurred from an _A. afarensis_-like to a more advanced species…close in overall dental morphology to the _A. africanus_ condition but also mostly within the _A. afarensis_ and/or early _Homo_ ranges of variation.” We consider the Ledi-Geraru mandible to sample a population from this transition and to point to a close phyletic relationship with _Homo_ at 2.4 to 2.3 Ma.

A set of teeth comprising the isolated left and right P 3-M 2 crowns of a single individual (KNM-ER 5431) from the upper Tulu Bor Member at Koobi Fora, Kenya ([_22_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R22)), is germane to the status of LD 350-1. Constrained in age between ~2.7 and ~3.0 Ma ([_23_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R23)), these teeth show a mix of australopith (premolar cusp morphology) and early _Homo_-like (C7 cusp on M 1 and M 2) characters ([_15_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R15)), whereas its P 3 form has been characterized as “intermediate between _A. afarensis_…and _A. africanus_ or early _Homo_” [([_24_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R24)), p. 199]. The KNM-ER 5431 teeth could represent the same East African transitional form as the LD 350-1 mandible.

Arguments for the role of 2.5-Ma _A. garhi_ as the direct ancestor of _Homo_ are relevant to interpretations of LD 350-1 ([_25_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R25)). The tremendous postcanine dental size and differentially enlarged P 3 of _A. garhi_ holotype cranium BOU-VP 12/130 are a poor match for the modest-size teeth of the Ledi jaw (in resampling analyses, the LD 350-1 lower second molar and the BOU-VP 12/130 upper second molar were found to be diminishingly unlikely to sample the same species; see text S3). To include LD 350-1 and BOU-VP 12/130 in the same species lineage and simultaneously postulate an ancestor-descendant relationship between _A. garhi_ and _Homo_ would require a dramatic increase in tooth size between ~2.8 and ~2.5 Ma, and then an equally dramatic decrease in tooth size in a ~2.5- to 2.3-Ma transition to _Homo_. Although nonrobust mandibles with derived corpus morphology and smaller teeth are approximately contemporaneous with _A. garhi_ in the Middle Awash of Ethiopia ([_25_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R25), [_26_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R26)), it is unclear whether these represent _A. garhi_ or a second lineage, potentially of _Homo_. For all of these reasons, we consider the hypothesis that posits LD 350-1 as representing a population ancestral to ~2.4- to 2.3-Ma _Homo_, to the exclusion of _A. garhi_, to be more parsimonious than ones that include this taxon in the _Homo_ lineage [consistent with the phylogenetic analysis in ([_27_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R27)); see text S3].

By ~2.0 Ma, at least two species of the genus _Homo_ were present in Africa, _H. habilis_ and _H. rudolfensis_ ([_3_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R3), [_28_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R28)), but primitive anterior corpus morphology distinguishes LD 350-1 from both of them. These species are distinct from one another in dental arcade shape ([_12_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R12), [_29_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R29)), and LD 350-1 suggests the primitively arched canine/incisor row seen in _H. habilis_ sensu stricto (fig. S9). For the present, pending further discoveries, we assign LD 350-1 to _Homo_, species indeterminate. The identification of the 2.80- to 2.75-Ma Ledi-Geraru mandible as representing a likely phyletic predecessor to early Pleistocene _Homo_ implies that phylogenetic schemes positing the origin of the _Homo_ lineage from _A. sediba_ as late as 1.98 Ma are likely to be incorrect [contra([_30_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R30)); see text S3].

The time period 2.8 to 2.5 Ma witnessed climatic shifts that are frequently hypothesized to have led to the origin of the _Homo_ lineage ([_3_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R3), [_31_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R31)–[_33_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R33)). Although the open habitats reconstructed for the Lee Adoyta faunal assemblages provide a new window on these changes ([_4_](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aaa1343#core-collateral-R4)), too little is known of the pattern of hominin evolution during this period to forge causal links to specific evolutionary events. The Ledi-Geraru specimen confirms that divergence from australopith dental and mandibular anatomy was an early hallmark of the _Homo_ lineage. Additional discoveries are needed to determine whether or not these dentognathic changes were accompanied by neurocranial expansion, technological innovation, or shifts in other anatomical/behavioral systems that are familiar components of the _Homo_ adaptive pattern.
