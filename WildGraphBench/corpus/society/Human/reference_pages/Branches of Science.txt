# Branches of Science 

• Fundamental Sciences 

-Empirical Sciences 

Includes both Social and Natural sciences 

Knowledge based on observable phenomena 

Capable of being tested for validity , reproducibility 

-Formal Sciences 

Mathematics, logic 

Use a priori methodology 

• Interdisciplinary and Applied Sciences 

-Medicine 

-Engineering 3

# Empirical Sciences 

• Natural Science 

-Branch of science that seeks to elucidate the rules that govern the 

natural world by applying an empirical and scientific method to the study 

of the universe. 

-Physical science – Physics, Chemistry 

-Earth science – Ecology, Oceanography, Geology, Meteorology 

-Life science – Biology, Zoology, Human Biology, Botany 

• Social Sciences 

-Apply the scientific method to study human behavior, society, and social 

patterns 

-Contrast to Humanities that use a critical or analytical approach to the 

study of the human condition 

-"Social science" is commonly used as an umbrella term to refer to a 

plurality of fields outside of the natural sciences. 

-Anthropology, archaeology, business administration, communication, 

criminology, economics, education, government, linguistics, international 

relations, political science, psychology (especially social psychology), 

sociology and, in some contexts, geography, history and law 4

# Formal Sciences 

• Branches of knowledge that are concerned with formal systems 

-Logic 

-Mathematics 

-Decision theory concerned with identifying the values, uncertainties and other issues 

relevant in a given decision, its rationality, and the resulting optimal decision .

-Theoretical computer science 

-Information and systems theory 

-Statistics is the study of the collection, organization, and interpretation of data including 

planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. 

-Some aspects of linguistics 

• Not concerned with the validity of theories based on empirical knowledge, 

but the properties of formal systems based on definitions and rules 

• Methods of the formal sciences essential to the construction and testing of 

scientific models dealing with observable reality 

• Major advances in formal sciences have often enabled major advances in 

the empirical sciences (e.g. validity of observations from a case series) 5

# Applied Sciences 

• Application of scientific knowledge transferred into a physical environment. 

Examples include testing a theoretical model through the use of formal 

science or solving a practical problem through the use of natural science .

• Applied science differs from fundamental science, which seeks to describe 

the most basic objects and forces, having less emphasis on practical 

applications. 

• Medicine is derived from the Latin ars medicina , meaning the art of healing 

-Applied science related to the art of healing by diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of 

disease. 

-Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences , biomedical research, genetics and 

medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through 

medication or surgery 

-Therapies include medications, surgery, psychotherapy, external splints & traction, 

prostheses, biologics, pharmaceuticals, ionizing radiation.
