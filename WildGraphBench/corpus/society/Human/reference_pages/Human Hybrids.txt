By Michael F. Hammer 

It is hard to imagine today,  but for most of  hu mankind’s evolutionary history, 

multiple hu man like species shared the earth. As recently as 40,000 years ago, 

Homo sapiens  lived alongside several kindred forms, including the Neander -

tals  and tiny  Homo floresiensis.  For decades scientists have debated exactly 

how  H. sapiens  originated and came to be the last human species standing. 

Thanks in large part to genetic studies in the 1980s, one theory emerged as the 

clear front-runner. In this view, anatomically modern humans arose in Africa 

and spread out across the rest of the Old World, completely replacing the exist -

ing archaic groups. Exactly how this novel form became the last human spe -

cies on the earth is mysterious. Perhaps the invaders killed off the natives they 

encountered, or outcompeted the strangers on their own turf, or simply repro -

duced at a higher rate. However it happened, the newcomers seemed to have 

eliminated their competitors without interbreeding with them. 

This recent African Replacement model, as it is known, has essentially served as the modern human ori -

gins paradigm for the past 25 years. Yet mounting evidence indicates that it is wrong. Recent advances in

A long-reigning  theory of the origin of  Homo sapiens  holds 

that our species arose in a single locale—sub-Saharan Africa— 

and replaced archaic human species, such as the Neandertals, 

without interbreeding with them. 

But recent studies  of modern and ancient DNA indicate that 

these modern humans from Africa did mate with archaic hu -

mans and hint that this interbreeding helped  H. sapiens  thrive 

as it colonized new lands.

DNA-sequencing technology have enabled researchers to dramati -

cally scale up data collection from living people as well as from 

extinct species. Analyses of these data with increasingly sophisti -

cated computational tools indicate that the story of our family his -

tory is not as simple as most experts thought. It turns out that peo -

ple today carry DNA inherited from Neandertals and other archaic 

humans, revealing that early  H. sapiens  mated with these other 

species and produced fertile offspring who were able to hand this 

genetic legacy down through thousands of generations. In addi -

tion to upsetting the conventional wisdom about our origins, the 

discoveries are driving new inquiries into how extensive the inter -

breeding was, which geographical areas it occurred in and wheth -

er modern humans show signs of benefiting from any of the genet -

ic contributions from our prehistoric cousins. 

> MYSTERIOUS ORIGINS

To fully apprecia Te the effect of these recent genetic findings on 

scientists’ understanding of human evolution, we must look back 

to the 1980s, when the debate over the rise of  H. sapiens  was heat -

ing up. Examining the fossil data, paleoanthropologists agreed 

that an earlier member of our genus,  Homo erectus,  arose in Afri -

ca some two million years ago and began spreading out of that 

continent and into other regions of the Old World shortly thereaf -

ter. Yet they disagreed over how the ancestors of  H. sapiens  transi -

tioned from that archaic form to our modern one, with its round -

ed braincase and delicately built skeleton—features that appear 

in the fossil record at around 195,000 years ago. 

Proponents of the so-called Multiregional Evolution model, 

developed by Milford H. Wolpoff of the University of Michigan 

and his colleagues, argued that the transformation occurred grad -

ually among archaic populations wherever they lived throughout 

Africa, Eurasia and Oceania because of a combination of migra -

tion and mating that allowed beneficial modern traits to spread 

among all these populations. In this scenario, although all modern 

humans shared particular physical features by the end of this 

transition, some regionally distinctive features inherited from 

archaic ancestors per sisted, perhaps because these traits helped 

populations to adapt to their local environments. A variant of Mul -

tiregional Evolution put forward by Fred Smith, now at Illinois 

State University, called the Assimilation model, acknowledges a 

greater contribution of modern traits by populations from Africa. 

In contrast, champions of the Replacement model (also 

known as the Out of Africa model, among other names), includ -

ing Christopher Stringer of the Natural History Museum in Lon -

don, contended that anatomically modern humans arose as a 

distinct species in a single place—sub-Saharan Africa—and went 

on to completely replace all archaic humans everywhere without 

interbreeding with them. A looser version of this theory—the 

Hybridization model proposed by Günter Bräuer of the Universi -

ty of Hamburg in Germany—allows for the occasional produc -

tion of hybrids between these modern humans and the archaic 

groups they met up with as they pushed into new lands. 

With only the fossil evidence to go on, the debate seemed 

locked in a stalemate. Genetics changed that situation. With the 

advent of DNA technology, scientists developed methods for piec -

ing together the past by analyzing genetic variation in contempo -

rary human populations and using it to reconstruct evolutionary 

trees for individual genes. By studying a gene tree, researchers 

could infer when and where the last common ancestor of all the 

variants of a given gene existed, thus yielding insights into the 

population of origin for the ancestral sequence. 

In a landmark study published in 1987, Allan C. Wilson of the 

University of California, Berkeley, and his colleagues reported 

that the evolutionary tree for the DNA found in mitochondria— 

the energy-producing components of cells—traced back to a 

female ancestor who lived in an African population around 

200,000 years ago. (Mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA, is passed 

down from mother to child and treated as a single gene in ances -

try studies.) These findings fit the expectations of the Replace -

ment model, as did subsequent studies of small sections of nucle -

ar DNA, including the paternally inherited Y chromosome. 

Further genetic support for the Replacement model came a 

decade later, when Svante Pääbo, now at the Max Planck Insti -

tute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and his 

colleagues succeeded in extracting and analyzing a fragment of 

mtDNA from Neandertal bones. The study found that the Nean -

dertal mtDNA sequences were distinct from those of contempo -

rary humans and that there was no sign of interbreeding be -

tween them—a result that subsequent studies of mtDNA from 

additional Neandertal specimens confirmed. 

To many researchers, these ancient mtDNA findings put the 

nail in the coffin of the Multiregional Evolution and Assimilation 

models. Others, however, maintained that their reasoning suf -

fered from a fundamental problem. The absence of a signal for 

interbreeding in any single independent region of the genome, 

such as in mtDNA, does not necessarily mean that other regions 

of the genome also lack signs of interbreeding. Further, any par -

ticular region of the genome that is tested could lack signs of 

interbreeding even if interbreeding did occur because DNA from 

other species (introgressed DNA) that provided no survival ad -

vantage to  H. sapiens  would tend to disappear from the gene 

pool over time by chance. 

The best way to approach the question of whether  H. sapiens 

interbred with archaic species, such as the Neandertals, is thus to 

compare many regions of their genomes or, ideally, their entire 

genomes. Yet even before such data became available for archaic 

humans, some early genetic studies of modern human DNA 

bucked the majority trend and found data contrary to the 

Replacement model. One clear example came from a 2005 study 

led by Daniel Garrigan, then a postdoctoral researcher in my lab -

oratory. Garrigan looked at DNA sequences from a nonfunctional 

region of the X chromosome known as RRM2P4. Analyses of its 

reconstructed tree pointed to an origin for the sequence, not in 

Africa but in East Asia around 1.5 million years ago, implying that 

the DNA came from an archaic Asian species that intermixed 

with the  H. sapiens  originally from Africa. Similarly, that same 

year our lab discovered variation in another nonfunctional region 

of the X chromosome, Xp21.1, with a gene tree showing two diver -

gent branches that had probably been evolving in complete isola -

tion from one another for around a million years. One of these 

branches was presumably introduced into anatomically modern 

populations by an archaic African species. The RRM2P4 and 

Xp21.1 evidence thus hinted that anatomically modern humans 

mated with archaic humans from Asia and Africa, respectively, 

rather than simply replacing them without interbreeding. 

OUR ARCHAIC DNA 

More recen Tly,  advances in sequencing technology have enabled 

scientists to quickly sequence entire nuclear genomes—includ -

ing those of extinct humans, such as Neandertals. In 2010 Pää -

bo’s group reported that it had reconstructed the better part of a 

Neandertal genome, based on DNA from several Neandertal fos -

sils from Croatia. Contrary to the team’s expectations, the work 

revealed that Neandertals made a small but significant contribu -

tion to the modern human gene pool: non-Africans today exhibit 

a 1 to 4 percent Neandertal contribution to their genomes on av -

erage. To explain this result, the researchers proposed that inter -

breeding between Neandertals and the ancestors of all non-Afri -

cans probably occurred during the limited period when these 

two groups overlapped in the Middle East, perhaps 80,000 to 

50,000 years ago. 

Hot on the heels of the Neandertal genome announcement, 

Pääbo’s team revealed an even more startling discovery. The 

researchers had obtained an mtDNA sequence from a piece of an 

approximately 40,000-year-old finger bone found in Denisova 

Cave in the Altai Mountains in Siberia. Although researchers 

could not determine from the anatomy of the bone what species 

it represented, the genome sequence showed that this individual 

belonged to a population that was slightly more closely related to 

Neandertals than it or Neandertals were to our species. Further, 

after comparing the Denisovan sequence with its counterpart in 

modern populations, the team found a significant amount of 

DNA from a Denisovan-like population—a contribution of 1 to 6 

percent—in Melanesians, Aboriginal Australians, Polynesians, 

and some related groups in the western Pacific but not in Afri -

cans or Eurasians. 

To explain this increasingly complex pattern of DNA sharing, 

the researchers proposed that interbreeding with various archa -

ic forms had occurred at two different times: first, when anatom -

ically modern humans initially migrated out of Africa and mated 

with Neandertals and, later, when the descendants of these ini -

tial migrants made their way to Southeast Asia and encountered 

Denisovan-like humans. The doubly mixed ancestors of present-

day groups such as Melanesians then reached Oceania around 

45,000 years ago, and a second wave of anatomically modern 

humans migrated to East Asia without interbreeding with Den -

isovan-like ancestors.

# Sourcing  Homo sapiens 

Scientists have long debated  how anatomically modern humans 

( dark brown lines ) evolved from their archaic predecessors ( light 

brown lines ). In the theories depicted here, modern humans origi -

nated in Africa. According to the Replacement model, they then 

replaced archaic human species throughout the Old World with -

out interbreeding with them. The Assimilation model, in contrast, 

holds that beneficial modern features from Africa spread among 

these archaic groups by means of a combination of steady migra -

tion and mating known as gene flow ( green arrows ). The Hybrid -

ization model, for its part, posits that modern humans mated 

only rarely, or hybridized ( red arrows ), with archaic species as they 

replaced them. The African Multiregional Evolution model focus -

es exclusively on the archaic-to-modern transition period in Afri -

ca and argues for gene flow and hybridization between distinc -

tive archaic groups there. Such a scenario could theoretically 

have preceded Replacement, Assimilation or Hybridization.

Although discussion of interbreeding in human evolution 

typically focuses on mating between anatomically modern 

humans and Neandertals in Europe or other archaic forms in 

Asia, the greatest opportunity for interspecies coupling would 

have been in Africa, where anatomically modern humans and 

various archaic forms coexisted for much longer than they did 

anywhere else. Unfortunately, the tropical environments of the 

African rain forest do not favor the preservation of DNA in 

ancient remains. Without an African ancient DNA sequence to 

reference, geneticists are currently limited to scouring the 

genomes of modern-day Africans for signs of archaic admixture. 

To that end, my team at the University of Arizona, in collabo -

ration with Jeffrey D. Wall of the University of California, San 

Francisco, gathered sequence data from 61 regions of the genome 

in a sample of three sub-Saharan African populations. Using com -

puter-based simulations to test various evolutionary scenarios, 

we concluded in a 2011 report that these populations received a 2 

percent contribution of genetic material from an extinct human 

population. This group would have split off from the ancestors of 

anatomically modern humans some 700,000 years ago and inter -

bred with moderns around 35,000 years ago in Central Africa. 

Another genetic hint of archaic admixture in Africa has come 

from a study of an unusual Y chromosome sequence obtained 

from an African-American man living in South Carolina whose 

DNA was submitted to a direct-to-consumer genetic testing com -

pany for analysis. His particular variant had never been seen 

before. Comparing his Y sequence against those of other humans, 

as well as chimpanzees, my team determined that his sequence 

represents a previously unknown Y chromosome lineage that 

branched off the Y chromosome tree more than 300,000 years 

ago. We then searched a database of nearly 6,000 African Y chro -

mosomes and identified 11 matches—all of which came from 

men who lived in a very small area of western Cameroon. The 

finding, published in March in the  American Journal of Human 

Genetics,  indicates that the last common ancestor of all modern 

Y chromosome variants is 70 percent older than previously 

thought. The presence of this very ancient lineage in contempo -

rary people is a possible sign of interbreeding between  H. sapi -

ens  and an unknown archaic species in western Central Africa. 

Recently the fossil record, too, has yielded support for the 

possibility of interbreeding within Africa. Just after the publica -

tion of our results in 2011, a group of paleontologists working at 

the Iwo Eleru site in Nigeria reanalyzed remains that exhibit cra -

nial features intermediate between those of archaic and modern No Denisovan interbreeding Neandertal interbreeding Denisovan interbreeding Archaic African hominin interbreeding

# Evidence for Interbreeding 

The fossil record  indicates that  Homo  s apien s  originated in Afri -

ca by around 200,000 years ago. Recent DNA studies suggest 

that these anatomically modern humans mated with the archa -

ic humans they happened on as they migrated within Africa and 

out into the rest of the Old World ( gray arrows ). The map below 

shows ranges of archaic species—including a species recently 

identified on the basis of DNA from a fossilized finger bone 

from Denisova Cave in Siberia—and regions where interbreed -

ing with moderns may have occurred  ( ellip s es ), based on the 

available DNA evidence.

humans and determined that they date to just 13,000 years ago— 

long after anatomically modern  H. sapiens  had debuted. These 

results, along with similar findings from the Ishango site in the 

Democratic Re public of the Congo, suggest that the evolution of 

anatomical modernity in Africa may have been more complicat -

ed than any of the leading models for modern human origins 

have envisioned. Either archaic humans lived alongside modern 

ones in the recent past, or populations with both modern and ar -

chaic features interbred over millennia. 

BENEFICIAL CONTRIBUTIONS? 

alThough  The analyses  of Neandertal and Denisovan DNA provide 

increasing evidence that archaic humans contributed to our 

genetic heritage, many aspects of this interbreeding remain unre -

solved. Current estimates of the percentage of our genome that 

was contributed by Neandertals and Denisovan-like humans are 

based on a method that does not provide much information about 

how and when mixing occurred. To learn more, researchers need 

to improve their understanding of exactly 

which stretches of the genome came from 

archaic humans and which archaic spe -

cies contributed what. During his disser -

tation work in my lab, Fernando L. Men -

dez took steps toward doing exactly that. 

He found strong evidence that some con -

temporary non-Africans carry a stretch 

of chromosome 12 containing the gene 

STAT2  (which is involved in the body’s 

first line of defense against viral patho -

gens) that came from Neandertals. 

Detailed studies of DNA regions 

inherited from archaic ancestors will 

also help tackle the question of whether 

acquiring these genetic variants con -

ferred an adaptive advantage to early  H. 

sapiens.  Indeed,  STAT2  provides a fascinating example of an 

apparently advantageous archaic variant entering the modern 

human gene pool. Approximately 10 percent of people from Eur -

asia and Oceania carry the Neandertal-like variant of  STAT2. 

Interestingly, it occurs at a roughly 10-fold higher frequency in 

Melanesia than in East Asia. Analysis suggests that this DNA seg -

ment rose to high frequency through positive natural selection 

(that is, because it aided reproductive success or survival) rather 

than merely by chance, implying that it benefited the anatomi -

cally modern populations of Melanesia. 

Similarly, a Neandertal-like section of the so-called human leu -

kocyte antigen (HLA) region of the genome appears to have risen 

to relatively high frequency in Eurasian populations as a result of 

positive natural selection related to its role in fighting pathogens. 

Perhaps we should not be surprised to find archaic contributions 

containing genes that function to increase immunity. It is easy to 

imagine that the acquisition of a gene variant that is adapted to 

fending off pathogens in non-African environments would imme -

diately benefit human ancestors as they expanded from Africa 

into new habitats. 

In light of the accumulating evidence for interbreeding be -

tween anatomically modern  H. sapiens  and archaic humans both 

inside Africa and beyond its confines, the Replacement model is 

no longer tenable. Modern and archaic species of  Homo  were 

able to produce viable hybrid offspring. Thus, archaic forms 

could go extinct while still leaving behind their genetic footprints 

in the modern human genome. That said, the genomes of people 

today seem to derive mostly from African ancestors—contribu -

tions from archaic Eurasians are smaller than either the Multire -

gional Evolution or Assimilation models predict. 

A number of researchers now favor Bräuer’s Hybridization 

model, which holds that mating between  H. sapiens  and archaic 

species was limited to a few isolated instances. I agree that such 

interbreeding appears to have been rare after modern humans 

began spreading out of Africa, but I think there is more to the 

story than that. Given the complexity of the African fossil record, 

which indicates that a variety of transitional human groups, with 

a mosaic of archaic and modern features, lived over an extensive 

geographic area from Morocco to South Africa between roughly 

200,000 and 35,000 years ago, I favor a model that involves inter -

species mating during the archaic-to-modern transition. Some -

times called African Multiregional Evolution, this scenario allows 

for the possibility that some of the traits 

that make us anatomically modern were 

inherited from transitional forms before 

they went extinct. To my mind, African 

Multiregional Evolution, in combination 

with Bräuer’s Hybridization model, best 

explains genetic and fossil data to date. 

Before scientists can assess this mod -

el for modern human origins fully, we 

will need to better understand which 

genes code for anatomically modern 

traits and decipher their evolutionary 

history. Further analysis of both archaic 

and modern genomes should aid re -

searchers in pinpointing when and 

where mixing occurred—and whether 

the archaic genes that entered the mod -

ern human gene pool benefited the populations that acquired 

them. This information will help us evaluate the hypothesis that 

interbreeding with archaic populations that were well adapted 

to their local environments lent traits to  H. sapiens  that spurred 

its rise to global preeminence. The sharing of genes through 

occasional interspecies mating is one way that evolutionary nov -

elties arise in many species of animals and plants, so it should 

not be surprising if the same process occurred in our own past. 

Many loose ends remain. Yet one thing is clear: the roots of 

modern humans trace back to not just a single ancestral popula -

tion in Africa but to populations throughout the Old World. 

Although archaic humans have often been seen as rivals of mod -

ern humans, scientists now must seriously consider the possi -

bility that they were the secret of  H. sapien s’ success.
