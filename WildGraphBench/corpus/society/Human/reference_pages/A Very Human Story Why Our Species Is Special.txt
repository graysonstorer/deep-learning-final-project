# A Very Human Story: Why Our Species Is Special

Join Our Community of Science Lovers!

“What a piece of work is a man,” proclaimed Hamlet in the play of the same name, partly in admiration over our nobility and intelligence, partly in despair over our flaws. We _Scientific American_ editors have to agree with Shakespeare's sentiments, and in this special single-topic issue, we join him in his apparent obsession to try to understand our species anyway.

We do have the benefit of perspective gained from the process of science instead of relying on storytelling alone. For instance, there's the matter of how _Homo sapiens_ came to be the only human species on the earth when we were once just one of a diverse array of bipedal species. In her article, “Last Hominin Standing,” senior editor Kate Wong paints the picture of our rise.

Although we do seem to share many cognitive traits with animals, our intellectual capabilities have no equal on this planet (“Inside Our Heads”). Humans are apparent standouts because of the richness of our subjective experience (“The Hardest Problem”) and an ability to communicate thoughts to others (“Talking through Time”). A defining characteristic of our species is that we can transmit knowledge from one generation to the next and then build and innovate on these cultural bequests from our ancestors. All of this, in turn, selects for better cognitive skills and bigger brains (“An Evolved Uniqueness”). We demonstrate our communal cleverness by devising machines that combine numerous past innovations. The internal-combustion engine is just such a stellar example (“Techno _Sapiens_”). As a species whose members number in the billions and are extensively settled across nearly all the continents, we have an inclination to establish norms and conventions that regulate our behavior when living in large groups (“The Origins of Morality”).

Looking ahead, we may even, through AI, or artificial intelligence, design a master algorithm that could enable models of ourselves to act as the ultimate personal assistant that performs many of our everyday tasks (“Our Digital Doubles”). As we continue an influx into cities, animals around us are necessarily adapting rapidly to a more urban world (“Darwin in the City”). Seeds are reshaping on dandelions. Instead of being distributed on the winds, they drop straight down onto precious, limited soil. Peregrine falcons are settling in, snapping up plentiful pigeons. What is to come? Perhaps only we can imagine where the complex changes we've set in motion may lead. And if we don't like what we envision, only we have the knowledge and the power to refashion the world for a more hopeful future. That's an awful lot of responsibility for a physically weak, though cognitively powerful, biped, but we'll have to shoulder it.

It’s Time to Stand Up for Science

If you enjoyed this article, I’d like to ask for your support.Scientific American has served as an advocate for science and industry for 180 years, and right now may be the most critical moment in that two-century history.

I’ve been a Scientific American subscriber since I was 12 years old, and it helped shape the way I look at the world.SciAm always educates and delights me, and inspires a sense of awe for our vast, beautiful universe. I hope it does that for you, too.

If you[subscribe to Scientific American](https://www.scientificamerican.com/getsciam/), you help ensure that our coverage is centered on meaningful research and discovery; that we have the resources to report on the decisions that threaten labs across the U.S.; and that we support both budding and working scientists at a time when the value of science itself too often goes unrecognized.

In return, you get essential news,[captivating podcasts](https://www.scientificamerican.com/podcasts/), brilliant infographics,[can't-miss newsletters](https://www.scientificamerican.com/newsletters/), must-watch videos,[challenging games](https://www.scientificamerican.com/games/), and the science world's best writing and reporting. You can even[gift someone a subscription](https://www.scientificamerican.com/getsciam/gift/).

There has never been a more important time for us to stand up and show why science matters. I hope you’ll support us in that mission.
