# Origin of the Genus Homo

Introduction
------------

For the first, four million years or so of hominin evolution, the hominin fossil record is characterized by, among other trends, canine reduction and postcranial metamorphosis in the following genera: _Sahelanthropus_, _Orrorin_, _Ardipithecus_, _Australopithecus_, and _Paranthropus_. As the Pliocene epoch came to a close and global climate was shifting at about 2.5 million years ago (deMenocal [2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR32 "deMenocal PB. African climate change and faunal evolution during the Pliocene–Pleistocene. Earth Planet Sci Lett. 2004;220(1–2):3–24.")), there is a concomitant change in the hominin fossil record. In this increasingly cooler world, something new, both anatomically and behaviorally, emerged. This is the origin of the genus _Homo_.

Of the earliest members of the genus _Homo_, the best-known species are _Homo habilis_, _Homo rudolfensis_, and _Homo erectus_ (Table[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#Tab1)). Listed roughly in order of their earliest appearance from oldest to youngest, these three species are the focus of this review. The first two species are the most primitive. Compared to what is known about _H. erectus_, little is known about how they differ in anatomy and behavior from one another and from preceding australopiths. Although it was anatomically and behaviorally primitive compared to modern humans, _H. erectus_ signifies a major shift in hominin evolution, most notably through increased brain and body size and increasingly complex tools and behaviors.

It is generally agreed upon that _H. habilis_, spanning from 2.3 to 1.4 million years ago, is descended from a species of _Australopithecus_. If _H. habilis_ evolved in East Africa, then _Australopithecus afarensis_ and _Australopithecus garhi_ are its possible ancestors, but if _H. habilis_ evolved in South Africa, then _Australopithecus africanus_ and _Australopithecus sediba_ are candidates. Future fossil discoveries will probably answer this question. However, based on what is already known about _H. habilis_, it widely accepted that it is the common ancestor of all later species in the genus _Homo_ including our own, _Homo sapiens_.

_H. habilis_ and _H. rudolfensis—_ the poorly understood, but slightly larger species dated to about 1.9 million years ago (Fig.[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#Fig1))—are restricted to East and South Africa. However, _H. erectus_, which diverged from _H. habilis_ around 1.8 million years ago, marks the first hominin to disperse outside of Africa. Between about 1.9 and 1.8 million years ago, there is evidence for geographic and temporal overlap of all three early _Homo_ species in East Africa.

The exceptionally large-toothed and strong-jawed robust australopiths (_Paranthropus_, which also descended from an earlier _Australopithecus_ species), with their distinct dietary niche, one of tough nuts, seeds and fruits and fibrous vegetation, continued to thrive in some of the same localities as these species of early _Homo_, but they remained evolutionarily separate. Early _Homo_ is distinguishable from contemporaneous robust australopiths by their smaller teeth and jaws and by larger cranial capacity.

Because it is more derived, _H. erectus_ is more easily distinguished from earlier hominins and _Paranthropus—_ not just in craniodental anatomy but in body proportions and postcranial morphology as well. _H. erectus_ is nearly modern in its postcranial anatomy, with few exceptions. Within Africa, early _H. erectus_ overlapped with the two other species of early _Homo_ but eventually far outlasted them. Outside of Africa, _H. erectus_ fossils are the most primitive hominins yet discovered, and remains have been recovered from sites across Eurasia and Indonesia, beginning as early as about 1.8 million years ago and spanning over one million years, disappearing in Asia by about 400 thousand years ago (Shen et al. [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR102 "Shen G, Gao X, Gao B, Granger DE. Age of Zhoukoudian Homo erectus determined with 26Al/10Be burial dating. Nature. 2009;458:198–200.")). It is possible that the last _H. erectus_ may have survived in Indonesia as recently as 30,000 years ago (Swisher et al. [1996](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR110 "Swisher CC, Rink WJ, Antón SC, Schwarcz HP, Curtis GH, Suprijo A, et al. Latest Homo erectus of Java: potential contemporaneity with Homo sapiens in Southeast Asia. Science. 1996;274(5294):1870–4.")), after _H. sapiens_ had already reached the region, but this date is controversial and may be soon replaced by a much older estimate of about 550,000 years ago (Indriati et al. [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR56 "Indriati E, Swisher CC III, Lepre C, Quinn RL, Suriyanto RA, Hascaryo AT, et al. The age of the 20 meter Solo River Terrace, Ngandong (Java, Indonesia) reconsidered. Am J Phys Anthropol. 2010;Suppl 50:135.")). Regardless of its extinction date, _H. erectus_ thrived and evolved across the tropical and temperate regions of the Old World with a much wider geographic distribution than any preceding hominins.

As with so many mammalian extinctions in the Pleistocene fossil record, it is unclear why _H. erectus_ did not survive to the present day, except that later species of _Homo_ had much bigger brains, much more sophisticated technology, and either indirectly or directly out-competed _H. erectus_ at being big-brained, bipedal, stone tool-making hominins.

Because the fossil record is denser for this species, the variation in _H. erectus_ is better understood than in any of the earlier hominins. A growing proportion of researchers employ a separate species name for the earliest members of _H. erectus_ that tend to be smaller and are found mostly in Africa; they call these _Homo ergaster_ (Tattersall [2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR111 "Tattersall I. Homo ergaster and its contemporaries. In: Henke W, Tattersall I, editors. Handbook of paleoanthropology, 3 Vols. Berlin: Springer; 2007. p. 1633–53."); for discussion see Dunsworth and Walker [2002](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR36 "Dunsworth HM, Walker A. Early genus Homo. In: Hartwig W, editor. The primate fossil record. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 2002. p. 419–26.")). This scheme implies that _H. ergaster_ in Africa is ancestral to, or is a sister group to, _H. erectus_ in Asia. However, in this review, large-brained, large-bodied members of the genus _Homo_ found across the Old World are considered to display regional, not species-level, variation, and are all described as _H. erectus_ (following Antón [2003](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR2 "Antón SC. Natural history of Homo erectus. Yrbk Phys Anthropol. 2003;46:126–70.")). Under this hypothesis, regional variation in _H. erectus_ cranial features and body size, as in _H. sapiens_, are the result of drift, gene flow, and selection working differently in geographically dispersed populations.

The evolutionary lineage leading to later _Homo_, including Neanderthals and _H. sapiens_, split from a population of _H. erectus_, probably living in Africa. With future fossil discoveries across the Old World, this geographic interpretation for _H. erectus_ origins may change, but the phylogenetic hypothesis for its relationship to humans is unlikely to be overturned soon.

Identification and Morphology
-----------------------------

The genus _Homo_ originated some time between 3.0 and 2.5 million years ago (Grine and Fleagle [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR47 "Grine FE, Fleagle JG. The first humans: a summary perspective on the origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 197–207.")). Although there are no definitive specimens of _Homo_ from this time period, the _Homo_ lineage most likely diverged in Africa because the earliest putative _Homo_ fossils are all African.

Candidates for earliest _Homo_ (Kimbel [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR62 "Kimbel WH. The origin of Homo. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 31–7.")) include (a) Sts 19, a cranial fragment from Member 4 at Sterkfontein, South Africa dated to about 2.7–2.5 million years ago; (b) KNM-BC 1, a temporal bone fragment from the Chemeron Formation in Kenya dated to about 2.4 million years ago; (c) UR 501, a mandible with teeth from Uraha, Malawi dated to between 2.5 and 1.9 million years ago; (e) A.L. 666-1, a maxilla with teeth from the Hadar Formation in Ethiopia dated to about 2.3 million years ago; (f) teeth from the Shungura Formation, Ethiopia, dated to about 2.4–2.0 million years ago; (g) a partial cranium with teeth (attributed to _A. garhi_; Asfaw et al. [1999](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR6 "Asfaw B, White T, Lovejoy O, Latimer B, Simpson S, Suwa G. Australopithecus garhi: a new species of early hominin from Ethiopia. Science. 1999;284:629–35.")) and associated limb bones from the Hata Member, Bouri Formation of Ethiopia, dated to about 2.5 million years ago.

Another candidate for earliest _Homo_ has recently been announced. The remains of two partial skeletons from Malapa, South Africa, dated to 1.9 million years ago, have been attributed to _A. sediba_ (Berger et al. [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR10 "Berger LR, de Ruiter DJ, Churchill SE, Schmid P, Carlson KJ, Dirks PHGM, et al. Australopithecus sediba: a new species of Homo-like australopith from South Africa. Science. 2010;328:195–204.")), but their _Homo-_ like traits (e.g., small premolars and molars and derived bipedal traits in the pelvis and legs) beckon researchers to test the hypotheses that these finds belong either to the ancestor of _Homo_ or to the genus _Homo_.

None of the candidates for earliest _Homo_ lands firmly in the known range of anatomical variation for _H. habilis_, _H. rudolfensis_, or _H. erectus_. However, they all show arguable links to the genus _Homo_ and arguable differences from australopiths. Without the discovery of more fossils, these issues will not be resolved easily (Fig.[2](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#Fig2)).

Hard to find and even harder to recognize

In 1964, Louis Leakey, Philip Tobias, and John Napier were the first to tackle the question of where _Australopithecus_ ends and _Homo_ begins (Leakey et al. [1964](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR74 "Leakey LSB, Tobias PV, Napier JR. A new species of the genus Homo from Olduvai Gorge. Nature. 1964;202:7–9.")). The discovery of some associated cranial fragments, a mandible, and wrist and hand bones (OH 7; see Susman [2008](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR108 "Susman RL. Evidence bearing on the status of Homo habilis at Olduvai Gorge. Am J Phys Anthropol. 2008;137:356–61.")) from Bed I of Olduvai Gorge, dated to about 1.75 million years ago, spurred these authors to carve out a definition of the genus _Homo_ that accounted for its primitive beginnings in a brand new species _H. habilis_. Until this time, there were no specimens of early _Homo_ on record that were more primitive than _H. erectus_. Subsequently, there was a flood of early _Homo_ discoveries in East Africa (Leakey [1961](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR66 "Leakey LSB. New finds at Olduvai Gorge.

Am J Phys Anthropol. 1975;42:461–76."); Johanson et al. [1987](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR58 "Johanson DC, Masao FT, Eck GG, White TD, Walter RC, Kimbel WH, et al. New partial skeleton of Homo habilis from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. Nature. 1987;327:205–9.")). These new fossils contributed to the wide acceptance of _H. habilis_, but not until after 15 years of resistance (Tobias [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR114 "Tobias PV. Homo habilis—a premature discovery: remembered by one of its founding fathers, 42 years later. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 7–15.")).

Leakey, Tobias, and Napier argued that what they had found was not as large-brained or bodied as _H. erectus_, a species which was poorly known at the time, but it was not as primitive and apelike as the australopiths either. Thus, they laid some ground rules for what constituted the genus _Homo_. First of all, brain size had to be above 600 cubic centimeters, which is greater than in all known australopiths, as understood both then and now (Holloway [2000](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR50 "Holloway R. Brain. In: Delson E et al., editors. Encyclopedia of human evolution and prehistory. New York: Garland; 2000. p. 141–9.")). Plus, the bones of the skull had to be smooth and rounded, lacking the crests displayed on australopiths.

Beyond cranial morphology, the second criterion for belonging to the genus _Homo_, they argued, should be stone tool-making ability, which indicates an increase in behavioral and cognitive complexity associated with the larger brain. Although no one has discovered a fossil hominin skeleton holding a stone tool, those found near fossil hominins are attributed to them.

Leakey and colleagues also suggested that the face and mandible of the genus _Homo_ should be smaller than australopiths, more like _H. erectus_ and _H. sapiens_ and that the postcranial skeleton should resemble _H. sapiens_ (few postcranial elements of _H. erectus_ were known at the time). The partially preserved foot skeleton (OH 8) showed that _H. habilis_ had fully adapted feet for walking bipedally, unlike preceding australopiths, which still had some primitive traits (like a slightly divergent big toe) despite their regular upright locomotion.

These standards were useful at a time when the fossil record was sparse and, thus, told a simpler story. But now that the fossil record has grown and the picture has become much more complex, these first standards for early _Homo_ are no longer as effective for sorting out which fossils belong to the genus _Homo_ and which belong to other genera.

Part of the difficulty lies in the parts preserved. None of the late Pliocene candidates for earliest _Homo_ preserves the means for estimating brain size, so there is no way of tracking brain size expansion in the fossil record at this time. Moreover, the only two candidates for earliest _Homo_ that preserve postcranial elements have already been attributed to _Australopithecus_ despite the presence of some derived anatomical trends compared to australopiths (e.g., the humanlike humerofemoral length index of the Bouri remains; Asfaw et al. [1999](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR6 "Asfaw B, White T, Lovejoy O, Latimer B, Simpson S, Suwa G. Australopithecus garhi: a new species of early hominin from Ethiopia. Science. 1999;284:629–35.")). The only candidate for earliest _Homo_ to be recovered in loose association with stone tools (not the tools themselves, but butchered bones) has been attributed to _Australopithecus_. This behavioral criterion may be the weakest of all of the original standards since the earliest tools on record, from as early as 2.6 million years ago in Gona, Ethiopia (Semaw et al. [1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR100 "Semaw S, Renne P, Harris JWK, Feibel CS, Bernor RL, Fesseha N, et al. 2.5-million-year-old stone tools from Gona, Ethiopia. Science. 1997;284:625–9."), [2003](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR101 "Semaw S, Rogers MJ, Quade J, Renne PR, Butler RF, Dominguez-Rodrigo M, et al. 2.6-million-year-old stone tools and associated bones from OGS-6 and OGS-7, Gona, Afar, Ethiopia. J Hum Evol. 2003;45(2):169–77.")), predate the candidates for earliest _Homo_ by at least 100,000 years. What is more, the earliest stone tools do not exactly track brain size evolution since they predate the earliest evidence for significantly larger brains by at least 700,000 years.

Drastic changes—such as the full-body adaptation to bipedalism and the development of a larger brain—would be more conspicuously played out in the fossil record if more creatures were preserved as complete individuals. In reality, paleontologists are given only bits and pieces with which to reconstruct the experiment that nature performed millions of years ago. As a result of the imperfect preservation of the fossil record, most specimens of early _Homo_ are teeth, jaws, and skull fragments, the anatomy of which cannot directly or easily speak to bipedalism or brain size.

Teeth are the most abundant items in the fossil record. Tooth enamel is made of a durable substance, hydroxyapatite, which is much better at withstanding the chemical and physical degradation that occurs during the fossilization process than bones are. Fortunately, teeth also evolve and adapt relatively rapidly, so paleontologists can use tooth morphology to diagnose species—like _H. habilis_, _H. rudolfensis_, and _H. erectus_—without needing to find complete skulls or entire skeletons.

To recognize that a tooth or jaw from the late Pliocene and onward is a member of the genus _Homo_ and not _Australopithecus_ or _Paranthropus_, it must be more humanlike and less apelike than those genera. This suite of traits includes smaller teeth overall, relatively smaller molars and premolars compared to the incisors, further reduced canines than earlier hominins, thick enamel, and a parabolic dental arcade. That is, the teeth form a horseshoe shape rather than a v-shape or a u-shape, as in earlier hominins and in nonhuman apes. As described below, particular features of the dentition, the jaws, the cranium, the cranial capacity, and the postcranial morphology distinguish _H. habilis_, _H. rudolfensis_, and _H. erectus_ from one another.

### _Homo habilis_

_H. habilis_ was a small-bodied biped, with a brain larger than _Australopithecus_ and _Paranthropus_, averaging over 600 cubic centimeters. However, because of some crania like KNM-ER 1813 which has a cranial capacity of only 510 cubic centimeters, the range of variation overlaps with the other genera (Holloway [1983](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR49 "Holloway RL. Human paleontological evidence relevant to language behavior. Hum Neurobiol. 1983;2:105–14."); Miller [1990](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR82 "Miller JA. Does brain size variability provide evidence of multiple species in Homo habilis? Am J Phys Anthropol. 1990;84(4):385–98.")).

Despite its small brain size, KNM-ER 1813 shares features with other, larger-brained cranial representatives of _H. habilis_ (e.g., OH 24) that characterize the species: the roundness of the brain case, the small size of the orbits, and the degree of prognathism or projection below the nose, which is still more pronounced in _H. habilis_ than in later _Homo_. Like its australopith ancestors, _H. habilis_ still had large teeth, some specimens rivaling australopiths, but the molars are narrower and the third molars are reduced in size (Wood [1992](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR124 "Wood BA. Origin and evolution of the genus Homo. Nature. 1992;355:783–90.")).

Body size and limb proportions that have been reconstructed from the partial _H. habilis_ skeleton from Olduvai Gorge (OH 62; Johanson et al. [1987](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR58 "Johanson DC, Masao FT, Eck GG, White TD, Walter RC, Kimbel WH, et al. New partial skeleton of Homo habilis from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania. Nature. 1987;327:205–9.")) are unlike _H. erectus_ (Larson [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR64 "Larson SG. Evolution of the hominin shoulder: early Homo. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 65–75.")). However, this individual is so fragmentary that it is often disregarded in analyses of hominin body size (Jungers [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR59 "Jungers WL. Interlimb proportions in humans and fossil hominins: variability and scaling. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 93–8.")). In general, body mass estimates are difficult to make, given the paucity of postcranial fossils for this species, but a generally accepted estimate is 34 kilograms (75 pounds), and this is smaller than estimates for _Australopithecus_ and _Paranthropus_ (which fall between 36 and 44 kilograms or 79 and 97 pounds) and are much smaller than those for _H. erectus_ (which fall between 56 and 75 kilograms or 123 and 165 pounds; Ruff et al. [1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR98 "Ruff CB, Trinkaus E, Holliday TW. Body mass and encephalization in Pleistocene Homo. Nature. 1997;387:173–6.")).

This small-bodied species also had long arms and retained some features seen in earlier hominins, linked to remnant arboreal behaviors. Shoulder elements from Olduvai Gorge (OH 48) and Koobi Fora (KNM-ER 3735) show that _H. habilis_ retained primitive australopith-like morphology and was unlike all other _Homo_ (Larson [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR64 "Larson SG. Evolution of the hominin shoulder: early Homo. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 65–75.")). That the postcranial morphology of _H. habilis_ is not humanlike, nor is it even _H. erectus_-like, is the reason why debate persists over its degree of arboreality and its adaptations for climbing (Ruff [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR97 "Ruff C. Relative limb strength and locomotion in Homo habilis. Am J Phys Anthropol. 2009;138:90–100."); Carlson et al.

The locomotor repertoire of early Homo: insights from chimpanzee variation. Am J Phys Anthropol. 2010;Suppl 50:42.")).

### _Homo rudolfensis_

Very little is known about _H. rudolfensis_. The species is only represented by a toothless cranium from Koobi Fora, Kenya (KNM-ER 1470) and a mandible from Malawi (UR 501). The cranial capacity of KNM-ER 1470 is estimated at 752 cubic centimeters (Holloway [1983](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR49 "Holloway RL. Human paleontological evidence relevant to language behavior. Hum Neurobiol. 1983;2:105–14.")), and although the teeth are not preserved, the alveoli (or tooth sockets) are large, reflecting the large teeth they once contained. Some postcranial elements have been attributed to the species by some researchers, but there is weak general support for this practice. As more and more _H. habilis_ and _H. erectus_ fossils are discovered, there are increasing calls for KNM-ER 1470 to be subsumed into _H. habilis_ (Fig.[3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#Fig3)) and the status of _H. rudolfensis_ as a valid, distinct species of early _Homo_ is open for debate (Tobias [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR114 "Tobias PV. Homo habilis—a premature discovery: remembered by one of its founding fathers, 42 years later. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 7–15."); Baab [2008a](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR7 "Baab KL. The taxonomic implications of cranial shape variation in Homo erectus. J Hum Evol. 2008a;54:827–47.")). Future discoveries will certainly help answer questions about this species.

### _Homo erectus_

Determined to find the “missing link”, Dutch anatomist Eugene Dubois discovered the first remains of _H. erectus_ along the Trinil River on the island of Java, Indonesia (Dubois [1894](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR33 "Dubois E. Pithecanthropus erectus, ein menschenahnliche Ubergangsform aus Java. Batavia: Landesdruckerei; 1894."), [1924](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR34 "Dubois E. Figures of the calvarium and endocranial cast, a fragment of the mandible and three teeth of Pithecanthropus erectus. Proc K Ned Akad Wet. 1924;27:459–64.")). Formerly called _Pithecanthropus erectus_, the skull cap (just the top of the brain case and the browridges) looked small and primitive, especially since there were no australopiths yet on record with which to compare it (see Dunsworth and Walker [2002](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR36 "Dunsworth HM, Walker A. Early genus Homo. In: Hartwig W, editor. The primate fossil record. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; 2002. p. 419–26.")). However, the femur that was associated with the skull cap clearly belonged to an erect, large-bodied hominin.

Subsequent to Dubois’ expedition, many more _H. erectus_ fossils have been collected from Indonesia (e.g., Sartono [1972](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR99 "Sartono S.

However, far and away the best single specimen of _H. erectus_ is a nearly complete skeleton of a boy from the site of Nariokotome in West Turkana, Kenya (Brown et al.

With larger bodies, larger brains, and smaller teeth, most _H. erectus_ fossils are distinct from the other two species of early _Homo_. _H. erectus_ teeth are smaller than _H. habilis_ and _H. rudolfensis_, and although the early specimens have large teeth, tooth size decreases through time in the species. The upper incisors of many specimens are shovel-shaped, and this is seen in some modern humans.

_H. erectus_ crania are distinct from _H. habilis_ first and foremost by their larger brain size (700–1,300 cubic centimeters), which begins small and increases through time. They have a thicker browridge which sometimes forms a bony shelf called a supra-orbital torus, and the frontal bone, above the browridge, recedes toward the back. The overall shape of the _H. erectus_ cranium is long and low (like an American football) compared to a round _H. sapiens_ cranium (which is relatively more like a soccer ball), and the widest breadth of the _H. erectus_ cranium is near the ears, which is lower than it is in humans. _H. erectus_ also has a strong torus on the occipital bone at the back of the skull and sometimes has a bony keel running up through the middle of the frontal bone and/or the sagittal suture on the top of the skull. In general, the bones of _H. erectus_ crania are very thick and nearly twice as thick as _H. sapiens_. Asian _H. erectus_ (or “_H. erectus_ sensu stricto”) crania display the above-described cranial architecture more prominently and, as a group, more than _H. erectus_ from other parts of the world. These embellished cranial keels and tori could be developmentally linked to the enhanced brain size that occurs in Asian _H. erectus_ (Spoor et al. [2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR107 "Spoor F, Leakey M, Gathogo P, Brown F, Antón S, McDougall I, et al. Implications of new early Homo fossils from Ileret, east of Lake Turkana, Kenya. Nature. 2007;448:688–91.")).

Although he was not fully grown, the skeleton of the Nariokotome boy (KNM-WT 15000) has provided much insight into the paleobiology of _H. erectus_ (Dean and Smith [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR30 "Dean MC, Smith BH. Growth and development of the Nariokotome youth, KNM-ET 15000. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 101–20.")). According to the pattern of ossification of the ends of his long bones (also known as the fusion of his growth plates), his age at death is estimated to have been at 13 years old. However, the microscopic growth increments in his teeth indicate that he was only 8 years old when he died. Together, this evidence suggests that _H. erectus_ grew up faster than _H. sapiens_ (but slower than apes) and therefore achieved benchmarks of growth earlier than modern humans. Moreover, the _H. erectus_ growth curve probably lacked the slowdown, followed by an adolescent growth spurt, typical in humans. The Nariokotome boy, at 8 years old, was probably as behaviorally independent and mature as a young human adult, not an 8-year-old human, so _H. erectus_ had a life history unlike anything alive today (Dean and Smith [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR30 "Dean MC, Smith BH. Growth and development of the Nariokotome youth, KNM-ET 15000. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 101–20.")).

Standing about 160 centimeters (which is five feet three inches; but for a shorter estimate, see Ohman et al. [2000](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR86 "Ohman JC, Wood C, Wood B, Crompton RH, Günther MM, Yu L, et al. Stature-at-death of KNM-WT 15000. Hum Evol. 2000;17(3–4):129–41.")), he weighed an estimated 50 kilograms (about 100 pounds). Depending on the growth model used, as an adult, he may have stood 163 centimeters (five feet four inches) tall and weighed 56 kilograms (123 pounds; Graves et al. [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR46 "Graves RR, McCarthy RC, Lupo AC, Wescott DJ, Cunningham DL. New estimates of stature and body mass for KNM-WT 15000. Am J Phys Anthropol. 2010;Suppl 50:106–7.")), which is in line with estimates from adult _H. erectus_ specimens OH 28 and Trinil of about 57 kilograms. However, on the other end of the spectrum in this debate which is currently unfolding, he is hypothesized to have much more growth to achieve, and by adulthood, and he would have stood 175 centimeters (five feet nine inches) and weighed 75 kilograms (165 pounds; Gibbons [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR44 "Gibbons A. Human ancestor caught in the midst of a makeover. Science. 2010;328:413.")).

The shoulder anatomy of KNM-WT 15000 shows a more humanlike orientation of the glenoid fossa of the scapula. That is, it is less cranially oriented like in earlier hominins and apes (a feature that is linked to climbing and brachiating (or arm-swinging) in trees), but because the clavicle is relatively short, the angle of the shoulder joint is still different than in modern humans. Instead of facing laterally (as in humans), the glenoid fossa in _H. erectus_ is anteriorly oriented (Larson [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR64 "Larson SG. Evolution of the hominin shoulder: early Homo. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 65–75.")). Although manipulation would not be hindered, the range of motion at the shoulder may have been limited by this scapular configuration combined with the low level of humeral head torsion. This is new, strong evidence against the notion that _H. erectus_ could throw like a modern human (Larson [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR64 "Larson SG. Evolution of the hominin shoulder: early Homo. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 65–75.")), as discussed by earlier workers (Calvin [1983](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR22 "Calvin WH. The throwing Madonna: essays on the brain. New York: Bantam; 1983."); Bingham [1999](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR11 "Bingham PM. Human uniqueness: a general theory. Q Rev Biol. 1999;74:122–69."); Dunsworth et al. [2003](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR37 "Dunsworth HM, Challis JH, Walker A. Throwing and bipedalism: a new look at an old idea. In: Franzen JL, Dohler M, Moya-Sola S, editors. Upright walking. Frankfurt: Senckenberg Institute; 2003. p. 105–10.")).

Behavior
--------

Encephalization (an increase in brain size relative to body size) is a well-known trend in many evolutionary lineages. However, no other lineage experienced the degree of encephalization seen in humans today. This trend began in early _Homo_ and is exhibited throughout the evolution of _H. erectus_. Hypotheses for encephalization in _Homo_ include environmental pressure, predator pressure, social pressure, the opportunities created by dexterous hands, freed from a locomotor role, dietary pressure, the nutritional opportunities created by the increase of meat and marrow in the diet, or a combination of factors. No matter what the selective pressures were, increased brain size is associated with increased behavioral complexity.

The best evidence for behavior complexity in early _Homo_ comes from the archaeological remains and artifacts associated with hominin fossils. _H. habilis_, the so-called “handyman,” as the Latin name is translated, is credited as the first tool maker. These hominins fashioned primitive stone implements, which are dubbed the Oldowan industry for their initial discovery in Olduvai Gorge. Crude Oldowan artifacts, like choppers, flakes, cores, and hammerstones, are rarely associated with zooarchaeological evidence for carnivory (Roche et al. [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR96 "Roche H, Blumenschine RJ, Shea JJ. Origins and adaptations of early Homo: what archaeology tells us. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 135–47.")). Moreover, for obtaining meat, early _Homo_ probably scavenged animal carcasses more than it hunted prey. The geographically and temporally widespread use of Oldowan and eventually Acheulean tools suggests that they were used for much more than butchery (Roche et al. [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR96 "Roche H, Blumenschine RJ, Shea JJ. Origins and adaptations of early Homo: what archaeology tells us. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 135–47.")). For example, stone tools would have been useful for obtaining and processing plant materials as well. The Oldowan industry, although primitive and simple, showed changed through time and variation in flake production (Roche et al. [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR96 "Roche H, Blumenschine RJ, Shea JJ. Origins and adaptations of early Homo: what archaeology tells us. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 135–47."); Braun et al. [2008a](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR17 "Braun DR, Plummer T, Ditchfield P, Ferraro JV, Maina D, Bishop LC, et al. Oldowan behavior and raw material transport: perspectives from the Kanjera formation. J Arch Sci. 2008a;35:2329–45."), [b](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR18 "Braun DR, Tactikos JC, Ferraro JV, Arnow SL, Harris JWK. Oldowan reduction sequences: methodological considerations. J Arch Sci. 2008b;35:2153–63.")), especially through the technological transition to the Acheulean tradition.

Manufacturing tools out of stones is a behavior that no one has been able to link definitively to early _Homo_ to the exclusion of other hominins. _Paranthropus_ fossils are found at some _H. habilis_ sites like those at Olduvai Gorge. _Paranthropus_ may have had the necessary hand anatomy for gripping stones and stone tools precisely and strongly enough to make them and to use them just like _Homo_. However, there is no clear evidence that the genus regularly engaged in stone tool-making behavior, and this notion is supported by the lack of impact that the extinction of _Paranthropus_ made on the archaeological record (Roche et al. [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR96 "Roche H, Blumenschine RJ, Shea JJ. Origins and adaptations of early Homo: what archaeology tells us. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 135–47.")).

To make matters more complicated, the earliest stone tools were discovered from 2.6 million year-old sediments in Gona, Ethiopia (Semaw et al. [2003](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR101 "Semaw S, Rogers MJ, Quade J, Renne PR, Butler RF, Dominguez-Rodrigo M, et al. 2.6-million-year-old stone tools and associated bones from OGS-6 and OGS-7, Gona, Afar, Ethiopia. J Hum Evol. 2003;45(2):169–77.")), and cut-marked bones were collected near the remains of _A. garhi_ in Ethiopia (de Heinzelin et al. [1999](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR29 "de Heinzelin J, Clark JD, White T, Hart W, Renne P, WoldeGabriel G, et al. Environment and behavior of 2.5-million-year-old Bouri hominids. Science. 1999;284:625–9.")), preceding the earliest _Homo_ specimens by at least 100,000 years. Of course none of this evidence definitely attributes Oldowan stone tool production to australopiths, but it does put the onus on paleontologists to find earlier specimens of _H. habilis_, if the species can continue to claim the distinction of first stone tool maker.

Following the Oldowan, stone tools became more diverse and more complex or difficult to manufacture, and the tradition was in full swing by about 1.5 million years ago. This next technological phase in the lithic record is the Acheulean, and _H. erectus_ is best associated with these tools in Africa. This new technology features, for example, teardrop-shaped bifaces called “handaxes” (Fig.[5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#Fig5)). Showing no signs that they were hafted to handles, yet being circumscribed with sharp edges, handaxes were probably used to process plant materials and to skin and butcher animals. The small, delicate but sharp flakes that were produced during handaxe production were perfect for squeezing between thumb and forefinger in fine, precision cutting maneuvers.

The more advanced Acheulean tools—named for the site in France where they were initially discovered—are much more difficult to create than Oldowan tools, which look like bashed rocks to non-experts, despite the intention and cognitive power behind their creation. Acheulean bifaces, handaxes, and cleavers, on the other hand, are impossible to dismiss as mere broken rocks and are linked to increased cognitive and behavioral complexity in the hominins that made them.

Handaxes are not found at the early Pleistocene _H. erectus_ sites of Dmanisi, Georgia. In fact, they are rarely found east of India despite the success of _H. erectus_ in these regions. Perhaps the _H. erectus_ that dispersed to East and Southeast Asia left before the technology was adopted in the west. Perhaps these hominins took up different traditions using raw materials that do not preserve as well. For now the debate continues about this east-versus-west phenomenon, which is divided by the “Movius Line” named after the archaeologist who first observed the pattern (Movius [1948](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR84 "Movius HL. The Lower Palaeolithic cultures of southern and eastern Asia. Trans Am Philos Soc. 1948;38:329–420.")). However, handaxes, or at least handaxe-like artifacts, recovered from Chinese sites dating to about 800 thousand years ago complicate the picture (Hou et al. [2000](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR51 "Hou YM, Potts R, Yuan BY, et al. Mid-Pleistocene Acheulean-like stone technology of the Bose Basin, South China. Science. 2000;287:1622–6."); Wang et al. [2008](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR121 "Wang W, Mo JY, Huang ZT.

The Movius Line sensu lato (Norton et al. 2006) further assessed and defined. J Hum Evol. 2008;55:1148–50.")).

With the improvement in stone tool technology, there is also anatomical evidence that _H. erectus_ underwent a dietary shift toward increased carnivory. The cusps on _H. erectus_ molars are steeper than those in australopiths, and this dental topography would have been useful for shearing meat (Ungar [2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR116 "Ungar P. Dental topography and diets of Australopithecus afarensis and early Homo. J Hum Evol. 2004;46:605–22.")) or fracturing tough foods in general (Unger and Scott [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR117 "Unger PS, Scott RS. Dental evidence for diets of early Homo. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 121–34.")). The evidence from studies of dental microwear, though, does not fully support that early _Homo_ was eating a diet of tough foods. In general, however, dental evidence is consistent with a diet that was variable according to the variable environments in which these hominins were living (Unger and Scott [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR117 "Unger PS, Scott RS. Dental evidence for diets of early Homo. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 121–34.")).

As mentioned above, the Plio–Pleistocene transition marks a sweeping change in the East African environment, caused by global climate changes (deMenocal [2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR32 "deMenocal PB. African climate change and faunal evolution during the Pliocene–Pleistocene.

Plio–Pleistocene East African pulsed climate variability and its influence on early human evolution. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 151–8.")). Pulses of climate variability during this period are hypothesized to be linked to species turnover in the mammalian fossil record and to the evolution, variation, and adaptation of Plio–Pleistocene hominins (Maslin and Trauth [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR81 "Maslin MA, Trauth MH.

New Haven: Yale University Press; 1995."); Potts [1998a](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR88 "Potts R. Environmental hypotheses of hominin evolution. Yrbk Phys Anthropol. 1998a;41:93–136."), [b](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR89 "Potts R. Variability selection in hominid evolution. Evol Anthropol. 1998b;7:81–96.")). On a smaller scale, it is evident that early _Homo_ populations experienced environmental variability.

The cooler Plio–Pleistocene climate opened up the African forests to the kinds of savanna grasslands that are now widespread in sub-Saharan Africa. These early savannas were populated with large grazing herbivores that became regular meals for _H. erectus_ - probably the first hominin to be keenly adapted to these non-forested environments (Reed [1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR91 "Reed KE. Early hominid evolution and ecological change through the African Plio–Pleistocene. J Hum Evol. 1997;32:289–322.")). Arid, seasonally wet and dry habitats were already occupied by earliest _Homo_ between 2.5 and 2.0 million years ago, and after that hominins preferred increasingly open and wetter grasslands (Reed and Russak [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR92 "Reed KE, Russak SM. Tracking ecological change in relation to the emergence of Homo near the Plio–Pleistocene boundary. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 159–71.")). Butchered turtles, crocodiles, and fish at a 1.9 million years-old site in Koobi Fora (Braun et al. [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR19 "Braun DR, Harris JWK, Levin NE, McCoy JT, Herries AIR, Bishop BMK, et al. Early hominin diet included diverse terrestrial and aquatic animals 1.95 Ma in East Turkana, Kenya. PNAS. 2010;107(22):10002–7.")) support this paleoenvironmental interpretation. Although this particular evidence pre-dates _H. erectus_, analyses of Ethiopian and South African mammalian fossil assemblages—for example, reconstruction of community composition and biogeochemical analysis of tooth enamel—link the appearance and spread of _H. erectus_ to a marked shift toward increased grasslands and, in general, more open and wetter landscapes (Bobe and Leakey [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR15 "Bobe R, Leakey MG. Ecology of the Plio–Pleistocene mammals in the Omo-Turkana Basin and the emergence of Homo. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo.

Biogeochemical evidence for the environments of early Homo in South Africa. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 185–94.")).

Further zooarchaeological evidence supports that _H. erectus_ incorporated animal protein into its diet. Cut marks from stone tools on large mammal bones are distinct from marks left by the teeth of carnivores like big cats, and cut-marked and butchered bones increase in prevalence around the appearance of _H. erectus_ and in association with Acheulean artifacts (Roche et al. [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR96 "Roche H, Blumenschine RJ, Shea JJ. Origins and adaptations of early Homo: what archaeology tells us. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 135–47.")). The dispersal of the species beyond the African continent, the development of a much larger roaming range, and the increase in body size are consistent with a shift to a more carnivorous and possibly a predatory model for _H. erectus_ behavior and biology (Shipman and Walker [1989](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR104 "Shipman P, Walker A. The costs of becoming a predator. J Hum Evol. 1989;18:373–92.")).

These early scavengers and hunters did not yet behave completely like later species of _Homo_. With the earliest known evidence for fire use at about 780,000 years ago in Israel (Goren-Inbar et al. [2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR45 "Goren-Inbar N, Alperson N, Kislev ME, Simchoni O, Melamed Y, Ben-Nun A, et al. Evidence of hominin control of fire at Gesher Benot Ya`aqov, Israel. Science. 2004;304(5671):725–7.")), there is a long gap between the onset of meat-eating and evidence for cooking ability. Furthermore and as mentioned above, _H. erectus_ may not have possessed the ability to successfully incorporate projectiles into its hunting strategy; although its body was adapted for bipedalism, its shoulder was not yet built for the complex and difficult task of overarm throwing (Larson et al. [2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR65 "Larson SG, Jungers WL, Morwood MJ, Sutikna T, Jatmiko SEW, Due RA, et al. Homo floresiensis and the evolution of the hominin shoulder. J Hum Evol. 2007;53(6):718–31.")). Moreover, there are no undisputed, specialized projectile weapons (like spears) associated with _H. erectus_. Anatomical, physiological, and behavioral adaptations for hunting and scavenging evolved over the past two million years from simple beginnings, which may perhaps be modeled after wild chimpanzees that thrust pointed sticks at sleeping prosimians (Pruetz and Bertolani [2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR90 "Pruetz JD, Bertolani P. Savanna chimpanzees, Pan troglodytes verus, hunt with tools. Curr Biol. 2007;17:1–6.")).

The ability to run for long distances would have been a tremendous advantage in scavenging and hunting, especially if _H. erectus_ did not possess effective throwing ability. Hallmarks of the _H. erectus_ skeleton such as long legs, a narrow flexible waist, and short forearms seem to be adaptations for such intense endurance activity, and these traits appear before the invention of sophisticated projectile hunting weapons (Bramble and Lieberman [2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR16 "Bramble DM, Lieberman DE. Endurance running and the evolution of Homo. Nature. 2004;432:345–52."); Lieberman et al. [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR76 "Lieberman DE, Bramble DM, Raichlen DA, Shea JJ. Brains, brawn, and the evolution of human endurance running capabilities. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 77–92.")). Other traits found in _H. erectus_ fossils that are consistent with running adaptations including larger anterior and posterior semicircular canals (the parts of the inner ear that coordinate with the eyes to accommodate for head movement), a large attachment for the nuchal ligament on the back of the skull (to aid in head stability), larger gluteal muscles (as reconstructed from the bony pelvis), and enlarged lumbar vertebral bodies and leg joints (for withstanding impact; Bramble and Lieberman [2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR16 "Bramble DM, Lieberman DE.

In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 77–92.")). Adaptations for endurance running would also have benefited the evolution of throwing ability and may have been exaptive for humanlike throwing (Larson [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR64 "Larson SG. Evolution of the hominin shoulder: early Homo. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 65–75.")).

Preserved footprints from the Ileret region east of Lake Turkana show that _H. erectus_ feet were just as well designed for walking and running as the rest of the body (Bennett et al. [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR9 "Bennett MR, Harris JWK, Richmond BG, Braun DR, Muba E, Kiura P, et al. Early hominin foot morphology based on 1.5-million-year-old footprints from Ileret, Kenya. Science. 2009;323(5918):1197–201.")). Scavenging would have been easier with endurance running capabilities, but the success rate at hunting down medium-to-large game would have significantly improved thanks to persistence (Lieberman et al. [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR76 "Lieberman DE, Bramble DM, Raichlen DA, Shea JJ. Brains, brawn, and the evolution of human endurance running capabilities. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 77–92.")). With all of this foraging activity out on the open, sun-scorched savanna, it would have been imperative that _H. erectus_ could regulate its temperature; this is when intense sweat cooling, aided by body fur loss, may have originated (Jablonski [2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR57 "Jablonski NG. The evolution of human skin and skin color. Ann Rev Anthropol. 2004;33:585–623.")). Molecular phylogenetics of body lice (Reed et al. [2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR93 "Reed DL, Light JE, Allen JM, Kirchman JJ. Pair of lice lost or parasites regained: the evolutionary history of anthropoid primate lice. BMC Biol. 2007;5:7.")) or another innovative research avenue may soon provide a date for the drastic reduction of body fur in hominins.

Current Debates
---------------

### What Exactly Is the Genus _Homo_?

Part of what inhibits a consensus on what constitutes the genus _Homo_ (and this applies to debates about the validity of many fossil taxa) is the fact that, as in all of the great apes, there are no new discrete anatomical traits that appear or disappear in _Homo—_ at least none that fossilize—that were absent or present in preceding hominins. There are only new trends in _Homo_. With no exclusive differences by which to distinguish _Homo_ from earlier hominins, the node connecting their separate evolutionary branches is blurry, and with each new discovery, it becomes blurrier.

Some early _Homo_ fossils (and early _Homo_ candidates) link to some dental traits of australopiths and some postcranial traits of later _Homo_, while others link to some dental traits of _Homo_ yet retain more primitive postcranial morphology. Some isolated teeth and jaws look more primitive while others look more derived. It is difficult to sort out the evolutionary relationships of early _Homo_ fossils.

As a result, there is some disagreement regarding the genus attribution of the _habilis_ and _rudolfensis_ material and, by extension, the definition of the genus _Homo_. Under a new definition of _Homo_ offered by Wood and Collard ([1999](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR127 "Wood B, Collard M. The human genus. Science. 1999;284:65–71."); Wood [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR126 "Wood BA. Where does the genus Homo begin, and how would we know? In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 17–28.")), all members display traits of a single adaptive complex that are manifested in body size and shape, locomotion, and relative size of the teeth and jaws. Therefore, if fossils designated as _Homo_ must be more like humans than australopiths, then, according to some researchers, specimens belonging to _H. habilis_ and _H. rudolfensis_ fit better in _Australopithecus_. If this scheme is followed, then _H. erectus_ fossils are the earliest _Homo_ on record.

However, as _H. habilis_ remains the best candidate ancestor for all later species of _Homo_, this is strong evidence for an ancestry or clade-based definition of the genus that includes _habilis_ (Kimbel [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR62 "Kimbel WH. The origin of Homo. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 31–7.")). This scheme is still currently followed by the majority of paleontologists. It is not yet clear if any of the traits of the aforementioned adaptive complex were significant to the origin of the genus _Homo_, but that does not diminish the evidence or weaken the case for its start at the end of the Pliocene (Kimbel [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR62 "Kimbel WH. The origin of Homo. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 31–7.")).

### How Much Overlap Between Species and How Much Variation Within Species?

In 2007, Spoor et al. ([2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR107 "Spoor F, Leakey M, Gathogo P, Brown F, Antón S, McDougall I, et al. Implications of new early Homo fossils from Ileret, east of Lake Turkana, Kenya. Nature. 2007;448:688–91.")) announced two fossils from the site of Ileret, Kenya, on the eastern side of Lake Turkana. One was a _H. erectus_ cranium (KNM-ER 42700) and the other a _H. habilis_ maxilla (KNM-ER 42703), and they each contributed toward a potentially new understanding of early _Homo_.

First, the _H. habilis_ maxilla, from 1.4 million years ago, extends the known existence of that species 400,000 years past the first appearance of _H. erectus_. As long as the maxilla really is _H. habilis_, then this implies that the two species lived sympatrically (living the same place) in the Turkana Basin for a half-million years and that all that separated the smaller-bodied _H. habilis_ from the bigger _H. erectus_ may have been a dietary or foraging difference.

Under a Darwinian model of speciation, one would expect to find that some _H. habilis_ would continue evolving after a small subpopulation had branched off to later become _H. erectus_. However, these fossils represent another example of separate hominin species preferring similar geographic regions and potentially similar environments. Obviously there is no such species overlap today, but in our evolutionary past, there were at least three instances where two or more hominins most likely overlapped in space and time: (a) robust australopiths (_Paranthropus_) and early _Homo_ in East and South Africa, (b) Neanderthals and _H. sapiens_ in Europe, and (c) _Homo floresiensis_ (the so-called “hobbits”) and _H. sapiens_ in Indonesia. Now, with the new Ileret finds, _H. habilis_ and _H. erectus_ may be added to that list.

The morphology of the second fossil announced by Spoor et al. as the _H. erectus_ cranium opens up a completely different can of worms. It is small and primitive. Thus, if it is indeed _H. erectus_, it expands the known range of variation on the small end for the species. However, its attribution to _H. erectus_ has been questioned (Baab [2008b](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR8 "Baab KL. A re-evaluation of the taxonomic affinities of the early Homo cranium KNM-ER 42700. J Hum Evol. 2008b;55:741–6.")).

Understanding the level of variation within _H. erectus_ is important for many reasons, one being the estimation of sexual dimorphism—a trait that has major implications for how we reconstruct social and reproductive behavior. Along the hominin evolutionary path, sexual dimorphism has decreased. Males and females were more disparate in body size than men and women are today, implying that past hominin social and reproductive strategies were apelike in comparison to ours. Until recently, it was assumed that the modern level of sexual dimorphism—with males and females being fairly similar in body size and tooth size—was achieved by _H. erectus_. New discoveries like the Ileret cranium, which is smaller than regional and contemporaneous conspecifics, and like the small Dmanisi individuals which show a large size range within a single species (Baab [2008b](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR8 "Baab KL. A re-evaluation of the taxonomic affinities of the early Homo cranium KNM-ER 42700. J Hum Evol. 2008b;55:741–6."); Rightmire and Lordkipanidze [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR94 "Rightmire GP, Lordkipanidze D. Comparisons of early Pleistocene skulls from East Africa and the Georgian Caucasus: evidence bearing on the origin and systematics of genus Homo. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 39–48."); but see Gabunia et al. [2002](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR43 "Gabunia L, Vekua AK, de Lumly MA, Lordkipanidze D. A new species of Homo represented by a fossil from the bottom part of the Pleistocene layer at Dmanisi, Georgia. Archaeol Ethnol Anthropol Eurasia. 2002;4:145–52.")) are causing scholars to rethink traditional assumptions about _H. erectus_ sexual dimorphism.

Once hominins achieve modern human levels of dimorphism, it may be hypothesized that modern reproductive strategies evolved as well. Normally pair-bonding between a male and female—including a particularly large increase in paternal investment as compared to previous hominins and to extant primates—is deemed necessary to raise highly vulnerable offspring such as large-brained, vulnerable, and slow-to-mature babies, like human babies. Pair-bonded primates tend to have low levels of sexual dimorphism since male–male competition for mates is decreased. However, with relatively small brains compared to modern humans, _H. erectus_ young were not growing up as slowly as humans (Dean and Smith [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR30 "Dean MC, Smith BH. Growth and development of the Nariokotome youth, KNM-ET 15000. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 101–20.")), so selection may not yet have favored increased paternal investment and pair-bonding behavior. If researchers determine that _H. erectus_ had higher levels of sexual dimorphism than modern humans, then this will imply that they experienced higher male–male competition for mates than our more recent ancestors. However, until there are sufficient numbers of specimens recovered from sufficient numbers of sites—both from similar ages and regions and also across time and space—such an estimate will be difficult to establish firmly.

### Did _H. erectus_ Originate Outside of Africa?

Based on geochronology of volcanic rocks at the site, the _H. erectus_ fossils from Dmanisi, Georgia have been dated to about 1.78 million years ago (Gabunia et al. [2000](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR42 "Gabunia L, Vekua A, Lordkipanidze D, Swisher CC, Ferring R, Justus A, et al.

The site of Mojokerto in Indonesia may be just as old (Swisher et al. [1994](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR109 "Swisher CC, Curtis GH, Jacob T, Getty AG, Suprijo A, Widiasmoro. Age of the earliest known hominids in Java, Indonesia. Science. 1994;263(5150):1118–21."); Huffman et al. [2006](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR54 "Huffman OF, Zaim Y, Kappelman J, Ruez DR Jr, de Vos J, Rizal Y, et al. Relocation of the 1936 Mojokerto skull discovery site near Perning, East Java. J Hum Evol. 2006;50:431–51.")); and, along with Dmanisi, these sites preserve the early appearances of _H. erectus_ outside of Africa. Remarkably, their ages coincide with the first appearance of _H. erectus_ within Africa (e.g., the cranium KNM-ER 3733 dated to about 1.78 million years ago; Feibel et al. [1989](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR40 "Feibel C, Brown FH, McDougall I. Stratigraphic context of fossil hominids from the Omo group deposits: Northern Turkana Basin, Kenya and Ethiopia. Am J Phys Anthropol. 1989;78(4):595–622.")), where the taxon presumably originated.

The Dmanisi fossils (Fig.[6](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#Fig6)), although attributed to _H. erectus_, do not share some key features with conspecifics in Africa and Asia, yet they do share some primitive features with _H. habilis_, like KNM-ER 1813 and OH 13 (Rightmire and Lordkipanidze [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR94 "Rightmire GP, Lordkipanidze D. Comparisons of early Pleistocene skulls from East Africa and the Georgian Caucasus: evidence bearing on the origin and systematics of genus Homo. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 39–48.")). This interpretation supports the hypothesis that _H. erectus_ descended from _H. habilis_. However, there is a new hypothesis for the biogeographical origins of _H. erectus_ based on the morphological affinities of the Dmanisi fossils: Since the Dmanisi hominins appear to have been the first post-_H. habilis_ hominins to disperse out of East Africa, _H. erectus_ evolved outside of Africa, possibly in western Asia (Rightmire and Lordkipanidze [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR94 "Rightmire GP, Lordkipanidze D.

The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 39–48.")). The early dates in Indonesia could be taken to support this hypothesis and, potentially, so can new _H. erectus_ remains dated to 1.7 million years ago from the Yuanmou Basin in southwest China (Zhu et al. [2008](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR128 "Zhu RX, Potts R, Pan YX, Yao HT, Lu LQ, Zhao X, et al. Early evidence of the genus Homo in East Asia.

### Did Primitive _Homo_ Survive into the Late Pleistocene?

In 2004, Australian and Indonesian researchers, working at the Liang Bua cave on the island of Flores, Indonesia, announced an enigmatic new hominin they called _H. floresiensis_ (Brown et al. [2004](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR21 "Brown P, Sutikna T, Morwood MJ, Soejono RP, Jatmiko, Wayhu, et al. A new small-bodied hominin from the Late Pleistocene of Flores Indonesia. Nature. 2004;431:1055–61."); Morwood et al. [2005](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR83 "Morwood MJ, Brown P, Jatmiko, Sutikna T, Saptona EW, Westaway KE, et al. Further evidence for small-bodied hominins from the Late Pleistocene of Flores Indonesia. Nature. 2005;437:1012–7.")). The new species, which lived between 94 and 17,000 years ago, is represented by the small-bodied skeletal and dental remains of at least nine and as many as 14 individuals, most notably by the well-preserved partial skeleton known as LB1. For the last six years since the discovery, a lively debate has persisted over the remains due to their many surprising traits. Hypotheses that the remains are diseased and are not representative of a new species have circulated in the literature. However, a recent review of all of the current available evidence finds that the Liang Bua hominins are indeed a late-surviving species of early pre-_H. erectus_ (Aiello [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR1 "Aiello LC. Five years of Homo floresiensis. Am J Phys Anthropol. 2010;142:167–79.")).

The strikingly small stature of LB1, reaching only 1.06 meters tall, as a full-grown adult, earned it the nickname of “hobbit” after the small-bodied people in J. R. R. Tolkien’s novels. Not only is LB1 far smaller than all modern adult humans including pygmies, it is similar in size to the famous partial skeleton of the _A. afarensis_ known as “Lucy”—a fossil over three million years older than LB1. What is even more surprising is the cranial capacity of LB1, as the brain is estimated to be only between 385 and 417 cubic centimeters (Falk et al. [2005a](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR38 "Falk D, Hildebolt C, Smith K, Morwood MJ, Sutikna T, Brown P, et al. The brain of LB1, Homo floresiensis. Science. 2005a;308:242–5.")), which is on par with the smallest australopiths.

The tiny brain of the single preserved cranium has led some to suggest that the best explanation for LB1 is that it suffered from microcephaly—a pathologically small brain that can be caused by a number of genetic and developmental abnormalities. However, the brain shape of LB1 (as digitally reconstructed from the endocasts of the cranium), although small, appears to be normal (for some of this debate, see Aiello [2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR1 "Aiello LC. Five years of Homo floresiensis. Am J Phys Anthropol. 2010;142:167–79."); Falk et al.

Response to comment on “The brain of LB1 Homo floresiensis”. Science. 2005b;310:236."); Martin et al. [2006](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR80 "Martin RD, Maclarnon AM, Phillips JL, Dussubieux L, Williams PR, Dobyns WB. Comment on “The brain of LB1 Homo floresiensis”. Science. 2006;312:999.")). Relatively little is known about microcephaly, but based on the skulls and radiographs available for people affected with the condition, the shape of the brain is usually altered from that of normally-developed brains. Other individuals from Liang Bua are small like LB1, but unfortunately, none has a preserved skull to allow brain size estimation.

Despite issues of body and brain size (which have been traditionally important for identifying _Homo_), the discovery team placed the Liang Bua remains in the genus _Homo_. The tooth, jaw, face, and cranial anatomy resemble that of _H. erectus_, and the associated archaeological evidence (like advanced tools and evidence of hunting and fire use) indicates behavioral complexity. To explain the small stature of these hominins, the discoverers offered the following hypothesis: _H. floresiensis_ descended from a population of _H. erectus_ living in Indonesia, and their small bodies are the result of long-term isolation and ecological pressures specific to islands. Island dwarfism is not very well understood, but patterns of animal body sizes around the world reveal that island ecology sometimes influences body size. Small animals sometimes grow large on islands compared to their relatives on the mainland, because predator pressure is relaxed. But large animals tend to get smaller because islands have limited resources. The giant rats of Flores are a good example of the former, and the extinct miniature elephants of Flores probably reflect the latter. _H. floresiensis_ could be a descendant of _H. erectus_ that survived on Flores the same way that elephants did; it got small.

The problem with the insular dwarfing hypothesis is it that it does not quite explain why the Liang Bua hominins do not look like scaled down _H. erectus_. Instead, for example, the carpals, or wrist bones, are primitive and apelike (Tocheri et al. [2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR115 "Tocheri MW, Orr CM, Larson SG, Sutikna T, Jatmiko, Saptomo EW, et al. The primitive wrist of Homo floresiensis and its implications for hominin evolution. Science. 2007;317:1743–5.")), the feet are large (Jungers et al. [2009a](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR60 "Jungers WL, Harcourt-Smith WEH, Wunderlich RE, Tocheri MW, Larson SG, Sutikna T, et al. The foot of Homo floresiensis. Nature. 2009a;459:81–4.")), and the long upper extremities and short legs echo the limb proportions of “Lucy” A.L. 288-1 (Jungers [2009](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR59 "Jungers WL. Interlimb proportions in humans and fossil hominins: variability and scaling. In: Grine F et al., editors. The first humans—origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Berlin: Springer; 2009. p. 93–8."); Jungers et al. [2009b](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12052-010-0247-8#ref-CR61 "Jungers WL, Larson SG, Harcourt-Smith W, Morwood MJ, Sutikna T, Awe Due R, et al. Descriptions of the lower limb skeleton of Homo floresiensis. J Hum Evol. 2009b;57:538–54.")). As researchers continue to perform in-depth analyses of the bones, the results strengthen the other initial hypothesis, which is that the Liang Bua hominins descended from a population that dispersed from Africa prior to the evolution of _H. erectus_.

Summary
-------

The origin of the genus _Homo_ in Africa signals the beginning of the shift from increasingly bipedal apes to primitive, large-brained, stone tool-making, meat-eaters that traveled far and wide. This early part of the human genus is represented by three species: _H. habilis_, _H. rudolfensis_, and _H. erectus. H. habilis_ is known for retaining primitive features that link it to australopiths and for being the first stone tool makers. Little is known about _H. rudolfensis_ except that it had a relatively large brain and large teeth compared to _H. habilis_ and that it overlapped in time and space with other early _Homo_. Our understanding of the paleobiology and evolution of the larger-brained _H. erectus_ is enhanced due to its richer fossil record _. H. erectus_ was the first obligate, fully committed biped, and with a body adapted for modern striding locomotion, it was also the first in the human lineage to disperse outside of Africa. New discoveries controversially hint that the origin of _H. erectus_ may not have been African, as is the prevailing hypothesis, and, furthermore, diminutive and primitive hominins from Flores may be descendants of an even earlier dispersal of _Homo_ than _H. erectus_. In spite of all the questions that remain to be answered about early _Homo_, these hominins are the first to tip the scale from the more apish side of our evolutionary history toward the more human one.
