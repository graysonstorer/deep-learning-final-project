Abstract
--------

This review explores the relation between evolution, ecology, and culture in determining human food preferences. The basic physiology and morphology of _[Homo sapiens](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/homo-sapiens "Learn more about Homo sapiens from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")_ sets boundaries to our [eating habits](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/eating-habit "Learn more about eating habits from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), but within these boundaries human food preferences are remarkably varied, both within and between populations. This does not mean that variation is entirely cultural or learned, because genes and culture may coevolve to determine variation in dietary habits. This [coevolution](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/coevolution "Learn more about coevolution from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") has been well elucidated in some cases, such as lactose tolerance (lactase persistence) in adults, but is less well understood in others, such as in favism in the Mediterranean and other regions. [Genetic variation](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/genetic-divergence "Learn more about Genetic variation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in bitter taste sensitivity has been well documented, and it affects food preferences (eg, avoidance of cruciferous vegetables). The selective advantage of this variation is not clear. In African populations, there is an association between insensitivity to bitter taste and the prevalence of malaria, which suggests that insensitivity may have been selected for in regions in which eating bitter plants would confer some protection against malaria. Another, more general, hypothesis is that variation in bitter taste sensitivity has coevolved with the use of spices in cooking, which, in turn, is thought to be a cultural tradition that reduces the dangers of [microbial contamination](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/microbial-contamination "Learn more about microbial contamination from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of food. Our evolutionary heritage of food preferences and eating habits leaves us mismatched with the food environments we have created, which leads to problems such as obesity and type 2 diabetes.

FOOD PREFERENCES: EVOLUTION, ECOLOGY AND CULTURE
------------------------------------------------

A scientist from another planet, observing human feeding habits, would be struck by 4 things: the remarkable variation in food habits within and between populations, the fact that in many populations food is farmed rather than hunted or gathered, the importance of cultural traditions and ritual in relation to food, and the fact that food is often processed—eg, by cooking or other means—before it is eaten. It is the last of these that is uniquely human. There are other animals that farm food (eg, certain ants), food traditions may be culturally transmitted (eg, the pecking open of milk-bottle tops by birds, which was a phenomenon that spread through Britain in the middle of the 20th century), and other generalist feeders, such as humans, show incredible variation in diet from one place to another. But no other animals cook or manufacture their food.

Given the unusual combination of features of our food lives, it might be tempting conclude that human food preferences are shaped entirely by culture and individual experience. But in this review I discuss how these factors interact with genetics, ecology, and evolution, and in particular how this might give rise to variation within and between populations.

The importance of evolutionary heritage is underlined by our anatomy and physiology. We have inherited from our proto-hominid ancestors the teeth and digestive system of an [omnivore](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/omnivore "Learn more about omnivore from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Carbon isotope analysis of the fossil remains of our early ancestors confirms that they were indeed omnivores. _Australopithecus africanus_, for example, probably had a diet that was ≈75% fruit and leaves but also 25% meat. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that grasses, and the herbivores that feed on them, have more carbon-13 than do leaves or fruit. We know from their teeth that Australopithecines were not adapted to eat grass, so they must have acquired the carbon-13 from meat ([1](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib1), [2](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib2)).

Some anthropologists have also suggested that our ancestors’ feeding habits were not shown only by their teeth and digestive systems but had much wider ramifications. Richard Wrangham controversially proposed, for example, that the discovery of cooking was linked to the extraordinarily rapid evolutionary enlargement of the human [brain](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/protocerebrum "Learn more about brain from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") ([3](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib3), [4](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib4)).

Likewise, our 5 senses of taste—sweet, salt, [umami](https://doi.org/topics/food-science/umami "Learn more about umami from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), bitter, and sour—equipped us for consumption of the essentials for survival—energy, salt, and protein—as well for the avoidance of the dangers of poisonous or rotten food. Of course, food preference is determined by much more than our [senses of taste](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/sensation-of-taste "Learn more about senses of taste from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). The perceived flavor of food often depends as much on scent as on taste, and our expectations can affect the perception of food flavors ([5](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib5)); however, I explore how [genetic variation](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/genetic-divergence "Learn more about genetic variation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in taste may interact with food traditions and ecology.

### Genes, culture, and ecology: lactase persistence

The phenomenon of [lactose intolerance](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/lactose-intolerance "Learn more about lactose intolerance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), or lactase persistence, caused by one or more dominant mutations that arose at the time of the dawn of [agriculture](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/agricultural-science "Learn more about agriculture from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), ≈10,000 y ago, and which affects the production of lactase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down milk sugar, is a well-studied instance of how genes, ecology, and culture interact to determine food preferences ([6](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib6)).

Prior to that time, it is generally thought that humans stopped lactase production after weaning, and therefore lost the ability to digest milk at this point in life. In other words, this was the primitive, or ancestral, state. Lactose is an important component of breast milk, and therefore infants need to be able to digest it, but why should this be lost after weaning? Two arguments have been put forward. One pertains to the economics of metabolism: there is a selective disadvantage in continuing to produce an enzyme, with its associated energy costs, once it is no longer needed. The other argument is that the loss of lactase activity postweaning is an outcome of parent-offspring conflict. Evolutionary theorists have pointed out ([7](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib7)) that parents and offspring may often have divergent interests concerning the amount of investment in an individual offspring. Each offspring values his or her own survival more than that of his or her siblings, whereas parents value each offspring more or less equally. In the simplest case, genes expressed in a mother producing offspring sequentially should favor continued investment in the current one as long as _∂B_&gt _∂C_, where _∂B_ is the marginal benefit from additional investment and _∂C_ the marginal cost to future offspring. However, genes expressed in an offspring would favor additional investment provided that _∂B_&gt _r∂C_, where _r_ is the degree of relatedness between offspring (typically 0.5 in diploid species with sexual reproduction) ([8](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib8)). One possible evolutionary outcome of this conflict over time of weaning would be for selection to favor parents who produce offspring that lose the ability to digest milk.

Derived from this ancestral state of lactose intolerance after weaning, today ≈25% of the human population is unable to digest lactose into adulthood. Models of selection suggest a selective advantage of 3–5% could account for the change in gene frequency over 10,000 y. The selective benefit of lactose tolerance in adulthood probably arose with the birth of [livestock](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/farm-animal "Learn more about livestock from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") farming. Milk was a new, nutritious, and energy-rich source of food, and individuals able to capitalize on this would have been at an advantage. This is indeed reflected in present-day gene frequencies. Lactose tolerance is much commoner in populations with a long history of livestock agriculture than in those with little or only recent history. For example, in northern Europe, ≈95% of adults are able to digest lactose, whereas in some parts of Asia, &lt10% are able to do so ([9](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib9)). Bloom and Sherman ([10](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib10)) extend this analysis further by showing that the distribution of lactose intolerance is also correlated with the historical distribution of communicable diseases of cattle. Hence, the ecology of disease influenced the likelihood of herding being adopted by our ancestors, and this in turn generated a selective force for a change in our digestive system.

Recent genetic evidence indicates that lactase persistence has evolved independently in African and European populations ([10](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib10), [11](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib11)), perhaps associated with the independent development of dairying.

In summary, variation among populations in consumption of milk as adults is a result of an interaction between cultural traditions, genes, and ecology.

### A dynamic polymorphism, driven by disease: favism

Lactose tolerance is one of many examples of the way in which genes, culture, and food preferences coevolve. About 400 million people, especially in Africa, the Mediterranean, and Middle East have a mutation affecting the activity of the red blood cell enzyme [glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase "Learn more about glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (G6DP), which is involved in the oxidative phase of the [pentose phosphate pathway](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/pentose-phosphate-cycle "Learn more about pentose phosphate pathway from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages").

This mutation, analogous to sickle cell anemia, confers an advantage in resistance to malaria because it deprives the _[Plasmodium falciparum](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/plasmodium-falciparum "Learn more about Plasmodium falciparum from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")_ parasite of oxygen in the red blood cells. The mutation is sex-linked and probably maintained by heterozygote advantage in females. But there is a cost to males bearing the mutation (as well as homozygous females) because they are unable to digest one of the staple diet items of the region, [broad beans](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/vicia-faba "Learn more about broad beans from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (a condition known as favism).

The frequency of the mutation that causes favism is correlated with the [geographical distribution](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/geographical-distribution "Learn more about geographical distribution from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of malaria in the Mediterranean and Middle East. This suggests that there is a selective balance between [disease resistance](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/disease-resistance "Learn more about disease resistance from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and food consumption. Intriguingly, some of the traditional herbs and spices used in preparing broad beans in areas of high frequency of favism may actually make the beans easier to digest for those with the mutation ([12](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib12), [13](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib13)).

### Taste sensitivity

We are all familiar with the observation that the same kind of food might taste very different to 2 individuals. In part, this difference is cultural. We are attuned by our individual experience and our social environment to react to some foods as delicious and others as disgusting. But there is also a genetic component to taste preference.

The first discovery of a genetic basis was the accidental finding of Arthur L Fox while working for the Dupont Chemical Company: Fox found that people varied in their response to the bitter chemical phenylthiocarbamide (PTC; subsequently, the same variation in response was found to occur with 6-_n_-propylthiouracil) ([14](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib14)). At the next American Association for the Advancement of Science meeting (in 1931), he and a colleague tested the audience and found that 28% of the audience could not taste PTC, 65% could, and the remainder could not be classified. Subsequently, the tasters were divided into those who are very sensitive, known as supertasters (25% of the population), and those who are sensitive, known as tasters (50% of the population) ([14](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib14)).

This variation is associated with 25 genes and 8 [pseudogenes](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/pseudogene "Learn more about pseudogenes from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") on 3 chromosomes ([15](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib15)). The receptors involved largely respond to plant secondary compounds, ie, compounds manufactured by plants that are poisonous or unpalatable to predators. In other words, the receptors serve to enable us to avoid [toxins in food](https://doi.org/topics/food-science/food-toxin "Learn more about toxins in food from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). Not surprisingly, supertasters tend not to like vegetables, such as [crucifers](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/brassicaceae "Learn more about crucifers from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), that contain bitter secondary compounds. As with any toxin, the risk associated with ingesting [plant toxins](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/phytotoxin "Learn more about plant toxins from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") depends on the dose, and at low doses, plant secondary compounds may have beneficial effects as antioxidants. So there is likely to be a balance of risk and benefit in avoiding toxins. But this leaves open the question of why there is genetic variation between populations in sensitivity to bitter taste. The frequency of nontasters varies among populations, from as low as 7% to &gt40% in populations that have been studied ([13](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib13)). Why should this be?

One intriguing explanation for the variation among populations within Africa ([16](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib16)) is that it is a product of selection for malaria resistance. A low sensitivity to bitter taste was observed in areas with endemic malaria, and it was hypothesized that this is because certain bitter secondary compounds in plants are protective against malaria. In areas with endemic malaria, the protective benefit of consuming potentially dangerous bitter plants could outweigh the risks of poisoning.

### Spices

**A**nother possibility, as yet to be explored, is genetic variation in taste sensitivity between populations linked to the cultural tradition of adding spices to food. Spices are made from plant secondary compounds, and therefore nontasters are less sensitive to strongly spiced food.

But why are spices, which are potentially toxic as well as costly, added to food? Many ideas have been suggested, and it is important to distinguish between those that concern ultimate survival value, and those that refer to the causal, or proximate, mechanisms. For example, the suggestions that “spices make bland food taste better,” “cover up the taste of bad meat,” or “are cultural traditions” refer to proximate mechanisms but beg the question of the survival value of using spices.

Three often-quoted ideas about the evolutionary advantage of using spices are that they contain important [micronutrients](https://doi.org/topics/food-science/micronutrient "Learn more about micronutrients from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), that they are a sign of wealth of the spice owner, or that they have antimicrobial properties. The importance of spices as a sign of wealth is underlined by that fact that Alaric the Goth, who laid siege to Rome in 408 AD, demanded as a ransom various precious metals and 3000 pounds of pepper ([17](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib17)). In medieval England, members of the Peppers’ Guild, founded in 1180, were the custodians of the King’s weights, which reflected the importance of pepper as a barometer of the state of business. In 1373 the pepperers, having joined forces with the spicers, renamed themselves the company of Grossers (or Grocers) (because they were responsible for the heavy weights or peso grosso). The Grossers soon took on responsibility for ensuring the purity of spices sold, a process called _garbling_ (from the Arabic _gharbala_, meaning to sift or select) ([18](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib18)). In many animal species, differences among individual males in mating success are related to differences in the amount of resources they are able to provide for females ([19](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib19)), and spices could be an analog of this.

Spices could have nutritional benefits: for example, they tend to be antioxidants, which are thought to reduce oxidative damage to cells. It has even been suggested that consumption of [turmeric](https://doi.org/topics/food-science/turmeric "Learn more about turmeric from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (cucurmin) might contribute to the low prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease in India ([20](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib20)).

The analysis of spice use in relation to ecology, however, supports the antimicrobial hypothesis. Paul Sherman and his students analyzed the use of spices in the traditional cuisines of 37 countries. The patterns are striking, and fit with our intuition. More spices are used in hotter climates. But this pattern applies only to the spices that inhibit bacterial growth and only in meat dishes ([17](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib17), [21](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib21)). There is no correlation between temperature and the number of spices grown in a country, so the relation between cuisine and temperature is not simply a matter of using what is available. Furthermore, in the United States and China, where there are large variations in temperature, a similar pattern holds.

Sherman concludes that cultural predilections for spicy food have arisen because, through cultural evolution, we have harnessed the natural antimicrobial compounds of plants and incorporated them into our diets. This may go hand in hand with selection for different degrees of taste sensitivity: ecology, genes, and culture woven together to influence our food preferences.

MISMATCH: OUR EVOLUTIONARY PAST COMING HOME TO ROOST
----------------------------------------------------

In the second part of this review, I look briefly at another facet of our evolutionary heritage and food preferences, namely the mismatch between evolved preferences and modern environments.

As many experts have pointed out, some of the major global health epidemics that have emerged in the past few decades are a result of this mismatch. I am going to refer briefly to 2 interrelated “diseases”: obesity and type 2 diabetes (I put disease in quotes, because not all agree that obesity is a disease, although all agree that that there is an obesity epidemic).

Lest we get too pessimistic about these new health risks, let us remind ourselves that in many countries of the world life expectancy has increased dramatically over the past century, as major infectious diseases have been conquered and [nutrition](https://doi.org/topics/food-science/nutrition "Learn more about nutrition from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), sanitation, and other provisions of essentials for health have improved. In the United Kingdom, for example, life expectancy has increased by 60% in the past 100 y. But in the future this trend might well reverse, as a result of so-called lifestyle diseases.

### Obesity

Obesity in the United Kingdom is rising rapidly, as it is in most parts of the world. In fact, the World Health Organization estimates that, globally, ≈1.2 billion people are overweight, of which ≥300 million are obese, a sobering contrast with the estimated 800 million who are undernourished.

Obesity carries with it significantly increased health risks—for example, of cardiovascular disease, some cancers, and type 2 diabetes—and a projected reduction in life expectancy of ≈9 y ([22](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib22)). As a result, most developed countries are wrestling with the problem of how to tackle the obesity epidemic. This is a particularly difficult challenge, both because of the multifactorial causation and because almost any action by government is likely to be seen as interfering with people’s individual lifestyles and therefore labeled as “nanny state” intervention.

From a biological perspective, the puzzle of obesity is to understand why the normal homeostatic control of [body weight](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/body-weight "Learn more about body weight from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") has failed in so many people. A wide range of potential contributing factors, both in terms of energy intake and energy expenditure, have been suggested, although their relative importance is not known. The features of modern living that work against the body’s normal mechanisms for balancing energy intake and expenditure are often summarized by saying that we live in an obesogenic environment, in which our normally adaptive physiology misfires.

One such misfiring relates to [protein intake](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/protein-intake "Learn more about protein intake from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), and hence to the theme of this conference, the umami receptor. The body regulates protein intake, to ≈15% of intake, more tightly than either carbohydrate or fat, so when our diet contains too little protein, we compensate by overconsuming the other 2 macronutrients to keep protein intake constant ([23](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib23)). In recent decades, at least in the United States, where data are available, the average protein content of the diet has declined ([23](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib23)); in association with this, carbohydrate and [fat intake](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/fat-intake "Learn more about fat intake from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") has increased. No one factor accounts for the obesity epidemic, but protein regulation may play a part, and one policy response might be to increase the protein content of processed foods.

### Type 2 diabetes

Just as the prevalence of obesity is rising rapidly, so is the prevalence of type 2 diabetes: it is projected to affect ≈0.5 billion people within a few decades, at great cost both to the individual sufferers and to the health care systems that support them. But just as striking as the overall increase is that type 2 diabetes affects different groups to very different extents, from ≈2% of the population in Europe to ≈50% among Pima Indians of North America ([24](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib24)). Even within groups there are striking contrasts: for example, between rural and urban native peoples in Australia, or within the Pacific Island of Nauru over the past 50 y.

Is this due to differences in genetic makeup or in the environment? The answer is “both.” We know from twin studies, as well as from genome-wide associations, that there is [genetic variation](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/genetic-divergence "Learn more about genetic variation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in susceptibility to the disease. We also know that lifestyle factors such as obesity, lack of exercise, and high [caloric intake](https://doi.org/topics/food-science/caloric-intake "Learn more about caloric intake from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") contribute to the risk ([24](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib24)). Furthermore, in utero effects contribute to risk, including fetal [hyperglycemia](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/hyperglycemia "Learn more about hyperglycemia from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") ([25](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib25)) and low birth weight ([26](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib26)). Barker suggested that poor nutrition during [fetal development](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/fetal-development "Learn more about fetal development from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and in early childhood could affect the development of the pancreas and predispose individuals to type 2 diabetes in later life. There are also epigenetic effects that transmit across generations: in a Swedish study, risk increased if paternal grandparents grew up in times of food abundance ([27](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib27)). But if there is genetic variation in susceptibility to such a debilitating disease, why has selection not eliminated the genes that make us susceptible, and why is there so much apparent variation among populations?

Diamond ([24](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib24)) has suggested that the old idea of “thrifty genes” ([28](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib28)) might be the explanation. The idea is that, in the past, humans were selected to cope with periods of feast and famine. Hence, adaptations that facilitate large appetite and rapid energy uptake would have been an advantage. But these same adaptations misfire, and are therefore selected against, when we are exposed to continuous, plentiful food. The kinds of genetic variation that might be encompassed within the idea of thrifty genes could, for example, include genes affecting sensitivity to insulin or insulin release, as well as genes affecting the mechanisms of appetite control such as leptin release.

Diamond argues that, in Europe, with the advent of more stable food production, these thrifty genes were selected out of the population in a cryptic epidemic (ie, not detected at the time) of type 2 diabetes in the 17th and 18th centuries, whereas populations that have been exposed to famine conditions in more recent times, and now have plentiful food, are undergoing an epidemic of type 2 diabetes with selection against thrifty genes. Recent [single nucleotide polymorphism](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/single-nucleotide-polymorphism "Learn more about single nucleotide polymorphism from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") analysis indicates that genes affecting obesity and diabetes are under strong selection ([29](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib29)) Even if Diamond is correct, this does not rule out other, social, factors, such as stress and low self-esteem, which have been suggested as contributors.

CONCLUSIONS
-----------

In this brief review, I have touched on a few examples to illustrate the ways in which our genetic heritage might affect our food preferences and [eating habits](https://doi.org/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/eating-habit "Learn more about eating habits from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"). In conclusion, I want to make just 2 points. First, although our genetic predispositions may help to explain both our food preferences and our responses to food, as well as variation in these responses, this does not downplay the crucial importance of environmental, developmental, and cultural influences. In most of the examples I have discussed, the outcome depends on a complex interaction between genes and environment. Second, in tackling the major challenge of the links between diet and disease, policy makers should aim to work with, rather than against, our predispositions. I can do no better than quote from Gluckman and Hansen’s ([30](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib30)) book on the concept of mismatch: “the mismatch paradigm, as part of a life course approach to understanding disease causation, can explain and even predict the patterns of disease that are developing rapidly …. It may hold the key to interventions which could pay off.” (Other articles in this supplement to the Journal include references [31.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib31), [32.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib32), [33.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib33), [34.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib34), [35.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib35), [36.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib36), [37.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib37), [38.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib38), [39.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib39), [40.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib40), [41.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib41), [42.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib42), [43.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib43), [44.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib44), [45.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib45), [46.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib46), [47.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib47), [48.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib48), [49.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib49), [50.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib50), [51.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib51), [52.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib52), [53.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib53), [54.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib54), [55.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib55), [56.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib56), [57.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib57), [58.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib58), [59.](https://doi.org/10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462B#bib59).)

2017, Lancet Gastroenterology and Hepatology  Show abstract Studies have shown wide variation in the prevalence of lactose malabsorption across the world, but no systematic reviews or meta-analyses have recently assessed the prevalence of lactose malabsorption in different geographical areas. We aimed to present an updated systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of lactose malabsorption in adults, by countries and regions, and to assess the variation between different testing methods. Studies reporting on prevalence of lactose malabsorption and lactase persistence were identified by searching MEDLINE and Embase from database inception to Nov 2, 2016. We evaluated studies presenting lactose malabsorption or lactase persistence prevalence data in adults and children aged 10 years or older, including cross-sectional and prospective studies, using genotyping, hydrogen breath tests, lactose tolerance tests, and other testing methods. We excluded studies in children younger than 10 years, studies using self-reported data, and studies including inpatients and outpatients at gastroenterological wards. Studies were screened by two authors (CLS and SKF) and data values were extracted by two authors (CLS and SKF) independently. The primary outcome was the prevalence of lactose malabsorption. This study is registered with PROSPERO, number CRD42017064802. We screened 2665 records, and 306 study populations from 116 full-text articles were included (primary sources); data for 144 additional study populations from 59 articles were obtained from review articles, because full-text primary articles could not be obtained (secondary sources). Of the 450 study populations included, 231 were assessed by genotyping, 83 by hydrogen breath tests, 101 by lactose tolerance tests, and 35 by other methods or methods that were not described sufficiently. The studies included 62 910 participants from 89 countries (covering 84% of the world's population). When standardising for country size, the global prevalence estimate of lactose malabsorption was 68% (95% CI 64–72), ranging from 28% (19–37) in western, southern, and northern Europe to 70% (57–83) in the Middle East. When assessing the global prevalence using genotyping data only, the estimate was 74% (69–80), whereas prevalence was 55% (46–65) using lactose tolerance test data, and 57% (46–67) using hydrogen breath test data. Risk of bias was assessed based on ten indicators; 12 of the articles had a score of ten, indicating low risk of bias, 76 had a score of nine, 26 a score of eight, and two articles a score of seven (indicating higher risk of bias). There was substantial heterogeneity between studies within most of the assessed countries. Lactose malabsorption is widespread in most of the world, with wide variation between different regions and an overall frequency of around two-thirds of the world's population. Acknowledging regional patterns of lactose malabsorption is important to guide management of gastrointestinal symptoms. None.

2013, European Journal of Pharmacology  Show abstract Glutamate is one of the most prominent neurotransmitter in the body, present in over 50% of nervous tissue and plays an important role in neuronal excitation. This neuronal excitation is short-lived and is followed by depression. Multiple abnormal triggers such as energy deficiency, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, calcium overload, etc can lead to aberration in neuronal excitation process. Such an aberration, serves as a common pool or bridge between abnormal triggers and deleterious signaling processes with which central neurons cannot cope up, leading to death. Excitotoxicity is the pathological process by which nerve cells are damaged and killed by excessive stimulation by neurotransmitters such as glutamate and similar substances. Such excitotoxic neuronal death has been implicated in spinal cord injury, stroke, traumatic brain injury, hearing loss and in neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer disease, Amyltropic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington disease and alcohol withdrawal. This review mainly emphasizes the triggering events which sustain neuronal excitation, role of calcium, mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS, NO, chloride homeostasis and eicosanoids pathways. Further, a brief introduction about the recent research occurring in the treatment of various neurodegenerative diseases, including a summary of the presumed physiologic mechanisms behind the pharmacology of these disorders.

2009, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition  Show abstract l-Glutamate is one of the most abundant amino acids in alimentary proteins, but its concentration in blood is among the lowest. This is largely because l-glutamate is extensively oxidized in small intestine epithelial cells during its transcellular journey from the lumen to the bloodstream and after its uptake from the bloodstream. This oxidative capacity coincides with a high energy demand of the epithelium, which is in rapid renewal and responsible for the nutrient absorption process. l-Glutamate is a precursor for glutathione and _N_-acetylglutamate in enterocytes. Glutathione is involved in the enterocyte redox state and in the detoxication process. _N_-acetylglutamate is an activator of carbamoylphosphate synthetase 1, which is implicated in l-citrulline production by enterocytes. Furthermore, l-glutamate is a precursor in enterocytes for several other amino acids, including l-alanine, l-aspartate, l-ornithine, and l-proline. Thus, l-glutamate can serve both locally inside enterocytes and through the production of other amino acids in an interorgan metabolic perspective. Intestinal epithelial cell capacity to oxidize l-glutamine and l-glutamate is already high in piglets at birth and during the suckling period. In colonocytes, l-glutamate also serves as a fuel but is provided from the bloodstream. Alimentary and endogenous proteins that escape digestion enter the large intestine and are broken down by colonic bacterial flora, which then release l-glutamate into the lumen. l-Glutamate can then serve in the colon lumen as a precursor for butyrate and acetate in bacteria. l-Glutamate, in addition to fiber and digestion-resistant starch, can thus serve as a luminally derived fuel precursor for colonocytes.    
*   ### [The blood-brain barrier and glutamate](https://doi.org/science/article/pii/S0002916523265119)

2009, American Journal of Clinical Nutrition  Show abstract Glutamate concentrations in plasma are 50–100 _μ_ mol/L; in whole brain, they are 10,000–12,000 _μ_ mol/L but only 0.5–2 _μ_ mol/L in extracellular fluids (ECFs). The low ECF concentrations, which are essential for optimal brain function, are maintained by neurons, astrocytes, and the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Cerebral capillary endothelial cells form the BBB that surrounds the entire central nervous system. Tight junctions connect endothelial cells and separate the BBB into luminal and abluminal domains. Molecules entering or leaving the brain thus must pass 2 membranes, and each membrane has distinct properties. Facilitative carriers exist only in luminal membranes, and Na+-dependent glutamate cotransporters (excitatory amino acid transporters; EAATs) exist exclusively in abluminal membranes. The EAATs are secondary transporters that couple the Na+ gradient between the ECF and the endothelial cell to move glutamate against the existing electrochemical gradient. Thus, the EAATs in the abluminal membrane shift glutamate from the ECF to the endothelial cell where glutamate is free to diffuse into blood on facilitative carriers. This organization does not allow net glutamate entry to the brain; rather, it promotes the removal of glutamate and the maintenance of low glutamate concentrations in the ECF. This explains studies that show that the BBB is impermeable to glutamate, even at high concentrations, except in a few small areas that have fenestrated capillaries (circumventricular organs). Recently, the question of whether the BBB becomes permeable in diabetes has arisen. This issue was tested in rats with diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance or with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. Neither condition produced any detectable effect on BBB glutamate transport.
