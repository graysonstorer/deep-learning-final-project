# DRAW PROCEDURE 

3.  DRAW PROCEDURE 

1.  The four pots representing the teams are labelled team pots 1 to 4. In each team pot, there are eight balls with the country name for each qualified team, including, in team pot 4, two placeholders for the intercontinental play-off winners and the one placeholder for the UEF A play-off slot winner. 2.

# Team Profile 

STATS & FACTS 

• Cameroon have made more appearances at the FIFA World Cup than any other African nation, their qualification for Qatar 

2022 extends their record to eight participations • Since their debut appearance at the 1982 finals, Cameroon have only been absent from three World Cup final tournaments (1986, 2006, 2018) 

• They exited the tournament on their debut in 1982 without 

losing a match following three draws, one of which came against the eventual champions Italy 

• Cameroon’s biggest World Cup achievement is unquestionably their run to the quarter-finals in 1990 where they produced a stunning upset in the opening match of that tournament when they defeated defending champions Argentina 1–0 

• Cameroon have not managed to qualify for the knockout phase since their quarter-final appearance in 1990 and come into this tournament having lost each of their last seven group stage matches, since a 1-0 win against Saudi Arabia in 2002

# Team Profile 

STATS & FACTS 

• Ghana’s appearance at Qatar 2022 means they have qualified for four out of five World Cups since making their final 

tournament debut in 2006 • Ghana made it through to the knockout phase on their debut 

in 2006, and although they were defeated by the defending champions Brazil in the round of 16, they still claimed the achievement of being the only African nation to qualify from the group stage at that edition of the tournament 

• Their best ever performance at the World Cup came in 2010 when they became just the third team from Africa to make it through to the quarter-final stage at the finals 

• Asamoah Gyan became the top African goalscorer in World Cup history when he scored for Ghana at the 2014 finals against Portugal. Overall, the striker scored six goals for his nation at the finals, and found the net at three successive World Cups (2006, 2010, 2014) 

• Remarkably Ghana have faced the USA at each of their previous three World Cups, they won 2-1 in the group stage in 2006, then repeated the feat by the same scoreline in a match which required extra-time in the round of 16 in 2010, the Americans finally gained revenge in the group stage at Brazil 2014 with a 2-1 victory themselves

2010 • Japan looked set to become only the third Asian nation to 

reach the quarter-finals of the World Cup – following Korea DPR (1966) and Korea Republic (2002) – when they led 2-0 against Belgium in the round of 16 at Russia 2018, however, their opponents produced a remarkable turnaround to win 3-2

STATS & FACTS 

• Morocco are making their sixth World Cup appearance this 

time around; they ended a 20-year absence from finals when they featured at Russia 2018 and are now competing at back-to-back editions for the second time in their history. They also achieved this feat in 1994-1998 

• Morocco’s history at the World Cup dates right back to 1970 when they became only the second nation from Africa – after Egypt in 1934 – to feature at the global showpiece tournament 

• The Atlas Lions broke ground at the 1986 finals when they became the first African team to progress beyond the first round, they did so by finishing top of a group which also contained England, Poland and Portugal. Morocco’s tournament ended in the round of 16 when a late goal from Lothar Matthäus gave West Germany a 1-0 victory 

• Morocco have failed to progress further than the group stage in four of their previous five appearances at the FIFA World Cup, the exception being their run to the round of 16 in 1986 

• A 3-1 victory against Portugal in 1986 and a 3-0 triumph against Scotland in 1998 are the only two wins that Morocco have produced in the 16 World Cup matches they have played

# POLAND (UEFA) 

STATS & FACTS 

• Poland have now qualified for the FIFA World Cup on nine occasions (inc. 2022). They ended a 12-year absence from the finals when they featured at Russia 2018 and are now competing at back-to-back editions for the first time since 2002-2006 

• Without doubt the most successful period for Poland in FIFA 

World Cup history was between 1974 and 1986 when they 

made four consecutive appearances at the finals, they notably finished in third place in both 1974 and 1982 

• Poland have not managed to make it further than the group stage in their last three World Cup final tournaments (2002, 2006 and 2018) meaning they have not played a knockout phase match since defeat against Brazil in the round of 

16 in 1986 • None of Poland’s last 12 World Cup matches have finished as a draw, the last one being a 0-0 tie against Morocco in the 

group stage at Mexico 1986 • Despite not winning automatic qualification for FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™, Poland still recorded their best ever tally of goals scored in a FIFA World Cup qualifying group with a total of 30 in just ten games

# PORTUGAL (UEFA) 

STATS & FACTS 

• This will be Portugal’s eighth World Cup appearance and they have been present at each FIFA World Cup final tournament since 2002, meaning they have qualified six times in a row 

• Remarkably, Portugal had only qualified for the World Cup on 

two occasions prior to 2002 and those two appearances came 

20 years apart (1966 and 1986) 

• A third-place finish on their debut appearance at the finals in 1966 remains Portugal’s best ever performance at the FIFA World Cup, though they did come close to matching this feat 40 years later when they finished fourth at the 2006 FIFA World 

Cup in Germany • This is the third time in four World Cups that Portugal have earned their place by progressing via the play-offs, having also qualified via this route for the 2010 and 2014 finals 

• Portugal have scored a total of 49 goals in World Cup history and they look set to reach the landmark of 50 when they compete at the finals in 2022

# Team Profile 

STATS & FACTS 

• Tunisia are participating in their sixth World Cup and second 

in succession having also qualified for the finals in Russia four 

years ago • Tunisia claimed a notable landmark on their debut appearance 

at the finals in 1978 - a 3-1 victory against Mexico in their opening game saw them become the first African team to win a match at a World Cup final tournament 

• Their second victory in the competition did not come until 40 years after their maiden triumph as they defeated Panama 2-1 in their final group match at Russia 2018 to give them a first taste of victory in the tournament since 1978 and end a run of 13 

World Cup matches without a win • The North African nation have not made it through to the knockout phase at the World Cup in their previous five attempts 

• Tunisia have kept only one clean sheet in their 15 World Cup matches. Notably though, the one clean sheet came against West Germany in a 0-0 draw in the group stage in 1978 with 

their opponents being the reigning champions at the time

STATS & FACTS 

• Uruguay were the first nation to win the World Cup having reigned victorious at the inaugural tournament on home soil in 1930 courtesy of a 4-2 victory against Argentina in the final.

editions • This is Uruguay’s 14th World Cup appearance and their fourth in a row since they were last absent from the finals in 2006 

• Remarkably, they were unbeaten in first 11 matches at the World Cup finals with ten wins and a draw before losing in the 1954 semi-finals against Hungary in a match that required extra-time 

• Quarter-finalists in 2018, Uruguay have only failed to qualify for the knockout phase in one of their last six World Cup 

appearances • As well as winning the tournament twice, Uruguay have reached the semi-finals on three further occasions, most 

recently in 2010
