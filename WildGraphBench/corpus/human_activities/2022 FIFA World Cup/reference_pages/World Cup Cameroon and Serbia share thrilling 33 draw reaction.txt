FT: Cameroon 3-3 Serbia This is how the Group G table looks after that game.

A draw keeps Serbia and Cameroon's hopes alive, though Brazil and Switzerland are in the driving seat.

A win for either side in their match later on will seal their place in the knockout stages.

FT: Cameroon 3-3 Serbia Aleksandar Mitrovic has scored seven goals in his last six games for Serbia in all competitions, with the Fulham striker becoming the first player to score more than once at the World Cup for the nation.

Meanwhile, Andrija Zivkovic became the first Serbia player to provide two assists in a single World Cup match, setting up Milinkovic-Savic and Mitrovic's goals against Cameroon.

FT: Cameroon 3-3 Serbia It was all going so well for Serbia, who scored two goals in first-half stoppage-time to lead 2-1 at the break. A brilliant team goal early in the second period then extended their advantage.

I could not see Cameroon getting back into the game at that stage.

Football eh.

FT: Cameroon 3-3 Serbia Cameroon scored three goals in a World Cup match for the very first time, in what was their 25th game in the competition. It was the first time in 16 games they'd even scored more than once at the tournament, since a 2-2 draw with Sweden in 1994.

FT: Cameroon 3-3 Serbia ![Image 16: A 56x56 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/live-experience/cps/96/cpsprodpb/vivo/live/images/2015/8/3/5aaae4e2-8b99-4d7b-a83b-1c9336b3a52f.jpg)  Pat Nevin

Former Scotland winger on BBC Radio 5 Live  Cameroon have to now beat Brazil so do you go 4-2-4? That would be seriously brave because if you had Eric Choupo-Moting and Vincent Aboubakar you could go and launch it. Now that is a big ask but if you are going to go out of the World Cup then go for it although it is not impossible.

Cameroon 3-3 Serbia Was that the game of the tournament? It was definitely up there - thumbs up if you agree!

While you are at it make sure you check out this finish from Vincent Aboubakar for Cameroon's second goal.

Outrageous.

Former Scotland winger on BBC Radio 5 Live  Cameroon got better and stronger as the game went on, you never knew right up until the last few seconds. Vincent Aboubakar must be thinking why didn't you start me but that is because you would have to play 4-2-4 and that is a very open system.

A great contest between two different styles, I wish every game was like this.

FT: Cameroon 3-3 Serbia Both sides can be extremely proud of their performance, though it is the Cameroon players who look the more buoyant. There's plenty of high fives and hugs among the players.

Serbia, in contrast, look a little deflated as they walk over to applaud their supporters.
