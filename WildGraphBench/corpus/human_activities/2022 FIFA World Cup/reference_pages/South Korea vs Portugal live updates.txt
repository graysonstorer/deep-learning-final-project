Party time
----------

It's 2.20am in Seoul, get me on the next plane. One hell of a party over there right now.

A game that was really quite dull for the most part produced some scarcely believable late drama. It just wasn't on the cards. But South Korea have somehow done it.

That's a wrap from us. Thanks for reading.

There's a lot of blubbing going on. From the South Korea players, the fans and the staff. Emotions all over the shop. It's the World Cup that just keeps on giving.

Goalscorer Kim Young-gwon said before the game South Korea needed a miracle today. Well hallelujah brother, I believe!

No huge loss
------------

No huge loss for Portugal today, who still finish top and they importantly managed to rest all their top players either from the start or by subbing them off. Did anyone do enough to force their way into the XI? Dalot, maybe. Tough call between him and Guerreiro. But otherwise the XI looks pretty set I think.

Next round

South Korea's reward for scraping through to the last 16? Almost certainly a game against Brazil. Yeah not the easiest, but one to savour.

As for Portugal, they might play Switzerland, or Serbia, but probably not Cameroon. But yeah we'll know in a few hours. Portugal v Spain is a potential quarter-final now and that's yummy. Ditto a possible match-up of South Korea v Japan if they both win. You wouldn't put it past this World Cup would ya.

It's finished Ghana 0-2 Uruguay! South Korea are through on goals scored!

Hwang tough
-----------

Really pleased for Hwang. He was excellent in his first few games for Wolves, scored four in six at the start of 2021/22, then suffered a hamstring problem and, to be honest, was quite painfully/laughably bad towards the end of the season. To the extent that even his team mates (Daniel Podence and Fabio Silva) were seen laughing at him during a defeat at Liverpool.

He's mostly carried that form into this season. In fact the two main things he's done are miss a penalty against Preston in the EFL Cup and clear the ball straight to Saint-Maximin for Newcastle who scored a stoppage time equaliser.

No wonder he was in tears at full-time today. He's been through the wringer alright. But it's all been worth it right now. Best moment of his entire career.

FULL-TIME South Korea 2-1 Portugal
----------------------------------

Astonishing victory. Sure Portugal rested a few players and subbed a few more off but South Korea just offered barely anything to trouble Diogo Costa in that second half. They looked beaten (well, they were drawing, but you know what I mean). And then from a Portugal corner, Son, the bloke who's been a shadow of his former self lately, and Hwang, the bloke who hasn't scored for Wolves all season and came into the tournament injured, combine to score the most late and dramatic winner. All eyes on Ghana Uruguay now, they've got a few minutes of stoppage time to go......

Asian flags flying high
-----------------------

This has suddenly turned into a brilliant World Cup for the Asian representatives. Japan, South Korea and Australia all through, and Saudi Arabia and Iran also collected victories.

Incredible scenes
-----------------

Incredible scenes at Education City Stadium.

Son really hadn't been enjoying a good game at all, but that's a stunning contribution - not merely the dribble to launch a counter-attack, but the patience to slip the ball in behind for Hwang Hee-Chan.

Pandemonium here.

Brilliant goal
--------------

Just seen a replay of the goal....Hwang was dead level with the defender when Son slipped him in brilliantly after running so far. Fantastic run and pass from the Spurs man, deadly finish from the Wolves man. Genuinely did not see that coming. South Korea have been so subdued. BUT NOT NOW AM I RIGHT

All eyes
--------

All eyes on Ghana Uruguay now. If Uruguay score they're through again. Suarez is almost in tears on the bench there. South Korea through on goals scored as things stand. Amazing this World Cup.

GOAL South Korea 2-1 Portugal
-----------------------------

![Image 15: KOR](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

CAN YOU BELIEVE IT THEY'VE DONE IT!!! Son with the assist and HWANG HEE-CHAN has surely won it in the 91st minute. Honestly they've done NOTHING all night. It's from a Portugal corner, off goes Son, three around him, they're all drawn to him and he slips it through to Hwang, one goal for Wolves ALL CALENDAR YEAR and he beats Costa with a first-time finish. Who's writing this script????!!!

On the charge
-------------

Leao on the charge into the box but he's dealt with. Portugal with the ball in the South Korea third. We're into the 90th minute.

Son corner
----------

Cheerleader Son gets the crowd going yet again before sending over a corner which Portugal deal with. Set pieces feel like the way to go for South Korea. But my goodness they're leaving it late to even put pressure on Portugal, let alone score.

Time running out
----------------

![Image 19: KOR](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

It's not like Portugal are trapped in their own box, throwing themselves at the ball to protect their lead. In fact South Korea are mostly just passing it around their own half of the field and sporadically trying to muster an attack. We're six minutes from stoppage time and South Korea are heading out of the World Cup.

Would have taken it
-------------------

![Image 23: KOR](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

South Korea probably would have taken this when the draw was made? Fifteen minutes left in a very difficult Group H and as things stand they need one goal against a severely weakened Portugal with no Ronaldo, Fernandes, Felix, Dias or Bernardo Silva to go though.

The problem is at the moment they don't look like scoring it. In fact they're devoid of inspiration and Portugal's fresh subs are causing problems.

Leao shot
---------

AC Milan's Rafael Leao, who scored shortly after coming off the bench against Ghana, runs at the South Korea defence before pulling a poor shot wide with his right foot. A sigh of relief for South Korea who are living on a knife edge.

Handball?
---------

Deep cross from the left, Son with a first-time volley...blocked by Cancelo...Son screams for a handball but it's hit Cancelo's ribs. No pen.
