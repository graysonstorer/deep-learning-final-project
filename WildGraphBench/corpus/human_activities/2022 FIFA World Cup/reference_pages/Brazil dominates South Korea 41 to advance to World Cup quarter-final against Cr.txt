After the match, Alisson spoke to Fox about sending well wishes to Pele: "Everybody knows that Pele is not doing well, his health. He means so much for us Brazilians, he means so much for football.

"A small message from our team to him that we are praying for him, for him to get better, that we are together with him, that he's not alone. You'll never walk alone. He will not walk alone at this hard moment, his family will not walk alone.

"We are with them even if we are far away. So if we can fight here at the World Cup and win games for him and win the competition for him, we will do that."

Richarlison: Tite was happy he had the chance to dance
------------------------------------------------------

Richarlison spoke about Brazil's dancing after the win: “We rehearsed that celebration together with the coach, and he was very happy he had the chance to use it.

“Football is like that. One is going to win, the other is going to lose, and I wish all the best to Son. I hope he remains at his best, because I need him at Tottenham.

“I’m also friends with Ivan Perisic, and I hope we’ll both play the next match. I wish the best for him, and hope he remains at his best, so we can play well at Tottenham.”

Bento steps down as South Korea manager
---------------------------------------

Paulo Bento has left his post as South Korea’s manager after their 4-1 defeat by Brazil.

Bento, 53, has been in charge of the South Korea national team since 2018.

He won 35 of his 57 matches in charge, but South Korea suffered a disappointing quarter-final exit at the 2019 Asian Cup and could not upset the odds today.

Following that defeat, Bento said: “I have just announced to the players and the president of the federation that this is a decision I took in September.

“It is set in stone and I have confirmed it. I have to thank everyone for everything they have done.”

He added: “From now onwards we have to think about the future. I’m going to rest and we have to see what will happen after I rest.”

“We have to congratulate Brazil because they were better than us,” Bento added.

Son: 'This is the gap between the players'
------------------------------------------

![Image 7: BRA](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

Son spoke to FS1 following the tough loss. On today's opponent, he said: "Brazil is a favourite and one of the best teams in the world. All of their players are world-class players. We tried to do everything but Brazil deserved to win.

"What can I say? We prepared well and gave everything but this is the gap between the players. But I don’t blame our players because they gave everything and we will move on. Going out of the World Cup is not easy, but yeah."

On Alisson saving his shots, he said: "Yeah, I thought the ball was going in but he made some good saves. He is one of the best goalkeepers in the world.

"If we had scored (in the first half) it would have been different, but they have incredible quality. I wish them all the best."

On South Korea's performance at the tournament, he said: "We are all proud. I am very proud of the achievement of getting out of the group. It’s a big thing for us.

"But as a player you want to move forward. You want to go harder. We want to do better. I don’t know. We will wait four years and we need to prepare well and do better."

Richarlison's red-hot form
--------------------------

![Image 9: BRA](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

On the American broadcast, Fox just had a discussion regarding whether Richarlison is better than Neymar...

I'm not sure I'd go quite that far myself, but the Tottenham forward has scored three times at this tournament, two of them contenders for goal of the tournament.

The 25-year-old has now scored 10 goals in his nine appearances for Brazil in all competitions in 2022, four more goals than any of his team-mates.

Neymar: 'We are confident'
--------------------------

Neymar, speaking through a translator to FS1 after the win, was asked about being one shy of equaling Pele's record of 77 goals for the Brazilian national team: "It's hard to put it into words. I wish Pele the best. He will become healthier very soon, I am sure."

He added: "This is a great victory, a great win. I am very happy with this win. We are excited to have the chance to win the World Cup and we are confident. But we have a lot of hard work left to do."

Brazil still find ways to impress
---------------------------------

![Image 13: BRA](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

Brazil have won the World Cup a record five times, but they still managed to make several bits of history today:

*   This was the earliest they've taken a three-goal lead in a match at the tournament, leading 3-0 after 29 minutes today.
*   Their four goals today not only outnumbered their total of three from the group stage, but it also stands as the most Brazil have scored in a knockout match since a 4-1 win over Chile in 1998.

----------------------------------

Brazil and Croatia have played two competitive matches before, both coming in the World Cup:

*   1-0 win for Brazil in the 2006 group stage, goal courtesy of Kaka. 
*   3-1 win for Brazil in the opening match of the 2014 World Cup, with Neymar scoring twice in Sao Paulo.

A word for Neymar
-----------------

![Image 19: BRA](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

With his goal from the penalty spot in the 13th minute, Neymar became just the third Brazilian to score in at least three editions of the World Cup (2014, 2018, 2022), joining Pele (1958, 1962, 1966, 1970) and Ronaldo (1998, 2002, 2006).

The forward has been involved in 15 goals in his last 11 appearances for Brazil in all competitions (8 goals, 7 assists), though each of his last six goals for the team came from the penalty spot.

**89' Brazil 4-1 South Korea**

Dani Alves tries a volley from inside the Korea box and makes good contact. His effort is tragically blocked, depriving the 39-year-old of quite a moment.
