*   Qatar set an unwanted record in the first game of the 2022 World Cup on Sunday.
*   It become the first host nation in the tournament's history to lose its opening match.
*   Félix Sánchez's side was beaten 2-0 by Ecuador.

Qatar became the first host nation of the World Cup to ever lose its opening game at the tournament as it was beaten 2-0 by Ecuador on Sunday.

Striker Enner Valencia appeared to have opened the scoring after just three minutes in front of a packed crowd at Al Bayt Stadium, however his header was ruled out for an offside in the build-up.

But it didn't take Valencia long to find the net again, this time from the penalty spot in the 16th minute after he was brought down in the box by Qatar keeper Saad Al Sheeb.

Valencia then added his and Ecuador's second with a fine header in the 31st minute to complete the scoring.

"Ever since the draw took place I dreamt about this game,"Valencia, who formerly played in the English Premier League for West Ham United and Everton and whose brace against Qatar saw him become his country's record World Cup goalscorer, told reporters after the match.

"I dreamt about playing in this opening game and winning - so it really is a dream come true. These games are about moments. We were able to score two early goals and it allowed us to take control."

Qatar failed to register a single shot on target in the whole game, with striker Almoez Ali heading wide Qatar's best chance towards the end of the first half.

The disappointing performance prompted a large number of the host nation's fans to leave the stadium at the interval.

"It was won in the first half, a poor second half," said the former England men's striker turned BBC pundit Alan Shearer. "Ecuador managed the game, kept the ball when they had to. It was flat in the second half, even the crowd disappeared after half-time."

The former England women's star Alex Scott added: "The disappointing thing with Qatar was, even when they got some possession, they were so sloppy with it. They gave it away.

"It could be a long group stage for the hosts."

Any hopes of reaching the World Cup knockout phases now look bleak for Qatar.

The host, which is 50th in the FIFA world rankings, the third lowest of any team at the World Cup, next faces reigning Africa Cup of Nations champion, 18th ranked Senegal, on November 25.

It then faces Netherlands, which is ranked eighth, in its final Group A game on November 29.

Fail to make the last-16 and Qatar will become only the second host nation in World Cup history to ever go out at the group stage of the tournament.

The other was South Africa in 2010.
