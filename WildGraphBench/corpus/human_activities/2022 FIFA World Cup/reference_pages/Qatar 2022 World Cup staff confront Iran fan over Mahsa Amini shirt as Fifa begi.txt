============================================================================================

Football fans who attempt to display items with [Mahsa Amini](https://inews.co.uk/opinion/after-the-death-of-mahsa-amini-muslims-across-the-world-are-reminded-they-are-still-not-safe-1868819?ico=in-line_link)‘s name on them face being expelled from World Cup stadiums, with Fifa cracking down on political protest, **i** can reveal.

A shirt with Amini’s name on the back – in support of the 22-year-old who died in custody after being arrested by Iran’s morality police – was confiscated from a supporter at Iran’s win over Wales on Friday.

**i**can also reveal that fans who wore shirts with Amini’s name on the back were refused entry to their country’s opening game against England unless the shirts were turned inside out.

It follows Fifa’s warning to all fans attending the World Cup that any items deemed to be of a political nature will be classed as prohibited. Failure to comply with the rules “may result in expulsion from the stadium”, the guidance warns.

Friday’s incident makes it appear as though security are cracking down on protest items from Iran supporters shedding light on events back home.

One Iran fan at Friday’s game told**i**: “Today, security was very tight. Whoever had [a] ‘Woman, life, freedom’ flag, the security would confiscate [it].”

Neither Fifa nor the Supreme Committee – the Qatari World Cup organisers – would comment on the incident.

Amini’s death sparked waves of protests against the regime in Iran and were mirrored at the World Cup, where thousands of fans have made the journey to Qatar in support of their team in Group B.

Loud jeers whistled around the Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium as Iran’s national anthem played, with thousands of supporters choosing not to take their seats until after kick-off.

One supporter named Yasi, who attended the England vs Iran match earlier in the week and asked **i** not to publish her surname for fear of reprisals, travelled from America to attend the World Cup. She has been wearing striking make-up with dripping tears to games while holding a shirt with Amini’s name on it.

Photographers captured Yasi being confronted by security staff before the game started.

**i**spoke to Yasi [about her protest](https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/brutality-iranian-woman-protest-england-world-cup-opener-1985910?ico=in-line_link). “There are so many brave women and men on the streets just for their basic rights. None of this matters. This game means nothing,” she said. “The people in Iran just want to live, but my people don’t have that. It’s the least I could do.

“All of my family are in Iran. I call them five times a day. If they don’t respond to my texts in five minutes, I get anxious. I call them because you don’t know. Children, people just passing on the street, protestors – there’s so much brutality going on.”

She added: “Fifa cannot tell us to concentrate on the football. Some [free media in Iran had visas to come to Qatar](https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/iran-suppressing-protest-world-cup-censoring-players-banning-journalists-1975756?ico=in-line_link) but at the last minute it was cancelled. That tells you everything.”
