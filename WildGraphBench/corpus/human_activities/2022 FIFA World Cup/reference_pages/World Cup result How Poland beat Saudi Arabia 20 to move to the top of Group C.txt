Robert Lewandowski on his goal
------------------------------

He said: "Let me start from the beginning because I felt so many emotions when I was singing the national anthem. It’s difficult to explain why my emotions were so strong today but I have been dreaming about this since I was a child. And then you think about the importance of the goal. It was just a dream come true. We actually made several good opportunities and I could have scored more but it was a great result. We have another big match to play, of course, and we’ll have to see what the other result is.

"When you play for the national team you have to focus on the result but it’s true that I have always wanted to score in the World Cup. But it’s not easy. We didn’t create many chances in the first half and then I didn’t score the penalty.

"I changed my boots because of the pitch. I just wanted more traction. There’s no big story.

"I think the older I get the more emotional I get. I have always wanted to score at a World Cup just to really underline that I played at a World Cup. I don’t always focus on personal statistics, the team result is the most important thing, but sometimes the two things merge."

Herve Renard's reaction to the game
-----------------------------------

![Image 3: POL](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

The Saudi Arabia manager said: "I’m proud of my team. We were supposed to manage the game better, especially by getting back to 1-1 at half-time. I’m sure it would have changed a lot. But we were not efficient against a strong team. They were a lot of duels and they played some long balls. The key is to to be realistic with your opportunities. But we are still alive and we will keep playing until the last second of our World Cup, we won’t give up.

"When you are a coach, if you are happy after they won the first game, you have to support them when they lose the second.

"We didn’t lose because we were unlucky; we lost today because we were not efficient. Almalki made a mistake for the second goal but I have to support my players. That’s how I’ve managed all my teams. It’s too easy to shout at them when they make mistakes but you have to build them up and support them.

"The most important thing is we are still alive and we’ll play the third game with the same energy. Do you know what we need? The fans. I hope they come in the same numbers. They were superb. I would like to see a green stadium. I think we’ll be wearing white but it doesn’t matter. Green and white is fine. I really hope they support the players again but they deserve it.

"Poland have three fantastic players in their side: Szczesny, Zielinski and Lewandowski. But nobody has just discovered Szczesnhy today. Congratulations to him, he won the game and we didn’t have success against him. But the last game our keeper did the same. This is football.

"I could talk about Robert Lewandowski for an hour. The way he controls the ball, his movement, he’s one of the best strikers in the world."

The earlier goal, in case you missed it (for UK viewers)
--------------------------------------------------------

Zielinski really pounced on that one.

Poland showed their experience
------------------------------

After the high of earlier in the week, Saudi Arabia produced another good display and were the better side for periods.

Poland eventually composed themselves and once they got ahead, controlled and managed the game well.

An important three points for them.

All to play for in this group.

FULL TIME! Saudi Arabia 0-2 Poland
----------------------------------

A really enjoyable game.

Poland have their first win, Lewandowski has his first goal and Wojciech Szczesny has his first World Cup penalty save.

Man of the Match
----------------

A simple choice and it is the Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny who is my man of the match.

It was his incredible double save at the end of the first half, first from the penalty spot and then the follow-up, which kept Poland in the lead.

Two clean sheets and nine saves, the most of any goalkeeper in the tournament is not a bad way to start the competition.

Kan-oh no
---------

A decent long range effort from Kanno curls wide of Szczesny's far post.

Saudi frustrations
------------------

It has not been Saudi Arabia's day but there are positives to take from their performances. They were the better side in the second half and early in the second period but began to run out of steam.

They scored two goals from three shots against Argentina but could not find the net from their fifteen efforts today.

A "horror show"
---------------

Abdulelah Almalki horror show. Poor fella. Shades of Steven Gerrard's clanger against Chelsea about it. Last man, a loose touch, a desperate lunge and then a one-on-one for for the opposition striker. I don't remember Liverpool immediately hooking Gerrard, though. That was Almalki's last touch in this game. And while I type this, Lewandowski has just spurned a one-on-one chance. He surged into the box but went for a dink over the keeper. Good save.

Should be 3-0
-------------

Well it was nearly like London buses with one bringing two for Lewandowski.

He finds himself in behind again and tries to chip the goalkeeper, who dived towards his feet, but Al Owais manages to make the save.

He still only has one goal.

Double Saudi change
-------------------

Renard makes two more changes but this game looks over.

Al Malki, after just committing the mistake which led to Poland's second and Al Shehri are off.

Nasser Al Dawsari and Abdulrahman Al Obud are on in their place.

That goalscoring moment
-----------------------

An emotional Lewandowski finally has his World Cup goal.

GOAL!!!! LEWANDOWSKI HAS DONE IT
--------------------------------

Finally. The curse is over.

Poland double their lead.

It could not have been simpler. Saudi Arabia are playing the ball around the back and a poor touch from Al Malki is pounced on by Lewandowski.

One-on-one with the goalkeeper, he was never going to miss.

Ten minutes to go...
--------------------

It looked like Saudi Arabia were beginning to tire but they've found their second wind in the last few minutes.

They've got ten minutes plus added time to try and find an equaliser.

Inches wide....
---------------

It may just not be Saudi Arabia's day. Lovely run into the box from Abdulhamid. The ball is cut back and there is Abdulelah Al Malki arriving.

He curls his effort towards the far post and is goes just wide.

Off goes Milik
--------------

So close to putting Poland two goals up, Milik is replaced by Krzysztof Piatek.

Within the madness before, Saudi Arabia also made a change. Al Burayk was replaced by Sultan Al Ghannam
