COLLECTED BY

 Organization: [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/webwidecrawl)

 The Internet Archive discovers and captures web pages through many different web crawls. At any given time several distinct crawls are running, some for months, and some every day or longer. View the web archive through the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php). 

Collection: [Wide Crawl started March 2011](https://archive.org/details/wide00002)

Web wide crawl with initial seedlist and crawler configuration from March 2011. This uses the new HQ software for distributed crawling by Kenji Nagahashi.

What?s in the data set:

 Crawl start date: 09 March, 2011

 Crawl end date: 23 December, 2011

 Number of captures: 2,713,676,341

 Number of unique URLs: 2,273,840,159

 Number of hosts: 29,032,069

The seed list for this crawl was a list of Alexa?s top 1 million web sites, retrieved close to the crawl start date. We used Heritrix (3.1.1-SNAPSHOT) crawler software and respected robots.txt directives. The scope of the crawl was not limited except for a few manually excluded sites.

However this was a somewhat experimental crawl for us, as we were using newly minted software to feed URLs to the crawlers, and we know there were some operational issues with it. For example, in many cases we may not have crawled all of the embedded and linked objects in a page since the URLs for these resources were added into queues that quickly grew bigger than the intended size of the crawl (and therefore we never got to them). We also included repeated crawls of some Argentinian government sites, so looking at results by country will be somewhat skewed.

We have made many changes to how we do these wide crawls since this particular example, but we wanted to make the data available ?warts and all? for people to experiment with. We have also done some [further analysis of the content](http://archive.org/~vinay/wide/wide-00002.html).

If you would like access to this set of crawl data, please contact us at info at archive dot org and let us know who you are and what you?re hoping to do with it. We may not be able to say ?yes? to all requests, since we?re just figuring out whether this is a good idea, but everyone will be considered.

Tiny Qatar beats out America for World Cup
==========================================

Despite what was judged to be a superior bid, the United States will not host the 2022 World Cup, which will take place in Qatar.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### BY MICHELLE KAUFMAN

### [mkaufman@MiamiHerald.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20110503195608/mailto:mkaufman@MiamiHerald.com)

The 2022 World Cup will not be coming to the United States, despite a star-studded bid that was deemed by FIFA inspectors to be the most technically and financially sound of all the campaigning nations.

In one of the most shocking upsets in recent soccer memory, Qatar, an oil-rich nation the size of Connecticut, was selected by the FIFA executive committee Thursday to host the 2022 Cup, beating out the United States 14-8 in the final round of voting.

Qatar, with a population of approximately 1.7 million people, becomes the smallest country -- and the first in the Middle East -- to host the world's biggest sporting event. Although the United States promised record-breaking attendance and profits, and hassle-free preparation with all stadiums in place, FIFA opted to make history, reach out to the Muslim world and award the quadrennial tournament to a country whose bid was classified by FIFA inspectors as ``high risk''.

In another surprising vote, the 2018 World Cup was awarded to Russia instead of England, Spain/Portugal and Netherlands/Belgium.

The sport's governing body set aside concerns about Qatar's bid: extreme heat that reaches 120 degrees during the day, lack of existing stadiums and infrastructure and human rights issues. The Qataris plan to spend $4 billion on nine stadiums that will be equipped with state-of-the-art outdoor air-conditioning systems, and another $50 billion on infrastructure.

``Thank you for believing in change, thank you for believing in expanding the game, thank you for giving Qatar a chance,'' said Sheikh Mohammad bin Hamad Al-Thani, the head of the Qatar bid committee. ``We will not let you down. You will be proud of us. You will be proud of the Middle East, I promise you this.''

The profile of soccer has risen in the United States of late, but the U.S. Soccer Federation -- even with the aid of super-schmoozer former President Bill Clinton -- still lacks some clout in the FIFA board rooms. U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati, crushed by the decision, said there was more to the voting than which country had the most impressive bid.

``It's politics, it's friendships and relationships, it's alliances, it's tactics,'' Gulati said on a teleconference. ``There are far too many permutations, especially with two World Cups being decided on the same day, and I am not smart enough to figure out how all those played out in these two elections. It is clear and it has been widely reported over the past several months that there was the possibility of some alliances and the numbers would seem to bear that out.''

Asked whether he thinks the system of awarding the World Cups should change, Gulati added: ``It's obviously not the way certain things are done in the U.S. or in other parts of the world, and it is the way things are done in different parts of the world frankly, and I had some discussions with some of our competitors about that.''

The 1994 Cup, held in the U.S. drew a record 3.6 million fans, and 100 million American television viewers tuned in to the 2010 World Cup. An estimated 5 million would have attended the 2022 tournament.

Miami's Sun Life Stadium was expected to be among the venues had the United States won the bid, and the Miami Beach Convention Center was a likely spot for the World Cup draw.

``It's terribly disappointing to invest that much effort into something and come up empty,'' said Mike Sophia, executive director of the Miami-Dade Sports Commission. ``We all had a sense of momentum, but the last week or so, the reality set in that it's entirely out of our control. It's up to 22 people and what they think is best for FIFA, and that is hard to swallow.''
