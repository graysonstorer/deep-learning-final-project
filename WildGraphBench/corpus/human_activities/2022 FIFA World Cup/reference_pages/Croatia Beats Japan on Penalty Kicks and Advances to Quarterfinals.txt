AL WAKRAH, Qatar — Japan’s players gathered together in the center circle, waiting for the bell to chime. Few teams had done more to give some shape to the inchoate days of this World Cup than the Japanese. They had, in the space of a week and a half, beaten Germany and Spain and, in between, lost to Costa Rica. They had turned the group phase, that supposed formality, into chaos, pure and uncut.

When the end came, though, it brought with it not a breath of that uncertainty, that irrepressible hope. A constrained, reticent meeting with Croatia ended in stalemate. Extra time came and went — in an almost literal sense — without incident. Even a penalty shootout, a concept designed for the purpose of providing a rousing crescendo, did not produce a heart-stopping twist, a final thrill.

Instead, Takumi Minamino and Kaoru Mitoma tamely, almost apologetically, missed Japan’s first two efforts, both of which were saved comfortably by Dominik Livakovic, handing Croatia an advantage that would take some considerable effort to squander.

What followed was so routine as to feel somehow administrative: Mario Pasalic, the Croatia midfielder, walked from the halfway line to the penalty area. He picked up the ball. He put it down. He took a couple of steps backward. He clipped a shot past Shuichi Gonda. He ended Japan’s tournament. He did it all with the businesslike air of a man checking a box on some paperwork, making sure everything was in order before it was filed.

As Croatia’s players celebrated in the corner, Japan’s sank to their haunches. A few had tears in their eyes. They had, in one sense, achieved far more at this tournament than they might have expected. The draw for the group phase, after all, had been unusually cruel. Few had given Japan much of a chance of escaping a pool that included two former World Cup winners, even if one of them was an increasingly accident-prone Germany.

That it had done so made Qatar 2022 the country’s most successful men’s tournament before the round of 16 even started; the fullback Yuto Nagatomo had already declared this side the “strongest in Japanese history at the World Cup.” Japan had been competing in World Cup finals for 24 years and had never claimed a scalp quite as grand as that of the Germans. It would, as it turned out, be the biggest result in its history for about 10 days, until Spain.

For all that the Japanese achieved, though, the abiding feeling that will accompany Coach Hajime Moriyasu and his players as they return from Qatar will be regret. Japan has never made a World Cup quarterfinal. And as unkind as its group phase draw had been, the knockout bracket had worked in Japan’s favor. This was its chance. It may not get a better one.

Croatia, certainly, is no Spain. It may not, in fact, be much of a cut above Germany. It is only four years since Luka Modric, Ivan Perisic and the rest made the World Cup final, of course — the smallest nation, by some distance, to do so in the modern age — but its powers have considerably dwindled.

The temptation, of course, is to zoom in on Modric, to point out that time is starting to catch up with one of the finest midfielders of his generation, but that is not the problem. Yes, Modric is 37 now. Yes, his powers have started to show the first, telltale hints of waning. No, he cannot quite complete a full 90 minutes, not four times in two weeks.

But he remains, identifiably and undeniably, Luka Modric. He is still a vision of poise and elegance and has surprising reserves of energy. He can still spend a good hour bursting forward from his post in midfield, just as he did when he was 27, only dropping deeper once he felt that Croatia needed less impulse and more control.

It is the same with Perisic, still a grizzled old warrior, chugging up and down the left wing, and with Marcelo Brozovic, patrolling behind Modric. They all wear their age lightly. They might be slightly faded, but they are hardly worn. The brightest lights of a golden generation do not just stop shining.

No, the issue is what is around them. Four years ago, Modric could rely on the guile of Ivan Rakitic alongside him in midfield and the pugnacious pragmatism of Mario Mandzukic up front. They are absent from the field now, though, along with six more of the side that faced France in the 2018 final in Moscow.

Their replacements — the likes of Bruno Petkovic and Ante Budimir — are not bad players, not at all. Croatia’s resources remain drawn largely from Europe’s elite leagues, and in Josko Gvardiol, the central defender, the country may even have found another generation-defining talent.

But the precise mix, the one that brought so much success for so long, has been diluted, altered in some ineffable way. It is not that time has caught up with Modric — he has said he wishes to play until he is 40, and it is hard to build a convincing case against that idea — but that he has outlasted much of the rest of his generation.

For a while, it seemed as if Japan would take advantage. It more than merited its lead at halftime, secured thanks to a goal from Daizen Maeda. Every time the Japanese attacked at pace, every time they flickered with even the slightest purpose, Croatia seemed to rock back on its heels.

It was saved, if anything, by first a muscle memory — a long, hopeful ball from one old-timer, Dejan Lovren, met with a thunderous header by another, Perisic — and then a trait which distills, rather than evaporates, with time: sheer, bloody-minded grit.

Slowly, surely, Croatia squeezed all of the fun out of Japan. Unlike Spain, unlike Germany, it was not prepared to tolerate any chaos. This was business, not pleasure. There was no time for drama, no space for twists. There was nothing, in fact, but a box to be checked and some paperwork to be filed.

FINAL: A veteran-laden Croatia team outlasted Japan on Monday and advanced to the World Cup quarterfinal, 3-1 on penalties after a 1-1 draw.

Daizen Maeda put Japan ahead late in the first half with a poached goal after a little flicked pass by Maya Yoshida.

But Croatia equalized in the second half after a long cross by Dejan Lovren landed precisely on the head of Ivan Perisic, who hammered it home.

After a scoreless extra time, the game went to penalties, and Dominik Livakovic came up big, making three saves and sending Croatia to the next round, where it will face the winner of Brazil-South Korea.

114′ A throw-in directly to the head of Croatia’s Livaja is saved. Rapidly, at the other end, a headed cross by Mitoma also winds up in the keeper’s hands. This has penalty kicks written all over it.

105′ A speeding Mitoma races 50 yards and unleashes a rocket that is saved. The best chance of extra time so far goes to Japan.

99′ The teams are, frankly, running out of gas and ideas. If there is to be a goal, it is now likely to come after a mistake rather than a moment of offensive brilliance. The legend Modric is subbed out. Is this his final appearance at a World Cup? His teammates will determine that.

91′ The teams have kicked off in extra time, with a minimum of 30 minutes more to play. Japan made four subs in regulation, but Croatia made just two, which may give it a few more fresh weapons to use as players inevitably tire.

Reporting from Qatar

Croatia looks a shadow of the team that made the final four years ago: There are flashes of the old magic, but the lack of attacking talent is stark. Luka Modric, Marcelo Brozovic and Mateo Kovacic are as good a midfield as there is in the tournament, but ahead of them (the tireless and apparently ageless Perisic apart) there is no pace, no urgency, not even any real grit.

[Here’s How Extra Time Works at the World Cup](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/12/05/sports/japan-croatia-world-cup-score#world-cup-extra-time-tie)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tie games are inevitable at the World Cup, especially in the later stages when the stakes rise and the sinews stretch.

But in the knockout stages, every game must produce a winner. That means if a game is tied after 90 minutes, it will go to extra time. Here’s how it works.

After a short break, the teams will play two 15-minute extra periods, including any minutes of added time the officials deem necessary. There is no sudden death: Both periods are played to their conclusion, regardless of how many goals are scored (or not).

If the teams are still tied after extra time, they go to a penalty kick shootout.

In that, a coin flip decides which side goes first. The teams then pick five penalty takers, and they alternate attempts until a winner is determined. That can take as few as three rounds of attempts — if, for example one team converts its first three and its opponent misses all three — or as many as … well … as many as it takes.

That can [sometimes take a while](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zncr3RaZ6k&ab_channel=Concacaf), and the longer it goes, the more fun it gets.

Except for the people involved.

After the full 90, it’s Japan 1, Croatia 1. For the first time at this World Cup, we will play extra time. How tired will the normally tireless Japan team be after all that running?

75′ The skillful Lovren-Perisic goal notwithstanding, Croatia has been wasteful in front of goal, with headers going wide and shots going over. With 15 minutes of normal time to go, this game is still refreshingly yellow and red card free.

Japan took a 1-0 lead on Croatia at halftime as it tried to make the quarterfinals of a World Cup for the first time. Ritsu Doan earned a start after two goals in the group stage and it paid off as his cross from near the corner flag caused havoc in the Croatia box. After a missed header, Maya Yoshida flicked the loose ball to Daizen Maeda, who poked it into the net. The goal stood up after a review.

Both teams had chances in the game, but Croatia could not find a finishing touch: Josko Gvardiol kicked a good chance into row Z, and Bruno Petkovic was foiled in the box after dawdling for one second too many.
