Dear President, Dear Executive Committee members, 

The FIFA Evaluation Group for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup™ bids is pleased to present its evaluation of the bids to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups™. In all, nine bids, including two joint bids, were submitted. Please fi nd in the following the evaluations of the bids, together with an explanation of the fact-fi nding process. FIFA’s bidding process is based on the principles of transparency and equality, and the Bidding Countries received rules as well as guidance from FIFA in order to ensure comprehensive and speci fi c documentation of their candidature. We greatly appreciated the warm welcome and the cooperation we received from the Bidding Committees and the people in each of the 

Scope 

As part of the bidding process, FIFA requested each Bidder to provide information on infrastructure, legal conditions, operational and legacy concepts for the organisation of a FIFA World Cup™. This Bid Evaluation Report evaluates the information provided in the Bidding Documents, indicates the extent to which the requirements have been ful fi lled, and identi fi es potential gaps and risks in respect of FIFA’s requirements for hosting a FIFA World Cup™. The report is based on an unbiased assessment, taking into account FIFA’s experience of hosting and staging previous editions of the FIFA World Cup™, the information, proposals and statements provided by the Bidder and the information gathered during the on-site inspection tour by means of sample assessment of the venues and facilities. Nine bidders have been evaluated based on the Bidding Documents submitted and the inspection visits, which were undertaken with the aim of clarifying and verifying speci fi c areas of infrastructure. 11 countries during the bidding process, and especially their determination to ful fi l all of our requirements. I would also like to express my gratitude to all the members of the Evaluation Group for their dedication, energy, expertise and friendship during the time that we have spent together over the past six months. These words of thanks also extend to the FIFA staff members who have played a major part in bringing this project to a successful conclusion. We feel we have accomplished our work in the spirit of integrity, objectiveness and transparency.

Nine of the 12 stadiums already exist and would be renovated, and three would be built. A stadium construction and renovation budget of approximately USD 2.29 billion has been projected. In terms of football development, the bid’s proposals would make a contribution towards establishing football as one of the top sports in Australia and Oceania. Australian football is gaining respect worldwide, and its teams have recently recorded various successes at club and international level. Australia has experience of hosting major international sports events in the last 20 years, having hosted the 2000 Summer Olympic Games in Sydney and the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. 

# 4.1 Australia: Executive Summary 

The Australia bid’s hosting concept highlights the opportunity for FIFA to bring the FIFA World Cup™ to Australia and the Oceania region for the fi rst time. The bid is supported by the national and local football authorities, the local city governments (by virtue of duly executed Host City Agreements), the stadium authorities (by virtue of duly executed Stadium Agreements) and the national government (by virtue of duly executed Government Guarantees). The Bidder has contracted the required number of venue-speci fi c training sites (VSTs) but has not contracted the required number of venue-speci fi c team hotels (VSTHs). It has contracted the required number of TBCs training sites but has not contracted the required number of TBC hotels. Otherwise, FIFA’s requirements for team facilities are likely to be met. In terms of accommodation, 43,000 rooms have already been contracted, thus falling short of FIFA’s minimum requirement of 60,000. That said, Australia would have suf fi  cient good-quality hotel capacity to host the competition and accommodate the majority of FIFA’s constituent groups under fair and contractually guaranteed conditions. As for the FIFA headquarters, it appears that the proposals ful fi l FIFA’s requirements. Australia has a well-developed transport infrastructure and considerable experience in managing the traf fi c and crowd fl ows generated by sports events. However, the country’s vastness and geographic location imply a dependence on air travel, potentially causing domestic and international transfer challenges in view of the lack of alternative means of long-distance transport within the country. The country has a strong information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure, and it appears that FIFA’s requirements would be met. International standards for major event safety and security and for health and medical services are likely to be met.

The Bidder has submitted its concepts for sustainable social and human development and environmental protection initiatives. The Bidder has also submitted its proposals for the competition-related event venues. Marketing, media and communication matters have also been addressed. The information provided in the Bid Book suggests that Australia has an established market for major event sponsorship and a developing market for football sponsorship. The existing regulations in Australia which adversely affect the free and unrestricted exploitation of media rights need to be suspended in accordance with the undertakings given in Government Guarantee No. 6 (Protection and Exploitation of Commercial Rights). Should the FIFA World Cup™ be hosted in Australia, there is a risk of a reduction in TV income and, as a result, commercial revenue from Europe and the Americas. The income from Asia/Oceania would need to be increased substantially to offset the likelihood of loss of revenue in Europe. The Bidder has submitted an expenditure budget of USD 535.2 million (current) for a FIFA Confederations Cup and FIFA World Cup™ in 2021 and 2022. The budget has been submitted in the format required with highly detailed supporting information. A projection of approximately 3,020,000 sellable tickets has been made. If Australia is awarded the hosting rights, FIFA’s legal risk appears to be low. All contractual document requirements have been met and the necessary government support has been secured. The Government Guarantees and the Government Declaration have been provided in compliance with FIFA's requirements, but remain subject to additional legislative steps which the government has undertaken to conduct within the required deadline subject to parliamentary sovereignty. However, the Australian Government has experience in supporting the hosting and staging of major sports events and has proven its willingness to make material concessions and accommodate the concerns of event organisers.

A stadium construction and renovation budget of USD 2.54 billion has been projected. In terms of football development, the Bid Book puts forth a range of initiatives targeted at England and other parts of the world. Focus areas include school sport, physical education and grassroots football. English football is respected worldwide and its teams have recorded various successes at club and international level. England has experience of hosting large-scale international events in the last 20 years, including the UEFA EURO 1996 and the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. In addition, England will host the upcoming 2012 Summer Olympic Games and the 2015 IRB Rugby World Cup. England was also the host country of the 1966 FIFA World Cup™. 

# 4.2 England: Executive Summary 

The England bid’s legacy is based on the establishment of “Football United”, a global fund associated with the FIFA World Cup™ and aimed at driving positive global social change and development. The bid’s hosting concept proposes two FIFA Fan Fest™ sites per candidate Host City, with one site speci fi cally tailored to families. The bid is supported by the national and local football authorities, the local city governments (by virtue of duly executed Host City Agreements), the stadium authorities (by virtue of duly executed Stadium Agreements) and the national government (by virtue of duly executed Government Guarantees). The bid proposes 12 candidate Host Cities and 17 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA’s minimum requirement. Five of the 17 stadiums already exist and would be renovated, fi ve are to be built The Bidder has not contracted the required number of venue-speci fi c training sites (VSTS) or venue-speci fi c team hotels (VSTH). The Bidder has contracted the required number of team base camp (TBC) training sites but has not contracted the required number of TBC hotels. Additional training sites, likely to be selected from England’s existing range of professional club stadiums and training sites, may have to be considered. The proposed TBC renovations would have to be ensured, and some pairings should be reviewed. In terms of accommodation, the Bidder proposes a relatively large inventory. However, the fact that not many of the rooms have been contracted in full compliance with FIFA’s template Hotel Agreement requires further analysis and potentially renegotiation. FIFA could be exposed to excessive pricing and booking conditions and the constituent groups may choose not to use the relevant properties. The Bidder has submitted a suitable proposal for the FIFA headquarters pending the contracting of additional hotel rooms. Although England does not have an extensive high-speed rail network, it has a high level of domestic and international accessibility, with an extensive rail and road network and two major international airports in London Heathrow and Manchester.

It appears that the country’s IT infrastructure would meet FIFA’s IT requirements. International standards for major event safety and security and for health and medical services are likely to be met. The Bidder has submitted concepts for initiatives pertaining to sustainable social and human development and environmental protection. The Bidder has also submitted suitable proposals for competition-related event venues in seven cities. Marketing, media and communication matters have also been addressed. The information provided in the Bid Book suggests that England is the leading football sponsorship market in the world and one of the biggest markets for major sports event sponsorship in the world. In terms of TV rights, the current listed-event regulations in the United Kingdom, which adversely affects the free and unrestricted exploitation of media rights, needs to be suspended in accordance with the undertakings given in Government Guarantee No. 6(Protection and Exploitation of Commercial Rights). Should the FIFA World Cup™ be hosted in Europe, the TV ratings in Europe and the European media rights income are likely to be secured. The Bidder has submitted an expenditure budget of USD 722.9 million (current) for a FIFA Confederations Cup and FIFA World Cup™ in 2017 and 2018. The budget has been submitted in the format required with supporting information. A projection of approximately 3,397,000 sellable tickets has been made. If England is awarded the hosting rights, FIFA’s legal risk appears to be low. The requirements for contractual documents have been met and the necessary government support has been secured with the exception of the reservations and quali fi  cations to four Government Guarantees as contained in the Government Legal Statement, the U.K. Government has been given the opportunity to gain experience in supporting the hosting and staging of major sports events and to show its willingness to make material concessions and accommodate the concerns of event organisers.

< 1m 1 to 5m > 5m 16 17 Executive summaries Executive summaries It should be noted that a co-hosting concept could pose challenges regarding the joint operational delivery of the FIFA World Cup™ in terms of ensuring consistent standards and implementation in various areas such as legal, IT, frequencies, safety and security. Therefore, in order to provide a more complete basis for evaluation of the co-hosting concept, further key operational details would be required, especially in view of the administrative, logistical and fi nancial challenges of co-hosting a FIFA World Cup™. The joint bid proposes 12 Host Cities and 14 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA’s minimum requirement. Six of the 14 stadiums already exist and would be renovated, seven would be built, and one is ready for use. A stadium construction and renovation budget of approximately USD 2.43 billion has been projected. 

# 4.3 Holland & Belgium: Executive Summary 

The Holland & Belgium bid’s co-hosting concept highlights the opportunity to bring countries and people together through sport and addresses environmental matters. The bid is supported by the national and local football authorities, the local city governments (by virtue of duly executed Host City Agreements) and the stadium authorities (by virtue of duly executed Stadium Agreements). In terms of football development, the Bidder has submitted a plan to establish a “WorldCoaches” programme which ties in with the Football for Hope movement. Through the initiative, over 6,042 coaches would be trained and ten specialised academies would be established worldwide by 2018. In addition, other development activities are covered, such as the building of “Open Football Clubs”. Both Belgium and the Netherlands have recorded various successes at club and international level. They also have experience of hosting a major international football event in the last 20 years, having co-hosted UEFA EURO 2000. The Bidder has not contracted the required number of venue-speci fi c training sites (VSTS) or venue-speci fi  c team hotels (VSTH). It has also not contracted the required number of team base camp (TBC) training sites. FIFA’s team facility requirements could potentially be met, but the information provided was not suf fi  ciently complete to enable a full evaluation. In terms of accommodation, 28,000 rooms have already been contracted, thus falling short of FIFA’s minimum requirement of 60,000. Accordingly, there is a risk of excessive prices and non-negotiable conditions. However, some gaps in accommodation could potentially be compensated through the central geographic location of Belgium and the Netherlands and their ef fi cient transportation systems. As for the FIFA headquarters, it should be noted that the proposed hotels are not situated in the candidate Host Cities for the opening match and fi nal. Furthermore, the rate for a standard room in both proposed hotels is high and should be reviewed. The Netherlands and Belgium have well-developed transport infrastructures, with extensive road and rail networks and access to international airports at home and in neighbouring countries. The traf fi c-reduction measures proposed are essential to increase capacity and facilitate event transport operations during peak times.

The countries also have strong information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructures, and it appears as though FIFA’s requirements would be met. International standards for major event safety and security and for health and medical services are likely to be met. The Bidder has submitted its concepts for sustainable social and human development and environmental protection initiatives. The Bidder has also submitted its proposals for the competition-related event venues. Marketing, media and communication matters have also been addressed. The information provided in the Bid Book suggests that the major event and football sponsorship market in Belgium and the Netherlands is developed. However, the Government Guarantee No. 6 (Protection and Exploitation of Commercial Rights) submitted by both countries contains no guarantees, undertakings or con fi rmations with legal effect beyond existing laws, and important aspects are superseded by Government Guarantee No. 8 (Legal Issues and Indemni fi cation). On this basis, FIFA’s rights protection programme cannot be ensured in either country. Belgium’s listed-event legislation adversely affects the free exploitation of media rights in Belgium and would have to be reviewed. Should the FIFA World Cup™ be hosted in Europe, the TV ratings in Europe and the European media rights income are likely to be secured. The Bidder has submitted expenditure budgets of USD 541.6 million (current) for a FIFA Confederations Cup and FIFA World Cup™ in 2017 and 2018 and USD 552.8 million (current) for the same events in 2021 and 2022. The budgets have been submitted in the format required with limited supporting information. A projection of approximately 3,304,000 sellable tickets has been made. If Holland & Belgium are awarded the hosting rights, FIFA’s legal risk appears to be medium. Whilst the requirements for contractual documents have been largely met, the necessary government support has not been secured as neither the Government Guarantees nor the Government Declaration have been provided in compliance with FIFA’s requirements for government documents. Nevertheless, the governments of both countries have experience in supporting the hosting and staging of a major sports event and have proven their willingness to make material concessions and accommodate the concerns of event organisers.

< 1m 1 to 5m > 5m 20 21 Executive summaries Executive summaries The bid proposes 11 Host Cities and 13 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA’s minimum requirement of 12 stadiums. Of the 13 stadiums proposed, 12 already exist and would be renovated, and one would be newly built. A stadium construction and renovation budget of USD 700-1,300 million has been projected. Eight stadiums ful fi lled FIFA’s previous requirements, as con fi  rmed by their use for the 2002 FIFA World Cup™. However, if Japan is awarded the hosting rights for the 2022 FIFA World Cup™, speci fi  c attention would have to be given to the ful fi lment of future FIFA World Cup™ space and quality requirements. 

# 4.4 Japan: Executive Summary 

The Japan bid’s hosting concept consists of fi ve main aspects: new football content utilising audio, video and information technologies; a new high-technology stadium experience; global fan fests; innovative internet business; and educational activities. The bid is supported by the national and local football authorities, the local city governments (by virtue of duly executed Host City Agreements) and the stadium authorities (by virtue of duly executed Stadium Agreements). In terms of football development, the bid seeks to build on existing activities in Japan and Asia, and plans to leverage and commercialise several elements of its hosting concept, e.g. global fan fests and internet business, to generate revenue for further development activities. The Japan Football Association (JFA) and the J-League are highly respected worldwide, and its teams have recorded various successes at club and international level. Japan has experience in hosting international football events in the last 20 years, having co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup™ and the FIFA Confederations Cup 2001 and hosted several FIFA Club World Cups successfully. The Bidder has contracted the required number of venue-speci fi c team hotels (VSTH) but has not contracted the required number of venue-speci fi c training sites (VSTS). It has contracted the required number of team base camp (TBC) hotels and training sites. The Bidder appears to understand the requirements well, but there is a limited supply of contracted and suitable facilities in some locations. In terms of accommodation, 96,000 rooms have already been contracted, thus exceeding FIFA’s minimum requirement of 60,000. Overall, the bid offers a wide-ranging and plentiful supply of rooms under fair, contractually agreed conditions. As for the FIFA headquarters, the total number of contracted rooms in the proposed hotels does not meet the requirement of 700 rooms. Additional information is required about the of fi ce space concept.

Japan has an excellent transport infrastructure, comprising numerous international and national airports and extensive road and rail networks. However, traf fi c-reduction measures are essential to increase capacity and facilitate event transport operations during peak times. Likewise, the country has a strong information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure, and it appears as though FIFA’s requirements would be met. International standards for major event safety and security and for health and medical services are likely to be met. However, the implementation of the safety and security concept is not fully ensured as not all of the conditions of Government Guarantee No. 4 (Safety and Security) have been met. The Bidder has submitted its concepts for sustainable social and human development and environmental protection initiatives. The Bidder has also submitted suitable proposals for the competition-related events. Marketing, media and communication matters have been addressed. The information provided in the Bid Book suggests that the major event and football sponsorship market in Japan is well established and developed. However, as the required guarantees, undertakings and con fi rmations were not given as part of Government Guarantee No. 6 (Protection and Exploitation of Commercial Rights), FIFA’s overall commercial programme cannot be ensured. Should the FIFA World Cup™ be hosted in Japan, there is a risk of a reduction in TV income and, as a result, commercial revenue from Europe. The income from Asia/Oceania would need to be increased substantially to offset the likelihood of loss of revenue in Europe. The Bidder has submitted an expenditure budget of USD 843.4 million (current) for a FIFA Confederations Cup and FIFA World Cup™ in 2021 and 2022. The budget has been submitted in the format required without supporting information. A projection of approximately 3,280,000 sellable tickets has been made. If Japan is awarded the hosting rights, FIFA's legal risk appears to be medium. Whilst the necessary government support has not been secured as neither the Government Guarantees nor the Government Declaration have been provided in compliance with FIFA's requirements for government documents, the Japanese Government has experience in supporting the hosting and staging of a major sports event and has proven its willingness to make material concessions, accommodate the concerns of event organisers, and has expressed its intention to enact the necessary Government Guarantees and legislation (without accepting a deadline). Furthermore, the requirements for contractual documents have been met.

Of the 14 stadiums proposed, 13 already exist and would be renovated, and one would be built for the 2014 Asian Games. A stadium construction and renovation budget of USD 877 million has been projected. Ten stadiums ful fi lled FIFA’s previous requirements, as con fi  rmed by their use for the 2002 FIFA World Cup™. However, if Korea Republic is awarded the hosting rights for the 2022 FIFA World Cup™, speci fi  c attention would have to be given to the ful fi lment of future FIFA World Cup™ space and quality requirements. 

# 4.5 Korea Republic: Executive Summary 

The Korea Republic bid’s hosting concept presents the idea of holding some matches of the 2022 FIFA World Cup™ in Korea DPR. The bid is supported by the national and local football authorities, the local city governments (by virtue of duly executed Host City Agreements), the stadium authorities (by virtue of duly executed Stadium Agreements) and the national government (by virtue of duly executed Government Guarantees). In terms of football development, Korea Republic plans to concentrate mainly on national development and speci fi c activities in Asia. Korea Republic football is respected worldwide and its teams have recorded various successes at club and international level. The country also has experience in hosting international football events in the last 20 years, having co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup™ and the FIFA Confederations Cup 2001, and having hosted the FIFA U-17 World Cup 2007. Korea Republic will also host the 2014 Asian Games, which will give it further experience of organising large-scale, international sports events. The Bidder has contracted the required number of venue-speci fi c training sites (VSTS) and the required number of venue-speci fi c team hotels (VSTH). It has contracted the required number of team base camp (TBC) training sites but has not contracted the required number of TBC hotels. Upgrades to many training sites may be required to ensure FIFA World Cup™ standards. In terms of accommodation, 87,000 rooms have already been contracted, thus exceeding FIFA’s minimum requirement of 60,000. However, the majority of FIFA’s constituent target groups would be accommodated in two or three-star quality standard rooms. The Bidder has submitted a suitable proposal for the FIFA headquarters.

Korea Republic has plans to enhance its well-developed transport infrastructure. The proposed traf fi c-reduction measures are essential to increase capacity and facilitate event transport operations during peak times. The country has a strong information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure, and it appears as though FIFA’s requirements would be met. International standards for major event safety and security and for health and medical services are likely to be met. The Bidder has submitted its concepts for sustainable social and human development and environmental protection initiatives. The Bidder has also submitted its proposals for the competition-related event venues, although these require some adjustments. Marketing, media and communication matters have also been addressed. The information provided in the Bid Book suggests that the major event and football sponsorship market in Korea Republic is well developed. In terms of TV, the current broadcasting law, which adversely affects the free and unrestricted exploitation of media rights, needs to be suspended in accordance with the undertakings given in Government Guarantee No. 6(Protection and Exploitation of Commercial Rights). Should the FIFA World Cup™ be hosted in Korea Republic, there is a risk of a reduction in TV income from Europe. The income from Asia/Oceania would need to be increased substantially to offset the likelihood of loss of revenue in Europe. The Bidder has submitted an expenditure budget of USD 496.6 million (current) for a FIFA Confederations Cup and FIFA World Cup™ in 2021 and 2022. The budget has been submitted in the format required with limited supporting information. A projection of approximately 3,000,000 sellable tickets has been made. If Korea Republic is awarded the hosting rights, FIFA's legal risk appears to be low. All requirements for contractual documents have been met and the necessary government support has been secured. Furthermore, the Korean Government has experience in supporting the hosting and staging of a major sports event and has proven its willingness to make material concessions and accommodate the concerns of event organisers.

Qatari football is still developing and its youth teams have recorded some successes at international level. In terms of experience in hosting international sports events in the last 20 years, Qatar has already hosted the 1995 FIFA U-20 World Cup as well as the 2006 Asian Games. In January 2011, the country will host the 2011 AFC Asian Cup. The relatively short distances between all facilities related to teams, such as stadiums and team base camps, suggest that the traditional venue-speci fi c team hotel (VSTH) and venue-speci fi c training site (VSTS) approach may not be needed. The bid proposes both this traditional approach as well as an innovative team base camp (TBC) village approach which relies on several critical assumptions for success: the positive reception of the TBC village concept by teams, the effectiveness and acceptance of cooling systems for all training sites, and high-quality grass growth under proposed sun shades. Furthermore, many of the proposed 

# 4.6 Qatar: Executive Summary 

The Qatar bid’s hosting concept, which is in line with Qatar’s national development strategy, presents a novel approach to event operations and legacy. The Qatar bid envisions a concentration of almost all key event facilities and venues in a relatively compact area within a radius of 60 kilometres. In terms of legacy, there is a strong commitment to having a carbon-neutral FIFA World Cup™, especially through utilisation of environmentally friendly cooling technologies. After the event, modular sections from the stadiums are planned to be used to construct 22 stadiums around the world in developing countries. The opportunity for FIFA to bring the FIFA World Cup™ to the Middle East for the fi rst time is also highlighted. The bid is supported by the national and local football authorities, the local city governments (by virtue of duly executed Host City Agreements), the stadium authorities (by virtue of duly executed Stadium Agreements), and the national government (by virtue of duly executed Government Guarantees). The bid proposes seven Host Cities and 12 stadiums, thus meeting FIFA’s minimum requirement for the event. Three of the 12 stadiums would be renovated, and nine would be constructed. The signi fi cant construction work involved merits consideration, especially in terms of stadium readiness, testing under conditions comparable to the FIFA World Cup™ and the deployment of climate-control measures (as proposed by the Bidder) in FIFA World Cup™-sized stadiums. A stadium construction and renovation budget of approximately USD 3 billion has been projected. In terms of football development, the Bidder has outlined its domestic and international programmes. The construction of the 22 modular stadiums abroad after the event as team facilities have still to be constructed. While all of the proposed team facilities are contracted, a number of points require further consideration and need to be addressed on a revised contractual basis. The proposed TBC village concept may change the approach to the FIFA World Cup™ as a nationwide event. In terms of accommodation, over 84,000 rooms have already been contracted, thus exceeding FIFA’s minimum requirement of 60,000. That said, the accommodation plan heavily depends not only on the capacities of two candidate Host Cities but also on signi fi cant construction. The fi nal number of accomplished projects would determine the number of supporters who could be accommodated. Furthermore, the concentration of the majority of rooms in just a few properties could lead to the risk that the exclusivity of certain constituent groups could not be ensured. As for the FIFA headquarters, the proposal appears to meet all of FIFA’s requirements. The transport plan, in line with the hosting concept, differs from transport models of past FIFA World Cups™ due to the fact that all key venues are situated in close proximity to one another. Signi fi cant development is planned for both the New Doha International Airport and the general transport infrastructure. Nevertheless, the fact that ten out of the 12 stadiums are located within a 25-30km radius could represent an operational and logistical challenge. Any delay in the completion of the transport projects could impact FIFA’s tournament operations. Moreover, it appears to be dif fi cult to test a transport concept prior to the event under conditions comparable to the FIFA World Cup™. The fact that New Doha International Airport would be the primary air gateway for the entire tournament period also requires careful consideration. Based on the information in the Bid Book, it appears as though FIFA’s information and communications technology (ICT) requirements would be met.

In terms of safety and security, the Qatar bid considers its compact hosting concept as advantageous. A concept would have to be established to enable adequate testing of the proposed security model prior to the event under conditions comparable to the FIFA World Cup™. International standards for health and medical services are likely to be met. However, the fact that the competition is planned in June/July, the two hottest months of the year in this region, has to be considered as a potential health risk for players, of fi cials, the FIFA family and spectators, and requires precautions to be taken. The Bidder has submitted its concepts for sustainable social and human development and environmental protection initiatives. The Bidder has also submitted a suitable proposal for a single competition-related event venue, the Doha Convention Centre, which is under construction. A detailed concept remains to be developed in order to address how all event operations for the hosting of 64 matches as well as event-related services such as transport and accommodation would be ensured in terms of sourcing, recruitment and logistical support of suf fi ciently quali fi ed staff. Marketing, media and communication matters have also been addressed. The information provided in the Bid Book suggests that the major event and football sponsorship market in Qatar has potential for growth. Because Qatar has a time zone of UTC+3, there is unlikely to be a negative impact on TV ratings in Europe and the European media rights income should the FIFA World Cup™ be hosted in Qatar. The Bidder has submitted an expenditure budget of USD 645.5 million (current) for a FIFA Confederations Cup and FIFA World Cup™ in 2021 and 2022. The budget has been submitted in the format required with supporting information. A projection of approximately 2,869,000 sellable tickets has been made. However, the forecast merits review due to the impact of the construction schedule and modular seating on ticketing operations. The Bidder’s plan implies a new operational model for all stakeholder groups and in doing so raises certain questions, especially in terms of logistics and security. The realisation of the plan depends on centralised decision-making and is largely based on construction of projected general and event infrastructure, which represents a risk by restricting FIFA’s contingency planning. If Qatar is awarded the hosting rights, FIFA's legal risk appears to be low. All requirements for contractual documents have been met, but additional speci fi c undertakings and securities are necessary given the special situation in, and the special hosting concept of, Qatar. The necessary government support has been secured.

< 1m 1 to 5m > 5m 32 33 Executive summaries Executive summaries In terms of football development, the Bidder outlines various programmes to increase participation in the game across Russia and its adjoining countries. Russian football is respected worldwide and its teams have recorded various successes at club and international level. Russia has experience in hosting a major international sports event in the last 20 years, having hosted the FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup 2006. It will also host the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Sochi (one of the candidate FIFA World Cup™ Host Cities). The Bidder has contracted the required number of venue-speci fi c team hotels (VSTHs) and venue-speci fi  c training sites (VSTSs). It has contracted more than the required number of team base camp (TBC) hotels and training sites. Realisation of the team facility plan depends on signi fi  cant construction in general as well as upgrades to training sites. Privacy may also be an issue for some sites with regard to closed training sessions. 

# 4.7 Russia: Executive Summary 

The Russia bid’s hosting concept proposes to maximise exposure to Russia for visitors and facilitate participation in the FIFA World Cup™ for as many Russian regions as possible through a geographic clustering of the candidate Host Cities. The bid is supported by the national and local football authorities, the local city governments (by virtue of duly executed Host City Agreements), the stadium authorities (by virtue of duly executed Stadium Agreements), and the national government (by virtue of duly executed Government Guarantees). The bid proposes 13 Host Cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA’s minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be constructed. A stadium construction and renovation budget of USD 3.82 billion has been projected. In terms of accommodation, more than 100,000 rooms have already been contracted, thus exceeding FIFA’s minimum requirement of 60,000. Based on the information in the Bid Book, Russia has an adequate supply of contracted rooms, largely in the three-star category, in every candidate Host City. However, the signi fi cant investment forecast indicates a dependence on construction and modernisation within the hotel sector. As for the FIFA headquarters, the proposal appears to meet FIFA’s requirements although the rack rate for a standard room in the proposed hotel is high and should be reviewed. The bid’s transport plan is based mainly on the geographic clustering of its candidate Host Cities. The country’s vastness and its remoteness from other countries, coupled with the fact that the high-speed railway network is limited and would only link six candidate Host Cities by 2018, would put pressure on the air traf fi c infrastructure, potentially causing transfer challenges in view of the lack of alternative means of long-distance transport. The current air traf fi c situation is to be improved through major upgrades and capacity increases to the majority of the airports. However, any delay in the completion of the transport projects could impact on FIFA’s tournament operations and the proposed installation of temporary facilities could impose a high cost burden. In particular, a greater number of direct fl ight connections to major international airports would have to be made available from the majority of candidate Host City airports.

The information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure in some areas of the country would have to be upgraded to bring it up to the standard needed to support the FIFA World Cup™. International standards for major event safety and security and for health and medical services are likely to be met. The Bidder has submitted its concepts for sustainable social and human development and environmental protection initiatives. The Bidder has also submitted generally suitable proposals for the competition-related event venues located in three candidate Host Cities. Marketing, media and communication matters have also been addressed. The information provided in the Bid Book suggests that the major event and football sponsorship market in Russia is growing and not yet fully developed. In terms of TV, even in the case of matches in Russia’s European time zones (Moscow and Saint Petersburg are UTC+4), there might be an impact on European ratings, although this would most likely be limited. Russia might offer some time zone advantages for the Asian markets, but the effect of these advantages would also be limited and might impact the Americas. The Bidder has submitted an expenditure budget of USD 641.3 million (current) for a FIFA Confederations Cup and FIFA World Cup™ in 2017 and 2018. The budget has been submitted in the format required with supporting information. A projection of approximately 3,141,000 sellable tickets has been made. If Russia is awarded the hosting rights, FIFA’s legal risk appears to be low. The requirements for contractual documents have been met, and the necessary government support has been secured and is con fi  rmed by the Government Legal Statement. Furthermore, the Russian Government has been given the chance to gain experience in supporting the hosting and staging of a major sports events and to show its willingness to make material concessions and accommodate the concerns of event organisers.

Host City Non-Host City < 1m 1 to 5m > 5m 36 37 Executive summaries Executive summaries It should be noted that a co-hosting concept could pose challenges regarding the joint operational delivery of the FIFA World Cup™ in terms of ensuring consistent standards and implementation in various areas such as legal, IT, frequencies, safety and security. Therefore, in order to provide a more complete basis for evaluation of the co-hosting concept, further key operational details would be required, especially in view of the administrative, logistical and fi nancial challenges of co-hosting a FIFA World Cup™. The joint bid proposes 18 Host Cities and 21 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA’s minimum requirement. Nine of the 21 stadiums would be renovated, fi  ve would be constructed, and seven are built with no further renovation indicated. A stadium construction and renovation budget of almost USD 2 billion has been projected. 

# 4.8 Spain & Portugal: Executive Summary 

The Spain & Portugal bid’s co-hosting concept presents the advantages of co-hosting by referring to the shared history and football culture of the two countries. The joint bid is supported by the national and local football authorities, the local city governments (by virtue of duly executed Host City Agreements), the stadium authorities (by virtue of duly executed Stadium Agreements), and the national governments (by virtue of duly executed Government Guarantees). In terms of football development, the joint bid presents many ideas which could form the basis for further development programmes. Spanish and Portuguese football is respected worldwide and its teams have recorded various successes at club and international level. In terms of their experience of hosting major international sports events in the last 20 years, Spain hosted the 1992 Summer Olympic Games in Barcelona, while Portugal hosted UEFA EURO 2004. Spain was also the host country of the 1982 FIFA World Cup™. The Bidder has contracted the required number of venue-speci fi c team hotels (VSTHs) but has not contracted the required number of venue-speci fi c training sites (VSTSs). It has contracted the required number of team base camp (TBC) hotels and training sites. FIFA’s team facility requirements could potentially be met, although a complete inventory of contracted training sites is required. In terms of accommodation, 85,000 rooms have already been contracted, thus exceeding FIFA’s minimum requirement of 60,000. However, it should be noted that this fi gure includes up to 15,000 rooms contracted well outside the candidate Host Cities and that 40% of the 85,000 contracted rooms are concentrated in two cities, Barcelona and Madrid. The Bidder has submitted a suitable proposal for the FIFA headquarters. In terms of transport, Spain and Portugal can count on three main international airports (Madrid, Barcelona and Lisbon) spread across the peninsula, as well as the AVE train network, which is planned to be one of the most highly developed high-speed train networks in the world upon its completion in 2012. In some cases, however, city transport infrastructure requires attention.

Regarding information and communications technology (ICT), insuf fi cient details are provided in the Bid Book to allow proper evaluation of the overall solution. Based on the Bid Book, a clear operational concept has not been speci fi ed for safety and security, however international standards for major events are likely to be met. International standards for health and medical services are also likely to be met. The Bidder has submitted its concepts for sustainable social and human development and environmental protection initiatives. Regarding the competition-related event venues submitted by the Bidder, some operational areas such as accommodation and transport require further clari fi cation. Marketing, media and communication matters have also been addressed. The information provided in the Bid Book suggests that the sport and football sponsorship markets in Spain and Portugal are developed. In terms of TV rights, should the FIFA World Cup™ be hosted in Europe, the TV ratings in Europe and the European media rights income are likely to be secured. The Bidder has submitted an expenditure budget of USD 675.6 million (current) for a FIFA Confederations Cup and FIFA World Cup™ in either 2017 and 2018 or 2021 and 2022. The budget format deviates slightly from the format required and limited supporting information has been provided. A projection of approximately 3,674,000 sellable tickets has been made. If Spain & Portugal are awarded the hosting rights, FIFA’s legal risk appears to be low. The requirements for contractual documents have been met. The necessary government support has been secured with minor steps to be taken to ensure full compliance with the FIFA requirements. The Portuguese Government has recent experience in supporting the hosting and staging of a major sports event and has proven its willingness to make material concessions and accommodate the concerns of event organisers.

All 18 stadiums are built with no further renovation indicated. Nevertheless, since most stadiums are American football venues, the Bidder plans to remove seats in the corners and adapt the existing structure to meet the FIFA World Cup™ pitch size requirements. In terms of football development, the Bidder suggests a range of domestic and international activities that could be funded by the success of the FIFA World Cup™ in the USA. United States (US) football is respected worldwide and its teams have recorded various successes at club and international level. The USA has considerable experience in hosting large-scale national and international sporting events in the last 20 years. It held the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, the 1994 FIFA World Cup™ and the FIFA Women’s World Cups™ in 1999 and 2003. 

# 4.9 USA: Executive Summary 

The USA bid’s hosting concept and legacy programme highlights the importance of the FIFA World Cup™ as a key step in the further development of the USA as a football nation. The bid offers fl exibility in terms of city infrastructure, stadiums and facilities, all of which provide a broad platform for staging the event. The bid is supported by the national and local football authorities, the local city governments (by virtue of duly executed Host City Agreements) and the stadium authorities (by virtue of duly executed Stadium Agreements). The Bidder has contracted the required number of venue-speci fi c team hotels (VSTH) but has not contracted the required number of venue-speci fi c training sites (VSTS). It has contracted the required number of team base camp (TBC) hotels but has not contracted the required number of TBC training sites. FIFA’s team facility requirements could potentially be met, however a complete inventory of contracted team facilities is required. In terms of accommodation, 170,000 rooms have already been contracted, thus exceeding FIFA’s minimum requirement of 60,000. The accommodation plan is based on a wide-ranging and plentiful supply of good-quality rooms at fair, contractually agreed conditions. As for the FIFA headquarters, it is proposed to have separate FIFA headquarters for the 

fi rst and second stages of the competition. Additional details are required in order to assess the proposals. The rate for a standard room in the proposed fi rst-stage hotel is high and should be reviewed. In general, the candidate Host Cities have a well-developed transport infrastructure and experience in managing traf fi c and crowd fl ows for events and sports contests. However, the country’s vastness and geographic location imply a dependence on air travel in view of the lack of alternative means of long-distance transport within the country. Nevertheless, the capacity of the airports and the competitiveness of the aviation market in the USA would assure reliable air transfer. Temporary transport would have to be arranged to and from the majority of the proposed stadiums during the event. The country has a strong information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure, and it appears as though FIFA’s requirements would be met. International standards for major event safety and security and for health and medical services are likely to be met.

The Bidder has submitted its concepts for sustainable social and human development and environmental protection initiatives. The proposals submitted by the Bidder for the competition-related events would generally ful fi l FIFA’s requirements. Marketing, media and communication matters have also been addressed. The information provided suggests that the USA is the number one market for sports sponsorship in the world and that it also has a growing market for football sponsorship. However, as the required guarantees, undertakings and con fi rmations are not given as part of Government Guarantee No. 6 (Protection and Exploitation of Commercial Rights) and mere reference is made to existing general intellectual property laws in the USA, FIFA’s rights protection programme cannot be ensured. In terms of TV, should the FIFA World Cup™ be hosted in the USA, the TV ratings and media rights income in the Americas are likely to be higher. The Bidder has submitted an expenditure budget of USD 661.2 million (current) for a FIFA Confederations Cup and FIFA World Cup™ in 2021 and 2022. The budget has been submitted in the format required with supporting information. A projection of approximately 4,957,000 sellable tickets has been made. If the USA is awarded the hosting rights, FIFA's legal risk appears to be medium. Whilst the necessary government support has not been documented as neither the Government Guarantees, the Government Declaration nor the Government Legal Statement have been provided in compliance with FIFA's requirements for government documents, the US Government has considerable experience in supporting the hosting and staging of major sports events and has proven its willingness to make material concessions, accommodate the concerns of event organisers, and has expressed its intention to enact the necessary legislation by 1 June 2013. Furthermore, the requirements for contractual documents have been met.
