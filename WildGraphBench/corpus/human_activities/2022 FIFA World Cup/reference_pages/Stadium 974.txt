First Match

##### Mexico v Poland: 22 November (7 PM)

##### A big win for innovation and sustainability

Stadium 974 made history even before its first match. Constructed entirely from shipping containers and modular steel, it is the first fully demountable covered football stadium – showing Qatar’s commitment to cost-effective sustainability and daring design.

This unique venue pays tribute to Qatar’s long-standing tradition of worldwide trade and seafaring. Not only is 974 the international dialling code for Qatar, but it is also the exact number of shipping containers used in construction. Situated in the portside area and in sight of Doha’s coastal cityscape, fans at Stadium 974 will feel the cool breeze as it rolls in from the Arabian Gulf.

After the tournament, the containers and super-structure will be reused. A waterfront development boasting fabulous facilities for the local community will spring to life, as well as a dynamic hub for business. This new concept in venue development ensures that while Stadium 974’s physical presence may be temporary, its legacy will be everlasting.
