Wales 0-3 England Now the match is done and dusted, thanks to the thousands of you who have messaged BBC Sport to say former Wales defender Danny Gabbidon, who has been commentating on BBC One tonight, sounds exactly like Michelin-starred chef Tom Kerridge.

Once you hear it, you can't unhear it.

Wales 0-3 England England top the group thanks to a superb second-half display in which Mancunian pair Rashford and Foden did the damage.

Senegal await in the last 16.

Wales' first World Cup in 64 years ends in disappointing fashion.

Wales' most-capped footballer on BBC Radio Wales  I feel disappointed with this campaign, with all the games for different reasons.

You talk about where does this group of players go now. I feel it's about more than Bale and Ramsey.

It's about who we are, how we want to play, where we want to go. Rob Page has to figure out who we are again in those three months before we play again.

Wales 0-3 England Like a hot knife through butter. Jack Grealish and Phil Foden combine to fashion a shot for the latter in the box but it is blocked.

That will be that.

Former Wales striker on BBC Radio Wales  It's a half-volley five yards out. John Stones will feel he should have scored.

Wales 0-3 England Oh, should be 4-0!

The corner is floated to the back post and Harry Maguire heads it back into the six-yard box. John Stones has all the space and time he needs to finish, but somehow prods his effort over.

Former Wales striker on BBC Radio Wales  It's a great ball from Ethan Ampadu for Kieffer Moore. You would like to see more of that, wouldn't you?
