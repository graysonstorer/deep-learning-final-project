Substitutions can make or break games for teams and those stakes don't get any higher than at a World Cup.

With entire nations watching on, bringing on the right players at the right time can be the difference between success and failure.

LATEST VIDEOS

In the 2014 World Cup final, it was Germany substitute Mario Gotze that scored the decisive goal in extra time against Argentina.

Managers have yield even more responsibility at the 2022 World Cup after FIFA opted to change the number of substitutions allowed for Qatar due to COVID and the congested schedule.

How many substitutes at World Cup 2022?
---------------------------------------

FIFA have confirmed teams will be permitted to make up to **five substitutions per game** at the 2022 World Cup.

Previous World Cups only permitted three substitutions so the change for the Qatar tournament is quite significant.

The increase was passed by FIFA due to the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 and the unique timing of this World Cup.

While five substitutions can be made, managers will only have three windows to make them during the 90 minutes but this doesn't include half-time breaks.

How many substitutes in extra time?
-----------------------------------

Should a 2022 World Cup match go to extra time, each team will be permitted **one additional substitution**.

So if a team had used all five in normal time, they will be allowed to make a sixth sub in extra time.

That means that for the first time ever, more than half a starting side could be substituted during a World Cup game.

In extra time, substitutions can take on even greater significance, as fresh legs potentially give a team an advantage to try and sneak a crucial goal.

That was certainly the case in that 2014 World Cup final, when Gotze came off the bench against Argentina to net the strike that won Germany a fourth world title.

How many players allowed on the bench at the World Cup?
-------------------------------------------------------

With more substitutions allowed, benches have also been increased for the 2022 World Cup.

A total of 15 players can be listed as substitutes, for each team, for each match - an increase on the previous 12 that could be listed.

Benches can consist of no more than 26 people with 11 spots reserved for team officials.

How many substitutes are allowed around the world?
--------------------------------------------------

Following the COVID-19 outbreak, many leagues around the world decided to increase permitted substitutions from three to five.

The Premier League was among those, but temporarily reverted back to three before a club vote saw the five-substitution rule return for the 2022/23 season.

Major League Soccer has also stuck with five substitutions with a further two available for players with suspected concussion under a trial system.

In June 2022,the International Football Association Board (IFAB) decided to formally write the use of five substitutions into the Laws of the Game but stressed it's implementation was down to respective governing bodies.
