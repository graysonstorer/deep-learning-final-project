This year is **a World Cup year with a difference**. The month-long tournament has traditionally taken place after the domestic leagues in Europe have been completed, usually **between June and July**. But the **2022 edition will be taking place in Qatar** - the first time the event will be staged in the **Middle East**. However in Qatar, the **average maximum daytime temperature in July is around 42°C** - that’s too hot to play football or even watch it, so organisers FIFA decided to move the competition from its traditional date to later in the calendar year.

The **2022 World Cup** will get underway with the**inaugural match** between hosts **Qatar**and **Ecuador**on **Sunday 20 November** and run through to the climax, the final itself on **Sunday 18 December**. That means it will have a direct impact on all of the major **European leagues** and also **UEFA’s three club competitions** - the **Champions League**, **Europa League** and **Conference League**. All of the South American leagues will have concluded by early November so fortunately, they won’t be affected.

### **Changes to the Champions League group stage calendar**

**November**and **December**, are generally key months in the **Champions League**as it is precisely **when the group stage is decided**. Every year, FIFA usually has an eight or nine-day window in mid-November for **international fixtures** - which causes a break in the Champions League group stage**after Matchday 4**. In other words, with the final two rounds of group games, Matchdays 5 and 6, left to play. This year, **Matchdays 5 and 6 have been brought forward**which means that the group stage will be completed **before the World Cup kicks off** in Qatar. The **draw for the Round of 16** stage will also be held earlier - on **7 November**.

The dates below show how the **2022/23 Champions League** will accommodate the **Qatar World Cup**:

#### **Champions League group stage**

**Matchday 1**: 6/7 September

**Matchday 2**: 13/14 September

**Matchday 3**: 4/5 October

**Matchday 4**: 11/12 October

**Matchday 5**: 25/26 October

**Matchday 6**: 1/2 November

**2022/23 Champions League Round of 16 draw:**Monday 7 November

#### **FIFA 2022 World Cup Qatar**

**Inaugural match: Qatar vs Ecuador**- Sunday 20 November

**Final:**Sunday 18 December

The latter stages of the **Champions League** won’t be affected - the tournament will resume in the New Year with the **Round of 16** to be played on **14/15/21/22 February** and **7/8/14/15 March 2023**.

#### Champions League Group Stage draw
