Fans attending the [2022 World Cup](https://www.foxnews.com/category/sports/soccer/the-world-cup) in Qatar may be subject to a special zone to sober up if they become to intoxicated, organizers confirmed.

Nasser Al Khater, [Qatar's World Cup](https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/middle-east) chief, cited safety when he spoke about the implementation of the designated areas.

"There are plans in place for people to sober up if they've been drinking excessively," Al Khater, who is chief executive of the supreme committee. "It's a place to make sure that they keep themselves safe, they're not harmful to anybody else," Al Khater told Sky News.

[FIFA and World Cup](https://www.foxnews.com/sports/world-cup-2022-visitors-required-show-proof-negative-covid-19-test-regardless-vaccination-status) officials previously reached an agreement that allows fans to buy beer during matches. However, the agreement stated only licensed hotel restaurants and bars would be allowed to sell alcohol.

[Public intoxication](https://www.foxnews.com/category/food-drink/drinks) is not particularly prevalent in Qatar. The designated areas are being presented as an alternative to wide scale arrests of fans throughout the World Cup.

Any fan who is sent to the "sobering up" zone will have to stay there until they display clearheaded behavior, according to ESPN. However, fans' release will also come with a warning.
