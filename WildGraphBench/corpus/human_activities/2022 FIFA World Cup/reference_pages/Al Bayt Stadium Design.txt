Al Bayt Stadium – host venue for the opening match of the FIFA World Cup 2022™ – is a striking sight for any football fan or traveller.

Inspired by the _bayt al sha'ar_ of nomadic people, who have etched a living from Qatar's deserts for millennia. The magnificent tent structure envelopes an ultra-modern football stadium, welcoming visitors into comfort as has been the tradition in this part of the world for centuries.

### **Tradition & modernity in harmony**

Traditionally, the tents of nomadic tribes and families in Qatar could be identified by black stripes like those on the arena's distinctive exterior, and by the vibrant _sadu_ patterns that will greet fans once inside the stadium. Visitors to Qatar get a taste of traditional design from the region, while local fans are reminded of their proud heritage.

Even football fans who have never set foot in Qatar will benefit from this venue's forward-thinking design. Its modular construction will mean that the upper tier of seats (almost half of the 60,000 capacity) can be removed after the FIFA World Cup 2022™ and donated to developing nations across the world.

### **Designed with the future in mind**

As well as being incredibly eye-catching, the tent design is deeply practical. The shade provided by the tent structure and its retractable roof system complement the stadium's cooling technologies, helping maintain a comfortable temperature inside without using any extra power.

Sustainability has also driven the design of the area around Al Bayt Stadium. Parks and greenery form an integral part of the surrounding precinct's design plan, creating a green lung for Al Khor and providing local families with invaluable outdoor space to enjoy.

This commitment to environmental preservation is shared by every company working with the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy on this venue. It began with[Dar Al-Handasah](http://www.dargroup.com/#Dar), which served as the design consultant, while[Projacs](http://www.projacs.com/Home)were responsible for project management in the initial phase.

Qatari contractor[Galfar Al Misnad](http://galfarqatar.com.qa/), in conjunction with Italian contractors[Salini Impregilo Group](http://www.salini-impregilo.com/en/)and[Cimolai](http://www.cimolai.com/index.php?lang=en), constructed the stadium and the energy centre building. Landscaping and underground utility works, meanwhile, were carried out by Qatari contractors[Bin Omran Trading and Contracting](https://www.botc.com.qa/)and[Al Sulaiteen Agricultural & Industrial Complex](http://saic.com.qa/saic/). Overall construction supervision was covered by[KEO International Consultants](http://www.keoic.com/).
