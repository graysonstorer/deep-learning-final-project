G lobal criticism of the [treatment of hundreds of thousands of workers](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/sep/20/workers-qatar-world-cup-football-stadiums-toil-in-debt-and-squalor) from countries such as Nepal, India and Bangladesh who have been building Qatar’s World Cup dream led to the Gulf state introducing a range of labour policy changes that it says have improved the lives of the migrant workforce. Have those changes worked and how likely are they to be sustained after the tournament? A panel of experts give their view.

**Geoffrey: ‘Is it fair play when there is nothing for the workers?’**
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The [World Cup](https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football) is like a slap in the face of workers.

I have spoken to thousands of them. They don’t know their rights; their contracts are violated; there is discriminatory pay, and then there’s the weather. People are working in severe temperatures. They get dehydrated. Workers have been dying in their sleep. These deaths may be caused by the work, and their families should be compensated.

At least there is a minimum wage now. Before, there was no way you could complain about your salary, but now you know you should get at least 1,000 rials a month (£245). The problem is that it is too low. Way too low. How many billions of dollars has [Qatar](https://www.theguardian.com/world/qatar) spent on preparations for the World Cup? The minimum wage is a drop in the ocean.

> We are dealing with new laws and new institutions, and changing practices that have been deeply entrenched for decades

Max Tuñón, International Labour Organization
_[Kafala](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/sep/01/new-employment-law-effectively-ends-qatars-exploitative-kafala-system)_ [a system under which workers cannot freely change jobs] was abolished for two or three months only. After that, these powerful Qataris who own big companies complained and the changes were watered down. Now there is a requirement to get your company to approve your resignation. This is like bringing the _kafala_ system again through the back door.

The first time I was detained in Qatar was for trying to change my job. I could deal with it because I know my rights, but what about the thousands of workers who don’t know their rights? People have been deported just for trying to change companies.

Fifa talks a lot about “fair play”. Is it really fair play when there is nothing for the workers? Yes, a lot of workers got employment but it was under exploitative conditions. I think a country’s human rights record should be part of the evaluation process when awarding a World Cup. For Fifa, it was an afterthought.

*   _Geoffrey, a Kenyan, worked in Qatar for three and a half years. While there, he also worked for the human rights group_ _Equidem_ _as a researcher and advocate for workers’ rights. He was detained three times and has now returned home, where he continues his advocacy work_

**Max****Tuñón****: ‘Now workers can negotiate for better conditions’**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Earlier this year, we commissioned a survey among 1,000 low-wage workers, and found that 86% of respondents felt that [the labour reforms](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2020/sep/01/new-employment-law-effectively-ends-qatars-exploitative-kafala-system) had positively affected their lives.

Changes to the _kafala_ system have led to labour mobility. Now workers can negotiate for better conditions, and employers are incentivised to provide them in order to attract and retain talent.

Legislation has also been introduced on the minimum wage, on protecting outdoor workers during the summer months, and on the election of migrant worker representatives within companies.

Over the past five years, the government has engaged closely with the ILO [International Labour Organization], international trade unions, NGOs and others. Notably, staff from the global unions are based with us here in Doha, raising awareness among workers, and helping them to resolve the problems they face.

> There’s no accountability. The government doesn’t enforce its own laws effectively

Construction manager
There is universal acknowledgment that the work is not complete. Among our top priorities, there’s the need to address the retaliation by some employers against workers who wish to change jobs; to streamline access to justice and the recovery of due wages; and to ensure that the law protecting domestic workers is fully implemented.

We are all impatient to see the reforms fully applied and enforced, but we also recognise that we are dealing with new laws and new institutions, and changing practices that have been deeply entrenched for decades.

The World Cup was never the finish line, but rather a key milestone in Qatar’s longer-term strategy, which includes competing for skilled workers in an increasingly global market.

*   _Max_ _Tuñón is the head of the ILO project office in Qatar. The ILO has been working in partnership with the Qatari authorities since 2018 to introduce labour reforms_ _._

**Construction manager: ‘All they want is to tick boxes’**
----------------------------------------------------------

The companies I work for are just getting away with everything. There are many people now walking around Qatar who have lost their jobs, haven’t received their end-of-service benefits or months of salary. I’ve seen a lot of good people suffer and it’s absolutely linked to the World Cup.

Qatar wanted to build everything as cheaply as possible. All the big contractors were fighting one another to win the work. They were winning jobs at any cost. As Qatar started slowing down its construction [before the World Cup], all these contractors then started to face problems … and where they save their money is by not paying suppliers or our salaries and end of services.

> Reforms and reactions have been to primarily ward off criticism, without focusing on buy-in and behavioural change locally

Vani Saraswathi, Migrant Rights
All the government and supreme committee [the local body organising the World Cup] want to do is tick boxes, show a good report and just hope and pray that no one finds out.

I’ve worked on a number of World Cup projects and we had good workers’ accommodation and bad workers’ accommodation. We did all our inspections at the good accommodation. This is how it works.

There’s no accountability. The government doesn’t enforce its own laws effectively. They did allow workers to change jobs … but the bad companies were losing all their workers, so the owners went to the government and said, “Stop this.”

It’s 50% the contractors’ fault and 50% the government’s fault. The country is too small for them not to know what’s going on.

Once the World Cup’s finished, that’s it. The eyes of the world will no longer be on Qatar. They’ll just go back to how they were.

**Vani Saraswathi****: ‘The true test will happen after the World Cup’**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Qatar has made significant strides in terms of labour reforms in the past five years. In a region hostile to civil society interventions or criticism, Qatar has engaged with its critics. No doubt the World Cup was effective leverage to compel it to do so.

When we speak of reforms, we have two main components – in principle, what’s been implemented and, in practice, what’s been enforced. Much of our concern is with the latter.

> Every claim of reform the Qatari authorities make has to be heavily caveated

Pete Pattisson, investigative journalist
The removal of the no-objection certificate [which workers required from their employer in order to change jobs] was by far the most important of the changes. It gave migrant workers an opportunity to tap into the local job market for better opportunities. For the first few months, the job change process was almost seamless, until employers started pushing back. Other parts of the _kafala_ system, particularly the power of employers to report workers as “absconding”, were misused to keep workers in check, negating to a large degree the effectiveness of the reforms.

Advocates for Qatar keep arguing – weakly, in my opinion – that cultural change will take longer and what must be appreciated are the changes in law. This is not about culture but selective reforms that still give power to the employer.

The true test, and the real opportunity for meaningful change, will happen after the World Cup. The relentless – and, at times, unfair – scrutiny Qatar has faced in the last 12 years means reforms and reactions have been to primarily ward off criticism, without focusing on buy-in and behavioural change locally. As a result, the powerful business owners cock a snook at the reforms and continue unchecked with their exploitative practices.

I’d like to believe Qatar will not regress on its legal commitments post-2022, but if they are to be enforced, it will require dialogue at the grassroots level to show that ensuring the human rights of migrant workers and business profitability is not a zero-sum game.

**Pete Pattisson: ‘The system is effectively still in place’**
--------------------------------------------------------------

Qatar’s two flagship labour reforms are the introduction of a minimum wage and the abolition of the _kafala_ system. The first is a scandal, the second largely a failure.

The [minimum wage](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/01/low-wage-workers-have-paid-dearly-for-qatar-world-cup) is the equivalent of about £1 an hour. This is poverty pay, in one of the richest countries in the world per capita. Employers must also provide food and board, or an additional allowance to pay for them. The food allowance is about £2 a day.

The abolition of _kafala_ worked for a few months, but today the system is effectively still in place. On my recent visits to Qatar, almost every worker I spoke to said they were [unable to change jobs](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/sep/21/england-football-team-hotel-world-cup-qatar-security-guards), leaving them at the mercy of abusive employers.

Both reforms only came into force 10 years after Qatar won the right to host the World Cup, and long after most of the stadiums and infrastructure were completed.

[![Image 4: Latha Bollapally, with her son Rajesh Goud, holds a picture of her husband, Madhu Bollapally, 43, a migrant worker who died in Qatar](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a1da7670d673fec65a268230057cbf1219b6359/0_349_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=460&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=60c1b86f1d13e1ef59db3d1dadf08926) Revealed: 6,500 migrant workers have died in Qatar since World Cup awarded Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/23/revealed-migrant-worker-deaths-qatar-fifa-world-cup-2022)

That is not to say nothing has changed, but every claim of reform the Qatari authorities make has to be heavily caveated.

New workers’ accommodation has been built, but many thousands still live in [squalid, overcrowded dorms](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/sep/20/workers-qatar-world-cup-football-stadiums-toil-in-debt-and-squalor).

The World Cup organising committee has introduced a scheme to partly reimburse the huge [illegal fees](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/mar/31/migrant-workers-in-qatar-forced-to-pay-billions-in-recruitment-fees-world-cup) workers are forced to pay to secure their jobs, but it only benefits a fraction of Qatar’s low-wage workforce.

Regulations have been put in place to limit labourers’ exposure to the searing summer heat, but the authorities have done little to investigate the [sudden and unexplained deaths](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/feb/23/revealed-migrant-worker-deaths-qatar-fifa-world-cup-2022) of thousands of workers. Countless families of deceased workers have been left [without compensation](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2022/apr/01/qatar-dead-migrant-workers-left-with-nothing).

The Qatari authorities and Fifa claim the World Cup will leave a lasting legacy of better workers’ rights in the country and the region. That seems unlikely. Some of the reforms have stalled even before a ball has been kicked.

At this unsettling time
-----------------------

We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could spare 37 seconds to support our most important fundraising appeal of the year.

In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year on from his second victory, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one.

From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced.

While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts.

While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel.

**Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less.**

**But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, it means we’ll show you fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you.**
