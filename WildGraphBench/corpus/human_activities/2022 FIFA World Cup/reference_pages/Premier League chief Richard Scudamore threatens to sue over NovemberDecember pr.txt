Richard Scudamore is cornered during the official Premier League season launch at Capital City Academy in London on Wednesday  ( GETTY IMAGES ) 

The Premier League is considering legal action against Fifa after its recommendation to move the 2022 World Cup to November and December threatened to wipe out the traditional English Christmas fixture list.

The league’s chief executive, Richard Scudamore, said he was “extremely disappointed” with the recommendations of Fifa’s 2022 Task Force, of which he is a member.

Moving the tournament to November and December had been widely expected, but the proposed dates that leaked out of the meeting in Doha yesterday are later than had been anticipated. The World Cup final could now take place as late as 23 December.

“Our particular concern is that a Fifa World Cup that finishes late in December could result in damaging one of the English game’s great traditions and attractions, with the removal of the entire Premier League, Football League and FA Cup Christmas and New Year fixture programme that season,” Scudamore said.

The Premier League will now “consult with our clubs and other stakeholders”, including the all-powerful broadcasters. “Clearly there is still time within the process to consider our position further...before deciding on what, if any, further action might be appropriate. It is clear that the views of the European leagues...have not been given serious consideration,” he added.

More than 50 leagues will have to be re-organised. But the Premier League may face the biggest impact in terms of the amount paid for TV rights during its busy festive period.

### About _The Independent_ commenting

Independent Minds Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Minds. It allows our most engaged readers to debate the big issues, share their own experiences, discuss real-world solutions, and more. Our journalists will try to respond by joining the threads when they can to create a true meeting of independent minds. The most insightful comments on all subjects will be published daily in dedicated articles. You can also choose to be emailed when someone replies to your comment.

The existing Open Comments threads will continue to exist for those who do not subscribe to Independent Minds. Due to the sheer scale of this comment community, we are not able to give each post the same level of attention, but we have preserved this area in the interests of open debate. Please continue to respect all commenters and create constructive debates.
