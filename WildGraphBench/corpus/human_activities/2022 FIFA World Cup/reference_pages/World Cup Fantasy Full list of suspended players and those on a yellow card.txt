World Cup Fantasy: Full list of suspended players and those on a yellow card
============================================================================

[Oli Poole](https://www.fantasyfootballhub.co.uk/author/olipoole) | Wed 30 Nov 2022

![Image 7](blob:http://localhost/194a7fa82037dc664bc7bb986e60a4fd)![Image 8: World Cup Fantasy: Full list of suspended players and those on a yellow card](https://cms.fantasyfootballhub.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Yellow-cards-World-Cup.jpg)

The World Cup is well underway – but what are the rules on yellow cards and who’s on or near a one-game ban in World Cup Fantasy?

This article guides you through everything you need to know, and lists those on a yellow card by country.

The list is updated every day.

*   [**Ultimate Guide to World Cup Fantasy 2022: Everything you need to know**](https://www.fantasyfootballhub.co.uk/world-cup-fantasy-2022-tips-the-ultimate-guide)
*   [**Expert World Cup Fantasy team reveals**](http://fantasyfootballhub.co.uk/world-cup-fantasy-2022-team-reveals/)

**Last updated: 06/12/22**

What are the rules on yellow cards at the World Cup?
----------------------------------------------------

According to FIFA’s World Cup 2022 regulations document, a player will be suspended if they receive two cautions in two different World Cup matches.

The length of the suspension is one match and is the same as a result of a red card, however FIFA warn ‘further sanctions may be imposed’ in the case of a straight red card.

Yellow cards carry over into the knockout stages but the slate is wiped clean after the quarter-finals, meaning those who reach the semi-finals would only miss the final in the event of a red card at that stage.

Who’s on a yellow card at the World Cup?
----------------------------------------

This list of yellow card recipients will be updated throughout the tournament, and is currently as follows:

### Group A

**Netherlands:**Matthijs de Ligt, Nathan Ake, Frenkie de Jong, Teun Koopmeiners

### Group B

**England:**

### Group C

**Argentina:**Gonzalo Montiel, Marcos Acuna

### **Group D**

**France:**Jules Kounde, Aurelien Tchouameni

### Group E

**Spain:**Sergio Busquets, Aymeric Laporte

### Group F

**Croatia:**Dejan Lovren, Luka Modric, Mateo Kovacic, Borna Barisic

**Morocco:**Sofyan Amrabat, Abdelhamid Sabiri, Roman Saiss

### **Group G**

**Brazil:**Fred, Eder Militao, Bruno Guimaraes

**Switzerland:** Granit Xhaka**,**Nico Elvedi, Manuel Akanji, Fabian Rieder, Ruben Vargas, Silvan Widmer, Fabian Schar

### Group H

**Portugal:**Danilo, Bruno Fernandes, Ruben Neves, Joao Felix, Ruben Dias

Who’s been suspended so far?
----------------------------

Iran’s **Alireza Jahanbakhsh**missed Iran’s final group game against the USA after picking up his second yellow card in the closing stages of the Wales game.

**Jhegson Mendez**received his second yellow of the tournament in Ecuador’s second match against the Netherlands. He missed his team’s final group game.

Two yellows for **Abdulelah Al-Malki**ruled him out of Saudi Arabia’s crunch third group game against Mexico, while **Francisco Calvo**missed Costa Rica’s match against Germany.

A booking for Belgium midfielder**Amadou Onana**meant the Everton man played no part in the Croatia game.

And while Senegal made it to the knockout stages with a win over Ecuador on Monday (November 29),**Idrissa Gueye**played no part in their round of 16 game with England after getting his second card of the tournament.

Another player to miss out on the round of 16 is Japan’s**Kou Itakura**, who was carded in the 2-1 win over Spain.

Three Serbia players picked up second bookings in their final group game, however their manager was saved a selection headache because they were eliminated.

Red cards
---------

Wales goalkeeper **Wayne Hennessey** received the first red card of the World Cup in Wales’ second group game against Iran.

**Vincent Aboubakar**scored a late winning goal against Brazil in Cameroon’s final group game. Already on a booking – and with Cameroon heading out anyway – his second yellow and subsequent red for removing his shirt in celebration mattered little.
