Dreamt up by some of the world’s leading architects, the stadiums we have proposed for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar™ are some of the most ambitious, visually exciting venues ever conceived.

[Ras Abu Aboud Stadium](https://web.archive.org/web/20171114015238/http://www.sc.qa/en/stadiums/ras-abu-aboud-stadium)

 Our stadiums will come in all shapes and sizes, and be designed to reflect the rich culture of Qatari culture. While it’s important for Qatar to honour its past, the stadiums will all be built with three leading-edge priorities in mind:

 – [Access and comfort](https://web.archive.org/web/20171114015238/http:/www.sc.qa/en/stadiums#access-comfort)

 – [Sustainability](https://web.archive.org/web/20171114015238/http:/www.sc.qa/en/stadiums#sustainability)

 – [Post-tournament legacy](https://web.archive.org/web/20171114015238/http:/www.sc.qa/en/stadiums#legacy)

Access & comfort
----------------

Advanced cooling technologies and smart design features will ensure that fans, players, officials and everyone else inside the stadiums is kept cool, whatever the weather conditions outside. Shaded walkways, and new metro and rail links will make matchday journeys smooth, comfortable and environmentally friendly.

It goes without saying that each venue being delivered by the Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC) and our stakeholders will be accessible by visitors with disabilities. Our modern stadiums will incorporate priority parking, wheelchair ramps, lifts, and accessible seating areas offering superior views.

Sustainability
--------------

Achieving sustainable development is a key objective of the State of Qatar and the SC, so all proposed 2022 FIFA World Cup™ stadiums are being built with a resolute focus on the future.

We are working towards[Global Sustainability Assessment System (GSAS) certification](https://web.archive.org/web/20171114015238/http://www.gord.qa/)for all stadiums. To gain accreditation, and to create venues that the next generation can be proud of, only the most environmentally friendly practices and materials are being used. Renewable and low energy solutions are being incorporated wherever possible, helping stadiums to become energy self-sufficient and even to power other facilities in some cases.

Transportation systems taking fans to stadiums will also assist in the journey towards sustainability.[Qatar Rail](https://web.archive.org/web/20171114015238/https://www.qr.com.qa/English/Pages/default.aspx)is currently building metro, rail and light rail systems that will take cars off the road, further reducing the environmental impact of the 2022 FIFA World Cup™ stadiums – and helping Qatar to build a greener future for us all.

Legacy
------

The 2022 FIFA World Cup™ will give Qatar and the Middle East a set of world-class stadiums, magnets for future events of every kind. More importantly, these stadiums will be suitable for Qatar’s domestic football league as well as other local sporting and cultural events.

Many of the venues will feature modular designs to allow excess seating to be removed post-2022. These seats will be donated to football projects around the globe, helping to spread the love of the game and spurring its worldwide development. The stadiums’ reduced capacities will create arenas of the right size for local football and other sporting events, guaranteeing a vibrant atmosphere.

The areas surrounding Qatar’s FIFA World Cup™ stadiums will become focal points for their communities. The precincts will enjoy high-quality sporting facilities, parks, schools, transport links, shopping centres and places of worship. These amenities will be vital cogs in helping the country to achieve the development goals set in out the [Qatar National Vision 2030](https://web.archive.org/web/20171114015238/http://www.mdps.gov.qa/en/qnv/Pages/default.aspx).

Whenever they visit or even glimpse these stadiums, people from Qatar and the region will feel a deep sense of pride.
