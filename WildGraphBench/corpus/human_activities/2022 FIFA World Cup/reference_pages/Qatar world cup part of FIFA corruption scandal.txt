 Phaedra Almajid, speaking to the BBC in December 2014 

The weight of evidence against Qatar’s World Cup bid will see it stripped of the tournament as part of a series of reforms designed to “save Sepp Blatter’s skin”, according to a prominent Fifa whistleblower.

Phaedra Almajid, who was a media officer for the Qatar bid team before losing her job in 2010 and going public with allegations of corruption, is currently living under FBI protection in the US.

Fifa has previously questioned her testimony, and said there were “serious concerns” about the credibility of her statements to the internal probe led by Michael Garcia. Almajid says her evidence was supposed to be confidential, and that she was exposed by Fifa in a bid to “smear” her.

Speaking to the [Mail on Sunday](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/sportsnews/article-3113870/Qatar-stripped-2022-World-Cup-according-country-s-whistleblower.html), Almajid said she welcomed the dramatic developments in the corruption scandal since the arrests in Switzerland on 27 May, and predicted Fifa will soon be left with no option but to find another host for the 2022 World Cup.

Contenders to replace Sepp Blatter as Fifa president
====================================================

1/6 Michel Platini
------------------

Current president of Uefa. Voted for the Qatar World Cup, which makes position somewhat difficult. Asked Blatter to resign before elections.

2/6 Prince Ali Al-Hussein
-------------------------

The Jordanian was the only contender against Blatter when the elections took place. Managed to pick up 73 votes from the Fifa executive committee to Blatter's 133. Has already confirmed he will stand again.

3/6 David Gill
--------------

The former Manchester United chief executive refused to take up his place on the Uefa executive committee after Blatter's re-election. 'My professional reputation is critical to me and I simply do not see how there will be change for the good of world football while Mr Blatter remains in post,' he said at the time. 

Reuters

4/6 Luis Figo
-------------

Former Real Madrid and Barcelona player announced himself as a candidate for the most recent election but pulled out in protest at how it was being run, saying the process was 'anything but an election'.

5/6 Jerome Champagne
--------------------

Also announced himself as president contender but failed to gain the minimum five nominations required. The Frenchman is a former Fifa deputy general secretary and has been a fierce critic of Uefa.

6/6 Michael van Praag
---------------------

Dutch FA president was also a contender for president before pulling out in order not to split support between himself and Price Ali.

But she also said the prospect of Qatar losing the tournament “scares [her] a lot” because she might become the target of “extremists” who blame her for speaking out.

Almajid said she expects outgoing Fifa president Sepp Blatter to announce the reopening of the 2022 host ballot as part of the series of reforms he has promised to push through before a new chief is named.

She said: “I just don’t think Blatter actually intends to quit. Everything he does is very calculated. He’ll try very hard to save himself, I’m sure of it.”

Qatar has strongly denied Almajid’s claims that its officials paid Fifa delegates to win their votes. When she repeated her allegations towards the end of last year and said she feared for her life, the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee said: “We stand by the quality and integrity of our bid and will not comment further at this time on allegations that have been, over a period of years, investigated, tested, considered and dismissed.”

### About _The Independent_ commenting

Independent Premium Comments can be posted by members of our membership scheme, Independent Premium. It allows our most engaged readers to debate the big issues, share their own experiences, discuss real-world solutions, and more. Our journalists will try to respond by joining the threads when they can to create a true meeting of independent Premium. The most insightful comments on all subjects will be published daily in dedicated articles. You can also choose to be emailed when someone replies to your comment.

The existing Open Comments threads will continue to exist for those who do not subscribe to Independent Premium. Due to the sheer scale of this comment community, we are not able to give each post the same level of attention, but we have preserved this area in the interests of open debate. Please continue to respect all commenters and create constructive debates.
