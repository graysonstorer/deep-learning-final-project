[Germany](https://theathletic.com/football/team/germany/) exit the [World Cup](https://theathletic.com/football/world-cup/) despite a 4-2 win against [Costa Rica](https://theathletic.com/football/team/costa-rica/).

Victory for [Japan](https://theathletic.com/football/team/japan/) against [Spain](https://theathletic.com/football/team/spain/) consigned Germany to third place, meaning they exit the World Cup in the group stages for the second successive tournament.

A good showing from Costa Rica
------------------------------

After the 7-0 defeat to open the tournament, what we saw in the last two games was real fight from the Costa Ricans. Yes, they were exposed once they opened up against Germany, but to beat Japan and then briefly hold a lead over Germany in the group finale showed the spirit of a country that did not let that opening result define their tournament. Costa Rica now faces a key stretch where they will turn over the program to a group of young players that is starting to break through. Some will argue it should have happened more in this tournament. But even in a 4-2 defeat, the Ticos displayed more about their identity as a nation and as a footballing culture than was on display against Spain.

Game over for Germany. They shouldn't expect kind words from the media back at home, because this really hasn't been good enough, whatever their squad's limitations may be.

They dug a hole against Japan, dug in admirably against Spain, but this was a very meagre effort, regardless of the four goals they scored.

_Tschuss!_

> Germany haven't been unlucky. They've scored four but been largely pedestrian tonight and probably deserve the other result to have gone against them.

JAPAN HAVE WON THE OTHER GAME
-----------------------------

Which means that... Germany are eliminated in the group stage for the second successive World Cup.

That is an absolute disaster for Hansi Flick and the DFB.

Havertz
-------

Not that it matters that much, but Kai Havertz has been really good since coming on. He's scored two, set up a tap-in for Fullkrug and generally been everything he wasn't and Germany have lacked throughout much of this tournament.

Into stoppage time: 10 added minutes
------------------------------------

Ten?

Ten?

TEN?

Germany need a goal every 90 seconds to advance.

89mins: GOAL Germany
--------------------

Again, it doesn't change all that much, but Fullkrug has scored Germany's fourth. They've won, we know that now, but all eyes are on Japan-Spain for the remaining minutes. It's still 2-1 in that game and they're into the 89th minute.

84mins: GOAL GERMANY
--------------------

Havertz has scored again after tapping in Gnabry's cross to the back-post, but it doesn't change much yet. Japan are still leading and as long as that stays the same, they and Spain will go through.

3-2.

The Athletic's Editor-in-Chief has a suggestion and it's a pretty good one.

75mins: SAVE!
-------------

Keylor Navas hasn't had a great tournament, but he might have just produced one of its best saves.

A Germany break leaves Fullkrug with what looks like a tap-in at the back post. He makes good contact, but Navas somehow recovers his ground, gets across his goal, and diverts the ball over the top.

A stupendous save. Goodness, that's brilliant goalkeeping.

73mins: GOAL Germany
--------------------

2-2.

CAN EVERYONE STOP SCORING GOALS.

Kai Havertz has equalised! It doesn't mean much for Germany yet, but Spain are back in the Round of 16 as it stands.

70mins: GOAL Costa Rica
-----------------------

This is some proper nonsense from the German defence. A Costa Rica free-kick is swung in from wide on the left and a German defender fails to win any of the headers that follow.

With a final touch, Vargas steers the ball beyond Neuer and gently into the German net.

An awful goal to concede...

Costa Rica's fighting spirit
----------------------------

The fight of the Ticos since that 7-0 loss has been something special. They have shown a willingness to keep fighting and to find ways into games.

And here's it's a connection of a right back, Fuller, to a center back, Kendall Waston, and then eventually finished off by Yeltsin Tejeda.

Germany have come flying back with chance after chance, but the crowd here has broken out with some Costa Rica chants to cheer on the Central American side.

Subs: Havertz and Gotze on for Muller and Raum
----------------------------------------------

Who knows how that changes the shape for Germany, but at this point its all an act of desperation from Hansi Flick.

60mins: POST!
-------------

Musiala slices through the Costa Rican defence down the other end and, instead of squaring for Fullkrug, takes on the chance himself. It's nearly brilliant, but the shot comes back off the inside of the post and bounces clear.

A minute later, Rudiger hits the OTHER SIDE of the same post after stealing in ahead of his marker.

Doesn't feel like it's going to be Germany's night...

1-1!

A half-saved diving header falls to Yeltsin Tejeda and he scores his FIRST EVER INTERNATIONAL GOAL.

54mins: Fullkrug on
-------------------

Germany need goals in a hurry and Hansi Flick has gone to his bench. Ilkay Gundogan is off, Niclas Fullkrug is on.

By our calculations, Germany need another six goals to move level with Spain on points, goal-difference and head-to-head. Germany have had three yellow cards so far and Spain have been awarded one though, so that would need to change also if they're to avoid elimination.

News from the other game
------------------------

Japan have equalised and that means... gets out calculator... that as it stands, Germany would be out on the head-to-head rule.

They need another goal.

HT: Subs for both teams
-----------------------

Leon Goretzka is off and Lukas Klostermann is on. Kostermann is a full-back, so that will push Kimmich into midfield alongside Gundogan.

Brandon Aguilera has come off for Costa Rica and he's been replaced by Youstin Salas.
