# England played well against France. Ultimately, that doesn't matter

Didier Deschamps had been speaking for 10 minutes, expressing pride in the qualities that had taken his [France](https://theathletic.com/football/team/france/) team to within 90 minutes of a second successive [World Cup](https://theathletic.com/football/world-cup/) final. Not so much _liberte, egalite, fraternite_ as _qualite, humilite, fraternite_.

He said they had been pushed close to their limits by strong opponents, lauding [England](https://theathletic.com/football/team/england/)’s technical ability and their intensity. “They’re so quick, so strong, so energetic, that we had to defend very well,” the France coach said. “It comes down to small details and luckily, tonight it went our way. You need a bit of luck sometimes.”

It was everything an English audience wanted to hear: soft elevator music to bring comfort in that biennial moment of _tristesse._

And then Deschamps said something a little more blunt. After praising the attitude his players had shown since this World Cup began — in every meeting, every mealtime and every training session — he said, “But none of it is worth anything if you don’t get the results.”

Or, as his match-winner [Olivier Giroud](https://theathletic.com/football/player/olivier-giroud-jQhFvachd9LT7tAr/) put it even more bluntly when he spoke to _The Athletic_ on his way out of the stadium: “The truth of the pitch talked tonight.”

The World Cup is brutal. England have known that for decades, experiencing just about every type of elimination since that isolated triumph on home soil in 1966: snatching defeat from the jaws of victory (1970), bowing to a stroke of genius (1986, 2002), penalty shootout agony after battling heroically (1990, 1998), penalty shootout agony after falling short (2006), not being quite good enough (1982, 2018) and not being anywhere near good enough (2010, 2014). Add a dash of refereeing controversy, a pinch of conspiracy theory, and you should start to bring out all the rich flavours of an English post-tournament inquest.

Where does Saturday night’s quarter-final fit into all that? It’s hard to say, really.

There were familiar frustrations with a referee, familiar regrets over a missed penalty ([Harry Kane](https://theathletic.com/football/player/harry-kane-47vQtg5y5Ub8iFqb/) converting his first but skying his second with the chance to equalise late in the game) and a familiar sense of hand-wringing over those instances where England just lacked that extra bit of something. But it was a defeat that didn’t easily, instantly lend itself to any particular pigeonhole.

Perhaps the most familiar aspect was that England were beaten by the first top-tier nation they ran into at a tournament. It’s all very well beating [Iran](https://theathletic.com/football/team/iran/), [Wales](https://theathletic.com/football/team/wales/) and [Senegal](https://theathletic.com/football/team/senegal/), but they fell short — narrowly — against France, just as they did against West Germany in 1970 and 1990, [Argentina](https://theathletic.com/football/team/argentina/) in 1986 and 1998, [Brazil](https://theathletic.com/football/team/brazil/) in 2002, and so on.

England were beaten by a better team — although the confusing thing is that, as on a couple of those previous occasions (against West Germany in 1990 and Argentina in 1998 (and you can add the Euro 96 semi-final against the Germans to that), they were not necessarily inferior on the night.

As their manager Gareth Southgate said, they went “toe-to-toe” with the reigning world champions and “didn’t look out of place”. He suggested the performance was “probably the best we’ve played against a major nation across the period I’ve been in charge”, and he was probably right.

“But we’ve fallen short,” Southgate added. “And in the end, the scoreline is all that matters.”

We’re back to the brutality of the World Cup — “the truth of the pitch”, as Giroud put it, and when it came down to it, a strong, measured, confident, technically-proficient England performance still wasn’t quite enough.

You could try to put it down to France’s greater experience. [Hugo Lloris](https://theathletic.com/football/player/hugo-lloris-Bwqo0JNjOYvtJCMn/), [Raphael Varane](https://theathletic.com/football/player/raphael-varane-fqIirRcGC4muo1f5/), [Antoine Griezmann](https://theathletic.com/football/player/antoine-griezmann-LNIx9qsJKyPzrxjt/) and Giroud were making their 143rd, 91st, 115th and 118th international appearances respectively. All are world champions, as is [Kylian Mbappe](https://theathletic.com/football/player/kylian-mbappe-vqEQPtKAKLluodtc/), who, at the age of 23, already has 64 international appearances and 33 goals to his name.

But as Deschamps pointed out, France have evolved since that triumph in 2018. Beyond that core of elder statesmen, there were [Jules Kounde](https://theathletic.com/football/player/jules-kounde-eNFXh1X41fiInMxq/) (winning his 16th cap), [Dayot Upamecano](https://theathletic.com/football/player/dayot-upamecano-RPVsvRtyABioBr7H/), [Theo Hernandez](https://theathletic.com/football/player/theo-hernandez-Kw8dlLxh5HDhk9JV/) (both 11th), and [Aurelien Tchouameni](https://theathletic.com/football/player/aurelien-tchouameni-3s27o6UtUPTcnWv5/) (19th). [Adrien Rabiot](https://theathletic.com/football/player/adrien-rabiot-FlqHlMtYfzI0Nlfb/) and [Ousmane Dembele](https://theathletic.com/football/player/ousmane-dembele-n2omWOfBdvkJ6c6U/) have 34 and 33 caps respectively.

Surprisingly, perhaps, of the 27 players who appeared over the course of the evening, the four with the fewest caps were in the France starting line-up.

In many ways, it felt like watching last season’s [Champions League](https://theathletic.com/football/champions-league/) semi-final and final, when [Real Madrid](https://theathletic.com/football/team/real-madrid/) — vastly experienced in some areas of the team but very youthful in others — overcame [Manchester City](https://theathletic.com/football/team/manchester-city/) and [Liverpool](https://theathletic.com/football/team/liverpool/) when, on the balance of play, they had not looked superior. There was an understandable urge to put it all down to their experience and know-how when, in reality, it looked rather more nuanced than that.

There are so many variables in football, particularly in knockout ties between well-matched teams. We have seen that throughout this World Cup. Of the four quarter-finals, two went to penalty shootouts and the other two were decided by a one-goal margin, so what did Argentina, [Croatia](https://theathletic.com/football/team/croatia/), [Morocco](https://theathletic.com/football/team/morocco/) and France have that the [Netherlands](https://theathletic.com/football/team/netherlands/), Brazil, [Portugal](https://theathletic.com/football/team/portugal/) and England did not?

Composure from the penalty spot is one obvious answer. Experience? Know-how? To some extent, possibly, but then how do you explain Morocco’s victories here over [Belgium](https://theathletic.com/football/team/belgium/), [Spain](https://theathletic.com/football/team/spain/) and Portugal? Tactical discipline, tenacity, never-say-die spirit, _fraternite_…?

This is a rare period in England’s history when they seem to have developed some combination of those qualities. After a decade of underachievement (1996-2006) was followed by one of drift (2006-16), Southgate has built a team with an identity, a sense of unity and the ability to play intelligently both with and without the ball.

They have become a credible, competitive team under Southgate: reaching the World Cup semi-finals in 2018, the [European Championship](https://theathletic.com/football/european-championship/) final last year (losing on penalties to [Italy](https://theathletic.com/football/team/italy/)) and now a World Cup quarter-final.

Some, seeing it purely in black-and-white terms, will insist that defeat in the last eight of this tournament therefore means regression. Most of us will feel that, having got lucky with the draw at the previous World Cup, they were a far better team four years on, but this time they had the misfortune to run into France (rather than Sweden) at the quarter-final stage. Such are the vagaries of international football.

Had you asked after that World Cup or Euro 2020 what England really lack, it would have been the ability to control and dictate the rhythm of a game, particularly against high-class opposition. [That remains a challenge for English football](https://theathletic.com/2777438/2021/08/19/where-is-englands-pirlo/) — perhaps a solution will arise if [Phil Foden](https://theathletic.com/football/player/phil-foden-XPGfB4Asse0ZuH48/) of Manchester City gets the long-anticipated opportunity to evolve in a deeper role for club and country — but it wasn’t necessarily the issue last night against France.

If anything, what England lacked was ruthlessness. That is less about Kane’s penalty miss than about the feeling that they didn’t display quite enough of the killer instinct you need at this level. Too often, the final ball was overhit into the grateful arms of Lloris or there were not enough players — and at times, this applied to Kane — getting into goalscoring positions when [Bukayo Saka](https://theathletic.com/football/player/bukayo-saka-KM98BOcjxMZ919HO/) had the beating of left-back Hernandez.

Kane’s failure from the spot was the first penalty England have ever missed at the World Cup (outside of shootouts). They had converted all of their previous 12 spot kicks:

Harry's heartbreak

| PLAYER/WORLD CUP | OPPOSITION/ROUND | WHAT HAPPENED |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tom Finney in 1958 | Soviet Union (Groups) | Scored |
| Ron Flowers in 1962 | Hungary (Groups) | Scored |
| Ron Flowers in 1962 | Argentina (Groups) | Scored |
| Allan Clarke in 1970 | Czechoslovakia (Groups) | Scored |
| Gary Lineker in 1990 | Cameroon (QF) | Scored |
| Gary Lineker in 1990 | Cameroon (QF) | Scored |
| Alan Shearer in 1998 | Argentina (R16) | Scored |
| David Beckham in 2002 | Argentina (Groups) | Scored |
| Harry Kane in 2018 | Panama (Groups) | Scored |
| Harry Kane in 2018 | Panama (Groups) | Scored |
| Harry Kane in 2018 | Colombia (R16) | Scored |
| Harry Kane in 2022 | France (QF) | Scored |
| Harry Kane in 2022 | France (QF) | Missed |

Then, there is that other type of ruthlessness: the hard-nosed, bloody-minded type that Argentina, Croatia and, yes, Morocco have displayed by the bucketload. The last of [Qatar](https://theathletic.com/football/team/qatar/) 2022’s quarter-finals was arguably the most compelling from a technical viewpoint but it didn’t seem to have quite the same emotional intensity or the same air of belligerence of the first three, which is surprising when you consider that, for years, England were renowned for their fighting spirit and little else.

Are England now too nice? Is Southgate too nice? It is a tired trope but maybe it contains a small degree of truth.

At times in the past, it seemed delusional to suggest that all England needed was to be a little bit more streetwise — as if the John Terry, Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney generation were incapable of grasping some of the game’s darker arts! — but maybe this England team does lack a certain… nastiness. They depart the competition with a single yellow card from their five games.

None of this is intended to sound regressive. England have developed into a sensible, mature, progressive team. They are intelligent, tactically disciplined, confident with and without the ball. They are a team with a modern identity and, with young players of the quality of [Declan Rice](https://theathletic.com/football/player/declan-rice-duZsAMRHQ2yZkpLT/), [Jude Bellingham](https://theathletic.com/football/player/jude-bellingham-TNshgOhgjwrh7Xh5/), Saka and Foden on an upward curve, they should be better than this by the time Euro 2024 comes around in 18 months.

It is just that the very best teams, the trophy-winning teams, are the ones who find a way to dig in and get a result, even when things appear to be going against them.

France certainly rode their luck when Hernandez stupidly clattered [Mason Mount](https://theathletic.com/football/player/mason-mount-nxh7ubMYybqCSabx/) to concede that second penalty, but looking at the game as a whole they appeared just a little more ruthless than England. Not necessarily “better” on the night, but more ruthless.

Deschamps referred to England’s counter-attacking threat and how he was pleased his team had dealt with it. He didn’t point out that their first means of doing so was to concede free kicks deep in English territory to stop Saka or Foden getting away, but it went without saying. Cynical and frustrating as it might be, that is part of the game — and it was one area last night where France were unquestionably smarter.

Lloris said that “in games like this, you have to be ruthless in every way” — and he was right. He knows from bitter experience at his English club, [Tottenham Hotspur](https://theathletic.com/football/team/tottenham-hotspur/), how it feels to end up on the wrong side of that equation, coming up against opponents who have the know-how and the muscle memory to get the job done.

Is that ultimately the issue? Are England the Tottenham of international football? “Lads, it’s England”, and all that? Possibly not, but Giorgio Chiellini spoke in 2018 about how “the history of Tottenham” put them at a disadvantage in a Champions League tie against his [Juventus](https://theathletic.com/football/team/juventus/) team. Maybe the veteran defender would reflect similarly on his Italy side’s victory over England in that European Championship final last year.

It’s a Catch-22 thing. To win a trophy, you need to develop a winning mentality. To develop a winning mentality, you need to win a trophy.

At some point, you need to break that cycle of failure — and England have rarely felt closer to doing so than in the past few years under Southgate — but still, that certain something eludes them: that last critical ingredient, that _je ne sais quoi_.

Some would say that they simply need to replace Southgate with a proven winner. But those same people probably said similar when Tottenham replaced Mauricio Pochettino with Jose Mourinho. It doesn’t often work that way.

International football is a strange beast, particularly when it comes down to the knockout stage, and at no stage since 1966 have England appeared more in tune — technically, tactically, psychologically — with the unique challenges of competing in tournaments.

But there will always be matches where it comes down to how Giroud put it.

The “truth of the pitch” speaks and the harsh truth is that England still keep falling narrowly short.

And so minds turn towards the 2024 European Championship in Germany, by which time this team should be two years wiser as well as two years older. But you have probably heard that one before.
