World Cup 2022: Japan 0-1 Costa Rica - Keysher Fuller earns shock win
=====================================================================

By Matt Gault BBC Sport

Last updated on 27 November 2022 27 November 2022.From the section [World Cup](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup)[](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63692163)639

Japan failed to take another step towards the World Cup knockout rounds as Keysher Fuller's late goal earned Costa Rica a smash-and-grab Group E victory.

Following their [shock win over Germany,](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63644792) Japan were frustrated by a tight defensive unit, before Fuller struck with Costa Rica's first shot on target at the tournament.

The result leaves both teams on three points after two games, with Spain - who still top the group on goal difference - facing Germany later on Sunday (19:00 GMT).

Victory for Spain will all but guarantee their progression to the last 16.

*   [How Japan 0-1 Costa Rica unfolded](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/live/football/61016539)

After beating Germany in their opener, many expected [Japan](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/japan) to account for a Costa Rica side reeling from a [7-0 thrashing by Spain.](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63644789)

However, Japan boss Hajime Moriyasu opted for rotation over continuity, making five changes, and that resulted in a subdued performance and a scoreline that blew the group wide open.

It was a remarkable victory for [Costa Rica,](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/costa-rica) who had failed to lay a glove on the Japan defence before Fuller's deflected shot from the edge of the box escaped goalkeeper Shuichi Gonda's grasp nine minutes from time.

After a first half devoid of goalmouth action in the searing heat at Ahmad Bin Ali Stadium, Japan dominated for large spells. However, they struggled to create clear-cut chances until the 88th minute, when Daichi Kamada could not turn the ball home after a driving Kaoru Mitoma run.

Having achieved redemption following their humiliation at the hands of Spain, the Costa Rica players celebrated emotionally at full-time as Japan were left to rue a disappointing display that failed to back up their heroics against Germany.

12:14 27 Nov 2022   A lesson for Southgate.

ATTACK, ATTACK, ATTACK

Passing the ball sideways gets you nowhere.     102    20

Passing the ball sideways has probably got England into the knock out phase whereas Japan are now at risk.      59    34

12:13 27 Nov 2022   My word that was awful!

And almost a crime that Costa Rica came away with all 3 points having put in almost no effort in attack. It wasn't even good defending, just poor in the final third by Japan.     75    9

12:10 27 Nov 2022   It wasn’t a shock win. If you had looked at this game before the World Cup, and not based on what happened in the first games, you would have said these sides were fairly evenly matched so a 1-0 win for either would not have been a surprise     51    9

Japan already thinking about the next match from the start. Gambling odds were ridiculously too far in favour of Japan, I thought Costa Rica could nick it. Japan just flushed its golden ticket, paid for diabolical first half. Only Mitoma made them look like scoring.      14    0

12:34 27 Nov 2022   Seen coverage of every WC from 1966 onwards. Plenty of duff games & uninspiring tournaments. This year at last I can watch as much as I like but it's been dull game after dull game. Not FIFA's fault, not Qatar's fault, not even the fault of the ITV & BBC presenters. It's negativity played out by functional athletes rather than skilled footballers. Change the mindset or make the goals bigger.     14    1
