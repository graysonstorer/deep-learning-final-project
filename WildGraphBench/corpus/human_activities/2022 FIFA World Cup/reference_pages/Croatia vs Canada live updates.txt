Next up: Spain vs Germany
-------------------------

The big one. Germany playing to keep their hopes alive - though they were helped out majorly by Japan's loss to Costa Rica.

Player of the match — Andrej Kramaric
-------------------------------------

Mateo Kovacic probably had a more perfect game — his first-half was almost flawless. But for narrative, this award is going to go to Andrej Kramaric. The Hoffenheim forward has had a difficult few days.

Blamed for much of Croatia’s insipid attacking performance against Morocco, the pressure was squarely on the 31-year-old’s shoulders, playing out wide to facilitate Hajduk Split’s Livaja. He might have wilted after having an equaliser ruled out for offside, but provided a fine finish from the left to draw Croatia level. Livaja equalised soon after, and Kramaric might have added early in the second-half.

However, the golden moment came in the 70th minute, when he collected a raking cross-field pass, touched it inside, and finished low across the keeper. A beautiful goal. Clinical edge restored. A hat-trick almost came moments later.

Thank you Canada

Despite two losses, they've really enhanced the competition. Roll on hosting in 2026.

FINAL: 4-1 Croatia
------------------

![Image 8: CRO](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

Despite scoring early today, Canada is eliminated from the 2022 World Cup with a game to go. They'll look to thwart Morocco's quest to advance to the knockouts in their finale on Thursday.

Croatia scores four, more than they managed in any match of their run to the 2018 World Cup final. They sit atop Group F, level on points with Morocco but up by a single goal in the GD category. Belgium is third with three points, most likely needing to beat Croatia to advance.

4-1; Canada's on ice
--------------------

Back to hockey for the North American nation, as a Kamal Miller flub leaves Croatia with a two-man break against Milan Borjan and zero defenders.

Oršić does most of the dribbling, then squares it to Lovro Majer for the finish — which the late substitution nearly skied but luckily rattled the roof of the net.

Croatia won't leave unscathed
-----------------------------

You know that move from the old Super Smash Bros 64, where Donkey Kong could grab an opponent on his back and walk off the edge to take a life from each player? Kamal Miller does something of the sort on Canada's way out of the World Cup, getting into a quarrel with Luka Modric which results in both players seeing a yellow card.

Modric will have to keep a clean nose against Belgium, or else he'll risk suspension. Players are suspended for a match for acquiring two yellow cards between the group stage opener and the quarterfinal. It seems a bit harsh, if you ask me, but alas.

![Image 12: CRO](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

Wind fully out of Canada's sails now. The usually-confident side have been undone by poor decisions going forward and lax defending at the back. Canadian fans are mostly silent; they seem to know that this spells the end for their country's first World Cup in a generation.

When Group F was drawn, there were two clear favorites to advance. While Belgium struggled to get past Canada and fell to a capable Moroccan side, Croatia has flexed its muscles as it appears to have knocked Canada out after 180 minutes.

Looks like a team that'll have a large role to play in the knockouts.

Jonathan David's day is done after having a mixed impact on Canada's attacking aims. He's replaced by Lucas Cavalini, while Atiba Hutchinson exits for Sam Adekugbe.

Meanwhile, goalscorer Kramaric exits to loud ovation and is replaced by Torino's Nikola Vlašić as they look to close the game out. Earlier in the half, Bruno Petkovic checked in for the other Croatian goalscorer, Marko Livaja.

Croatia makes it three
----------------------

Andrej Kramarić makes it a brace. Canada's defense caught absolutely sound asleep in the box, allowing the Hoffenheim striker to collect the ball, calmly slide it onto his left foot, and then pass between Atiba Hutchinson's legs and beyond Milan Borjan.

Way too easy. Far too casual of defending — and now, Canada is 20 minutes away from being eliminated from knockout contention.

Are Canada tiring?
------------------

Just losing a bit of zip in midfield here after a frantic first-half. Croatia's substitutes feel more up with the speed of the game.

SUB Canada
----------

Junior Hoilett checks in for Canada, replacing Richie Laryea.

Another change in approach from John Herdmann, taking dribbly boi Laryea off for more of a dead-ball technician like Hoilett.

Hope they omitted the applicator
--------------------------------

Atiba Hutchison receives treatment from Canada's medical staff on the sideline, and is now playing with what appears to be a tampon up his nose.

BETTER from Canada
------------------

On the latest counter, Canada seems to remember the rest of its stars. Bad Bunny look-alike Jonathan Osorio progressed into the area before sending it wide for Tajon Buchanan. Rather than crossing, the Brugge man sent it to Jonathan David, whose shot was parried over the bar.

![Image 21: Jeff Rueter](https://cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=100,quality=90/app/uploads/2021/04/23212244/DSC_3097.jpg)

Same issues as last match?
--------------------------

At this stage, it looks as though Canada is attaching all of its hopes to Alphonso Davies. In the 53rd minute, the Reds were able to get some good interplay toward the box, but Richie Laryea backtracked from a cross and forced a ball to Davies, whose attempt to send the ball into the mixer was easily blocked to spring a Croatian counter.

Milan Borjan makes a save on the other end. Canada's attack is too talented to be forcing play through one player like this.

While Sam Stejskal called for Atiba Hutchinson to possibly get a hook, it looks like Porto regular Stephen Eustáquio and striker Cyle Larin are coming off for the second half. Jonathan Osorio and Ismaël Koné come in. Osorio is a stabilizer in midfield, while Koné will add greater variety to the attack.

Kovacic running the show for Croatia
------------------------------------

![Image 26: CRO](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

We're used to Luka Modric running the show, but Mateo Kovacic has been brilliant.

100 per cent pass accuracy (after 30 passes), more tackles (4), possession won (7), duels won (5) and chances created (2) than any other player on the pitch.
