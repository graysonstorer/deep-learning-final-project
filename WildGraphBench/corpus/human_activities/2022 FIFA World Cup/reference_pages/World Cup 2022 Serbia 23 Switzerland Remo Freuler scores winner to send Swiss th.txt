Switzerland booked their place in the World Cup knockout stages with a 3-2 victory, but only after suffering a huge scare from Serbia in an epic four-goal first-half.

Xherdan Shaqiri gave Switzerland the lead with a deflected shot in the 20th minute but Serbia, who had been the better team, equalised through a trademark Aleksandar Mitrovic header and then sensationally led when Dusan Vlahovic found the bottom corner which momentarily moved them second in Group G.

However, Switzerland hit-back through Breel Embolo in the final minute of a thrilling first-half and regained the lead early in the second period from a wonderful team goal, rounded off by Remo Freuler.

Switzerland resolutely saw out the victory to leave Serbia bottom with only one point although the match was marred by reports of a FIFA announcement inside Stadium 974 which asked fans to stop "discriminatory shouts and gestures".

**Man of the match:**Dusan Tadic

Switzerland set the tone for a dramatic first half by becoming the first side in World Cup history to have three shots in the opening minute as Granit Xhaka twice fired at goal with Embolo denied by goalkeeper Vanja Milinkovic-Savic.

#### Team news:

*   Switzerland goalkeeper Yann Sommer missed out though illness and was replaced by Gregor Kobel. Xherdan Shaqiri returned to the starting line-up.
*   Serbia coach Dragan Stojkovic opted to start two strikers with both Aleksandar Mitrovic and Dusan Vlahovic up front. Vlahovic started his first match after returning to full fitness.

Despite the early scare, Serbia impressed and saw Andrija Zivkovic hit a post with a powerful drive from outside the area yet it was Switzerland who broke the deadlock when Shaqiri's effort found the net via a deflection.

Serbia, though, remained on top and soon Mitrovic drew his side level with a brilliant glancing header from Tadic's perfect cross. Then, just seven minutes later, they were in position to qualify as Vlahovic capitalised on a mistake from Freuler to fire into the bottom corner.

However, there was to be a final twist in the first-half, when Silvan Widmer crossed from the right and Embolo arrived to side-foot home for 2-2.

Things would quickly get worse for Serbia at the start of the second period when Switzerland put together a wonderful move involving Embolo, Shaqiri before Vargas flicked the ball to Freuler, who made up for his earlier error and thumped in the fifth goal of the evening.

Image:Serbia's Filip Kostic and Switzerland's Breel Embolo exchange words as the game becomes heated in the second half 

Serbia never rediscovered their flowing attacking moves of the first half as the game turned bad-tempered, stoking memories of the [controversial clash between the two sides at the 2018 World Cup](https://www.skysports.com/football/news/13958/11416713/granit-xhaka-xherdan-shaqiri-and-stephan-lichtsteiner-avoid-bans-for-double-eagle-celebration). Xhaka was involved in an injury-time melee which helped take Serbia's yellow card count for the match to seven.

### Serbia made 'forbidden' mistakes

**Serbia manager Dragan Stojkovic said:**"When you lose the game, of course we think about (mistakes made by) the defensive line, but we defend and attack as a team.

"We reversed it after 0-1 to make it 2-1, but again we didn't play well defensively. It was so easy for the Swiss to score the second goal, which was really shocking for us. Psychologically, it was very positive for the Swiss.

"These kinds of things at this level of play are forbidden. If you repeat these mistakes, it is very difficult to win. In the future we must work hard and do everything to resolve the problem.

"We came here with a lot of niggles and injuries to our key players. This was very difficult to manage, it was difficult to have a high level of performance at a World Cup. Of course there was a period over the last one and-a-half-years where we had a success streak but now we faced a dip (in form).

"It goes without saying that we had problems in defence, but this would have to undergo a deeper analysis. I shook the players' hands and said they must keep their heads up. They really did their best and gave their maximum."

### Opta stats: Serbia vs Switzerland turns nasty

*   Serbia have failed to progress from the group stage in each of their four World Cup tournaments (2006, 2010, 2018 and 2022), while this was the first time they failed to win any of their group stage games (D1 L2) since their first appearance in the tournament in 2006 (L3).
*   Along with the reigning World Cup champions France, Switzerland are the only other European team to have qualified for the knockout stages in each of the last five major tournaments since 2014 (World Cups and Euros).
*   11 yellow cards were shown in this game between Serbia (7) and Switzerland (4); the most in a World Cup match since the 2010 final played between Spain and Netherlands (12).
*   Aleksandar Mitrovic has scored 16 goals in his last 18 appearances for Serbia, more than any other player for his national side since the start of 2021. Including his one in this match, nine of these 16 goals have been scored with headers.
