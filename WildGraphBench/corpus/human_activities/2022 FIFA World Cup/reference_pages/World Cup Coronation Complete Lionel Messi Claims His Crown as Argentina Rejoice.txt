LUSAIL, Qatar — Lionel Messi had to wait, and wait, and wait. He had to wait until he was reaching the sunset of his glittering, glorious career. He had to wait until he had already tasted the sting of defeat in a World Cup final. He had to wait even after he seemed to have inspired Argentina’s soccer team to beat France in this year’s final on Sunday, first in regulation time, then again in extra time.

He had to wait until after he scored two goals — but Kylian Mbappé of France, his heir apparent on the world stage, had gotten three, becoming the first man to score a hat trick in a World Cup final in more than half a century. Regulation time ended 2-2; extra time ended, 3-3; and then there were penalties, which Argentina won, 4-2, the last twist in the most extraordinary final in this tournament’s long history.

Only then did Messi’s wait, his agony, come to an end. Only then could he finally claim the one prize that had eluded him, the one honor he craved above all others, the one achievement that could further cement his status as the greatest player to have played the game: delivering a World Cup championship to Argentina, its third overall but first since 1986.

A wild, raw energy had swirled around Argentina throughout this tournament. It coursed through the streets of Doha, packed with tens of thousands of Argentine fans for the last month. It washed down from the stands during each of the country’s seven games here, a pulsating, urgent electricity.

The players detected it, too, their euphoria after every victory just a little more intense, just a little more desperate, the pressure of not only ending Argentina’s 36-year wait for a third World Cup but ensuring Messi’s career apotheosis driving them on and perhaps weighing them down in equal measure. The 35-year-old Messi had said this would be his last World Cup, his last chance to experience a joy that he and many of the fans had not felt in their lifetimes.

Everything Argentina did in Qatar was to an extreme. Its loss to Saudi Arabia plunged the team into despair. Each of its subsequent victories unleashed a fervent, unrestrained exhilaration.

Sunday night had teased deliverance. With only a little more than 10 minutes to play, Argentina stood on the cusp. Coach Lionel Scaloni’s team had shouldered the weight of history, the weight of expectation, admirably lightly.

Argentina had not so much as quieted Mbappé as silenced him. It had gone ahead, 1-0, in the 23rd minute, when Ángel Di María was fouled and Messi put in the penalty kick. Argentina flexed its muscle in the 36th minute with one of the most sumptuous goals the World Cup final has seen, a flowing move orchestrated by Alexis Mac Allister and finished by Di María but hinging on a pass that was a moment of characteristic Messi alchemy, a silken touch that turned the most base material into something golden.

For all that time, the 2-0 lead looked like smooth sailing; Argentina should have known it would not work like that. In the space of two minutes late in the second half, France wiped out Argentina’s advantage, all of its painstaking work crumbling in the blink of an eye: another penalty, this one converted by Mbappé in the 80th minute, followed almost immediately by a fierce volley, again by Mbappé.

Argentina’s players slumped, the breath drawn out of their lungs. They had been so close. In an instant it was 2-2; they were as far as ever.

France smelled blood; Argentina could do nothing but hang on for extra time. Messi roused himself again, driving the ball home in the 108th minute after goalkeeper Hugo Lloris made a save on Lautaro Martínez.

Once more, Messi was swamped by delirious teammates. Once more, he stood in front of Argentina’s fans, pumping his arms, an idol and his worshipers. And once more, Mbappé would not be denied, would not accept a cameo role in someone else’s story. His shot struck the outstretched arm of Argentina’s Gonzalo Montiel. Mbappé drilled home the penalty. The game would go the distance, to the sweet cruelty of penalties.

There, for once, it would not be Messi — or Mbappé — who delivered the decisive blow. They both scored. But no matter how teams try to manipulate the order, to direct destiny, penalty shootouts are, invariably, a place for unlikely heroes and unfortunate villains. Kingsley Coman and Aurélien Tchouaméni missed for France, leaving Montiel, an unheralded right back, standing with his country, and Messi’s legacy, on his shoulders.

The noise that Argentina’s fans emitted when the ball struck the net seemed to pierce the sky. Messi’s wait, at last, was over.

In the moments after he had arrived at what he has always seen as both his destiny and his duty, though, Messi seemed improbably, blissfully calm. As his teammates ran to one another, to the massed bank of Argentina’s fans behind the goal in which the final, crucial blow had been delivered, most of them could bear it no longer.

For most, all of that hope, all of that belief, all of that fear broke at once. Di María’s face was stained with tears, his chest heaving as he tried to catch his breath. Messi, on the other hand, simply smiled, a brow briefly furrowing in a manner familiar to any harried parent as he tried to work out how his wife, Antonela Roccuzzo, might bring their three children onto the field.

It was only when he embraced his mother a few minutes later that he could maintain his composure no longer, when he finally allowed his joy, his relief, to sweep him away. Messi might have learned long ago that it would not be easy to emulate Diego Maradona, to turn Argentina into a world champion; he could not, surely, have imagined it would be quite this hard.

Now it was done. He congratulated his teammates. He joined them, arms slung over their shoulders, as they danced and bounced with their fans. He found his family, clasped them tight.

And then he was summoned to the stage that had been erected in the middle of the field. FIFA likes to draw these things out; before the World Cup trophy is presented, it must run through the young player of the tournament, the top goalkeeper, the leading scorer, the best player. That final prize went, of course, to Messi. This World Cup was about him. It has always been about him.

He collected his best-player statue from Gianni Infantino, FIFA’s president; shook hands with the assembled dignitaries; and walked off down the podium. The trophy he cared about was sitting there, golden and gleaming, in his sight.

There were a few minutes, yet, before he would have a medal placed around his neck, a ceremonial bisht draped over his shoulders, and the chance to hoist the trophy into the air. It was an hour or so before he would be carried around the field on his teammates’ shoulders, a vast crowd of staff members and partners and children in their wake, a homage to Maradona’s celebrations in 1986, the last time Argentina was champion of the world.

He still had all of that to come. He would have his moment, soon enough. But now he stopped next to the trophy. He looked at it. And then he leaned down, ever so slightly, caressed its smooth dome, and kissed it, once, twice. Messi had waited long enough. He did not want to wait any longer.

BUENOS AIRES — After 36 years, the parade couldn’t wait.

Half a world away, Argentina’s beloved men’s national team hoisted its third World Cup trophy. And the nation began to march.

In a sort of euphoric procession that played out across the country, millions of Argentines paraded to central squares and monuments in cities and towns, large and small. In Rosario, the hometown of their World Cup hero, Lionel Messi, they marched to the Flag Monument. And here in the capital, Buenos Aires, fans streamed down broad avenues that all pointed to the city’s effective center — a large plaza centered around a 235-foot-tall monument known simply as the Obelisk.

“It is our pilgrimage,” said Elsa Diaz, 70, a handywoman draped in an Argentine flag, making the same walk she made in 1978 when Argentina won its first World Cup, but this time with her 32-year-old daughter. “We are all going to the Obelisk. It is our monument, and the center of Argentina.”

In a country where soccer is religion, this was among the holiest of Sundays. And so when Gonzalo Montiel’s penalty kick hit the back of the net — vanquishing France, ending a World Cup final for the ages and bringing the championship back to this soccer-obsessed country for the first time since 1986 — Argentina was plunged into a sort of rapture.

Strangers hugged. Friends kissed. Grown men wept. And everyone shrieked. “Argentina, mi amor!” one man yelled during extra time, tears streaming down his face. “Argentina, my love!”

“Emotion, joy — and a release,” said Federico Polo, 19, right after the victory.

Thousands had gathered in Centenario Park in western Buenos Aires to watch the game on a large screen set up by the city. After the match, everyone had the same idea: Head to the Obelisk.

But the roads were jammed, the metro was shut down and the city buses were parked. So they walked.

“The entirety of Argentina is on this avenue right now,” said Sergio Gutierrez, 46, a drugstore worker banging a drum, who walked with his wife and three children down Corrientes Avenue, a famed thoroughfare closely associated with the tango for the many theaters and dance halls that line the way. “We will walk until we can’t get any farther.”

The walk from the park would take 70 minutes, according to Google Maps, but the avenue was jammed, the pace was slow, and there were plenty of distractions along the way.

Every woman who looked to be of grandmother age was serenaded with a chant that has become a rallying cry of this year’s World Cup in Argentina: “Abuela, la, la, la, la, la.” The chant, of the Spanish word for grandmother, began in Buenos Aires after one of Argentina’s victories, when a group of young men sang it to a dancing older woman who wore a medical mask and wrapped herself in a flag.

“She still doesn’t know why everyone is singing to her but she loves it,” said Silvia Belvedere of her 89-year-old mother, Nelida Peralta, who was standing on the sidewalk along the procession, gripping a cane and waving two small Argentina flags. As the procession passed, each group that noticed her stopped to serenade her and take photos.

“I’m so happy,” Ms. Peralta said. “I can’t go there, so I’m staying here waving the flag.”

Farther down the avenue, a group of Bangladeshi immigrants were greeted warmly by the marching fans. Bangladesh’s [love for Argentina’s national soccer team](https://web.archive.org/web/20230824211729/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/08/sports/world-cup/india-brazil-argentina-fans.html) has become a major storyline here, and so Argentines parading down the route stopped for photos and high fives. One of the men from Bangladesh, who said he had lived in Buenos Aires for 24 years, said he had never felt more connected to his adopted home.

Along the route, Argentines expressed their joy with whatever was at hand. Cars stuck at intersections watching the procession beeped incessantly; one man banged a pan with a spoon. And over and over again, the crowd sang [this year’s anthem of the Argentina national team](https://web.archive.org/web/20230824211729/https:/www.nytimes.com/live/2022/12/18/sports/argentina-france-world-cup-final-score#argentina-song-muchachos), “Muchachos, Ahora Nos Volvimos A Ilusionar” — or “Guys, Now We’re Getting Excited Again.”

The song has become a sort of celebratory hymn in Argentina over the past several weeks, and it speaks of Argentina’s late soccer star, Diego Maradona, a sort of deity in this country, looking down from the sky to help Messi and his teammates bring Argentina another World Cup. After the song’s prediction came to fruition on Sunday, it was the soundtrack of the march.

As the Obelisk came into view, the crowd thickened. A city bus that had been abandoned in the middle of the street had more than a dozen revelers dancing atop it. Elsewhere, men hung from light poles, and people climbed to the roof of a restaurant via a ladder that created a sort of bridge between the restaurant and the top of a newsstand.

Some people had already been to the Obelisk and were heading the other way, their pilgrimage complete. A man with his face and chest painted blue and white looked drained. “My throat hurts from screaming,” said Pedro Humberto Aguilar, 51, behind blue-tinted shades.

The procession ended at Republic Plaza, a sea of celebration in every direction. Every avenue leading to the plaza was clogged with revelers. From above, the plaza was an expanse of humanity, hundreds of thousands of people, interspersed with waving flags and occasional fireworks.

Through the rapturous cacophony, the anthem could be made out here and there.

Over and over again, revelers belted out the lyrics, which try to convey Argentina’s intense love for its soccer team.

“I can’t explain it to you,” they sang, “because you won’t understand.”

DOHA, Qatar — In the end, Qatar got what it wanted.

The tiny desert state, a thumb-shaped peninsula, craved nothing more than to be better known, to be a player on the world stage, when in 2009 it launched what seemed like an improbable bid to stage the men’s soccer World Cup, the most popular sporting event on earth. Hosting the tournament has cost more than anyone could have imagined — in treasure, in time, in lives.

But on Sunday night, as the fireworks filled the sky above Lusail, as the Argentina fans sang and their star, Lionel Messi, beamed while clasping a trophy he had waited a lifetime to touch, everyone knew Qatar.

The spectacular denouement — a dream final pitting Argentina against France; a first World Cup title for Messi, the world’s best player; a pulsating match settled after six goals and a penalty shootout — made sure of that. And as if to make sure, to put the nation’s final imprint on the first World Cup in the Middle East, Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, stopped a beaming Messi as he made his way to collect the biggest trophy in the sport and pulled him back. There was one more thing that needed to be done.

He pulled out a golden fringed bisht, the black cloak worn in the Gulf for special occasions, and wrapped it around Messi’s shoulders before handing over the 18-karat gold trophy.

The celebration ended a tumultuous decade for a tournament awarded in a bribery scandal; stained by claims of human rights abuses and the deaths and injuries suffered by the migrant workers hired to build Qatar’s $200 billion World Cup; and shadowed by controversial decisions on everything from alcohol to armbands.

Yet for one month Qatar has been the center of the world, pulling off a feat none of its neighbors in the Arab world had managed to achieve, one that at times had seemed unthinkable in the years since Sepp Blatter, the former FIFA president, made the stunning announcement inside a Zurich conference hall on Dec. 2, 2010, that Qatar would host the 2022 World Cup.

It is improbable the sport will see such an unlikely host again soon. Qatar was perhaps among the most ill-suited hosts for a tournament of the scale of the World Cup, a country so lacking in stadiums and infrastructure and history that its bid was labeled “high risk” by FIFA’s own evaluators. But it took advantage of the one commodity it had in plentiful supply: money.

Backed by seemingly bottomless financial resources to fuel its ambitions, Qatar embarked on a project that required nothing less than the building, or rebuilding, of its entire country in service to a monthlong soccer tournament. Those billions were spent within its borders — seven new stadiums were constructed and other major infrastructure projects were completed at enormous financial and human cost. But when that was not enough, it spent lavishly outside its boundaries, too, acquiring sports teams and sports rights worth billions of dollars, and hiring sports stars and celebrities to support its cause.

And all that was on display Sunday. By the time the final game was played in the $1 billion Lusail Stadium, Qatar could not lose. The game was being shown across the Middle East on beIN Sports, a sports broadcasting behemoth set up in the aftermath of Qatar’s winning the World Cup hosting rights. It also could lay claim to the two best players on the field, Argentina’s Messi and the French star Kylian Mbappé, both of whom are under contract to the Qatar-owned French club Paris St.-Germain.

Mbappé, who had scored the first hat trick in a final in over a half-century, finished the game sitting on the grass, consoled by President Emmanuel Macron of France, an invited guest of the emir, as Argentina’s players danced in celebration all around him.

The competition delivered compelling — and sometimes troubling — story lines from the outset, with the intensely political opening at Al Bayt Stadium, an enormous venue designed to look like a Bedouin tent. That night, Qatar’s emir had sat side by side with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, less than three years after the latter had led a punishing [blockade of Qatar](https://web.archive.org/web/20230824211729/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/world/middleeast/gulf-qatar-blockade.html).

For a month, deals were discussed and alliances were made. Qatar’s team was not a factor in its World Cup debut; it lost all three of its games, exiting the competition with the worst performance of any host in the competition’s history.

There would also be other challenges, some of Qatar’s own making, like a sudden prohibition on the sale of alcohol within the stadium perimeters only two days before that first game — a last-minute decision that left Budweiser, a longtime sponsor of soccer’s world governing body, FIFA, to fume on the sideline.

On the tournament’s second day, FIFA crushed a campaign by a group of European teams to wear an armband to promote inclusivity, part of efforts promised to campaign groups and critics in their home countries, and then Qatar quashed efforts by Iranian fans to highlight ongoing protests in their country.

But on the field, the competition delivered. There were great goals and great games, stunning upsets and an abundance of surprising score lines that created new heroes, most notably in the Arab world.

First came Saudi Arabia, which can now lay claim to having beaten the World Cup champion in the group stage. Morocco, which had only once reached the knockout stage, became the first African team to advance to the semifinals, pulling off a succession of barely believable victories over European soccer heavyweights: Belgium, Spain and then Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal.

Those results sparked celebration across the Arab world and in a handful of major European capitals, while also providing a platform for fans in Qatar to promote the Palestinian cause, the one intrusion of politics that Qatari officials did nothing to discourage.

In the stands, the backdrop was a curious one, with several games appearing short of supporters and then mysteriously filling up in the minutes after kickoff, when gates were opened to grant spectators — many of them the South Asian migrants — entry free of charge. The true number of paying spectators is unlikely to ever be known, their empty seats filled by thousands of the same laborers and migrants who had built the stadium and the country, and who kept it running during the World Cup.

That group, largely drawn from countries like India, Bangladesh and Nepal, was the most visible face of Qatar to the estimated one million visitors who traveled to the tournament. They worked as volunteers at stadiums, served the food and manned the metro stations, buffed the marble floors and shined the hand rails and door knobs at the scores of newly built hotels and apartment complexes.

By the end of the tournament, most of those fans had gone, leaving the Argentines — an estimated temporary population of 40,000 — to provide the sonic backdrop to the final game. Dressed in sky blue and white stripes, they converged on the Lusail Stadium, creating the type of authentic World Cup atmosphere — bouncing and singing throughout 120 minutes of play, and then long afterward — that no amount of Qatari wealth could buy.

They had gotten exactly what they wanted from the World Cup. And so did Qatar.

LUSAIL, Qatar — The president of France waited patiently on the grass, but Kylian Mbappé was not ready to be consoled. Not yet.

He had done all he could on Sunday to avoid this moment. There was the first penalty kick, the one that shook France out of its torpor, that gave it a lifeline in a World Cup final it was losing. There was the stunning goal that followed just over a minute later, the one that had let Mbappé, had let France, think that the golden trophy sitting on a plinth near the tunnel, the one he had lifted four years ago, was still there to be won.

The rest seemed to play out in fast motion. Lionel Messi of Argentina scored another goal in extra time to give his team the lead. Mbappé scored in response. When the tie could not be broken, Mbappé scored to open the penalty shootout. Messi followed and did the same. Then came two France misses, three Argentina makes and it was over.

That was how Mbappé found himself sitting on the grass near the midfield stripe wondering how it could have all gone so wrong, then so right, and then so painfully, so permanently wrong. It would take a moment to process that. The president would have to wait.

“Kylian has really left his mark on this final,” Mbappé’s coach, Didier Deschamps, said. “Unfortunately, he didn’t leave it in the way he would have liked. That’s why he was so disappointed at the end of the night.”

The story of Sunday’s World Cup final, arguably the best in the tournament’s history, was always going to be about Messi’s quest for the one title that had eluded him in his career. But Mbappé had come to Lusail with history and victory in his sights, too. He had his own story to write.

Mbappé had already experienced the feeling of winning the World Cup. In 2018, he and France lifted the trophy in Moscow, where Mbappé had become the first teenager since Pelé to score in the final. On Sunday, he was hoping to match Pelé again and make France the first country to retain the trophy since Pelé’s Brazil in 1962.

He had already done Pelé one better before the game went to penalty kicks: Not even the Brazilian great had ever scored a hat trick in a World Cup final. Mbappé’s was the first since 1966.

Mbappé, 23, will have known that. He is not just one of the world’s best players. He is also a student of the game and its history and its stars. For months he had been targeting Qatar as the moment, and the place, where he closed the gap with Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo in the debate over the best player in the game.

In an interview with The New York Times this summer, he was quick to recall the number of times each of his rivals had been named world player of the year. He knew he already had something on his résumé that they did not — a World Cup title — and he knew that a second in a row would be a feat even they could never match.

“I always say I dream about everything,” [Mbappé said](https://web.archive.org/web/20230824211729/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/06/sports/soccer/kylian-mbappe-champions-league-psg.html) at the time. “I have no limits. So of course, like you say, it’s a new generation. And Ronaldo, Messi — you’re gonna stop. We have to find someone else, someone new.”

Mbappé thought that he was that someone else. His performance on Sunday made it seem more like a prediction than a boast: a penalty kick coolly dispatched in the 80th minute, after his teammate Randal Kolo Muani was knocked down from behind in the box; a second goal just over a minute later, a sliding right-footed finish after a give-and-go with Marcus Thuram at the top of the area; and a second penalty three minutes before the end of extra time, after Messi, for the second time, had given Argentina the lead and the momentum.

“They managed to get us back in the match, to keep the dream alive,” Deschamps said. “Unfortunately, we couldn’t achieve the dream.”

The penalties finished the game and the story. Mbappé eventually rose from the grass, lifted by a hand from Argentina’s goalkeeper, Emiliano Martínez, and eventually took a moment to share an embrace, and a few words, with the French president, Emmanuel Macron. But even his moment of personal triumph seemed cruel.

His three goals gave him eight for the tournament, edging Messi by one for the Golden Boot as the World Cup’s top scorer. But it also meant he had to walk onstage three times: first to collect the award, then to return to pose for photos and then a third time to receive his silver medal.

Each time, he made the long walk across the curling white stage. Each time, he passed the golden World Cup trophy. Each time, it was close enough to touch.

On Sunday, it was there for the taking. He will have to wait four years to get that close again.

PARIS — The temperature was freezing out on the streets of Paris but tropical inside the packed bars, where crazed fans of “Les Bleus” hopped up and down, embraced one another, pounded on the walls, and burst into the national anthem as their team made a remarkable comeback and seemed poised to claim a second straight World Cup.

Twice France rallied to tie the match, including in the 118th minute, before losing on penalty kicks. And by then rain was falling outside the once-boisterous bars, in keeping with the national sentiment. For the first time since the World Cup began, the streets did not echo with honking after a match and the grand, decorated Champs-Élysées did not throb shoulder-to-shoulder with revelers.

“It’s just terrible,” said Maximilien Bago, a 23-year-old business student, who moments before had been bouncing exuberantly in a wig-like hat matching the national colors. The eyes of the fans around him swelled with tears. “But that’s soccer,” he said.

President Emmanuel Macron of France, a soccer fan who was in Qatar to watch the match, waded onto the field to console Kylian Mbappé, the star forward who scored three goals, including two in quick succession that turned what looked like a rout for Argentina into one of the most dramatic matches in World Cup history.

“We were so close,” Mr. Macron told reporters, adding that the team had “made us incredibly proud.”

“We are a great soccer nation, we are also a great nation,” said the president. “What this game tells us is that nothing is ever a foregone conclusion.”

Many French cities had chosen not to put up screens or create fan zones, in protest of the environmental and ethical record of the tournament’s host, Qatar, even before the energy crisis sparked by the war in Ukraine put France and the rest of Europe into power-saving mode.

Instead, many fans jammed into bars and friends’ apartments to watch the game.

“This match was eternal, exceptional, historic,” said Matthieu Couranjou, 52, a telecoms engineer at the French Culture Ministry who welcomed friends to his apartment in the Bastille neighborhood. Eruptions of joy after Mbappé’s third goal tied the match gave way to stunned silence after France lost in penalty kicks. “We went down fighting.”

In Grenoble, a large city in southern France, supporters with French flags draped over their shoulders and painted on their faces pressed against the windows of packed pubs to watch the game. Small fireworks were fired as people climbed trees, stood on tables or climbed on friends’ shoulders.

The mood of the crowd there — and across the country — ebbed and flowed with their team’s fortunes, from silence as France fell behind 2-0, to raucous cheers during their comeback, to silence again with a 3-2 deficit in extra time, to cheering again when Mbappé tied the match again. At last came deafening silence as France fell on penalty kicks.

“It’s too bad,” said 19-year-old Aurélien Delavay, who looked lost, his hands buried in his pockets, his face down. “We would have made history,” he added, referring to France’s chance to become the first team in a half-century to retain its World Cup title.

“But Argentina also deserved this victory,” he added. “Bravo to them.”

Reporting from Buenos Aires

After the intense celebrations here, the crowd at Centenario Park in west Buenos Aires has been standing together, mostly quiet, watching the trophies be awarded. A sea of faces, smiling, relieved, elated. Kids on shoulders, adults in trees, a large group hanging on a fence for a view. Watching Messi get handed the trophy, Federico Polo, 19, said, “It’s the closure we all needed.”

Here comes the sound. Messi follows Scaloni onto the stage and gets hugs from the royalty, soccer and otherwise, and now waits by the trophy for Infantino and the emir. The emir puts an Arab robe over his shoulders, and Messi is rubbing his hands together now. He wants the trophy. Infantino holds it just a beat too long, of course, but Messi has it now, rubbing its top like the head of a new baby.

Mbappé, with his hat trick, beats Messi to the Golden Boot as top scorer by one. He looks shattered to have to go get the award though. Messi is next: The worst-kept secret in Qatar is that he is the winner of the Golden Ball as the tournament’s best player. Shaking hands he has to walk down the stage for photos; halfway there he passes the World Cup trophy on its stand and he can’t resist: He stops and gives it a long kiss.

Spare a thought for Kylian Mbappé, the first man since 1966 to score three goals in a World Cup final. That type of performance would usually end with a winner’s medal, not a sickening loss. Mbappé was prone on the turf with Argentine celebrations taking place all around him. He finally emerged, given a hand by President Emmanuel Macron, who took to the field to console the deposed champions. It was Macron who this summer convinced Mbappé to spurn the advances of Real Madrid and commit to a new contract with P.S.G., France’s standard bearer club.

The temperature had gone from freezing on the streets to tropical inside the packed bars of Paris, with crazed French fans hopping up and down, hugging one another, pounding on the walls and bursting into the national anthem, time and time again. But by the end of the match, when France lost in penalty kicks, rain was falling in Paris to match the national sentiment.

“It’s just terrible,” said Maximilien Bago, a 23-year-old business student, pulling his hairy tri-colored hat off as the eyes of men and women around him swelled with tears. “But that’s soccer.”

Messi is addressing the crowd now. I won’t translate because it sounded a little blue. But let’s just say he’s pleased, and the language will only endear him further to his country. Messi has had a complicated relationship with Argentina, which he left at 13 to seek fame and fortune (and life-changing hormone treatments) in Barcelona. But that has changed in the last month. He has stayed true to himself, and his country has fallen hard for him. With Diego Maradona gone since 2020, he will surely assume his mantle now. He’s earned it for sure.

OK, now he’s crying. Messi’s family and friends — like his former teammate Sergio Agüero — are around him now and that appears to have pushed his emotions over the edge. He wipes away a quick tear — maybe it’s finally hitting him what has happened here, what it all means — but that’s it. Within a minute he is with his current teammates again, in front of their fans, bouncing as they sing.

Remarkable scenes here in Lusail after that last penalty delivered Argentina’s victory. This has a strong claim to be the best World Cup final ever. Lionel Messi is embraced by almost every one of his teammates as he gets the one title to elude him — and that’s the most important title of them all. Almost every one of those teammates that embraced Messi was in floods of tears. Even his mother was, but not Messi. He wore a smile of relief and joy, of a chapter finally closed.

Argentina has claimed its third World Cup title with its victory in the penalty shootout against France, capping an extraordinary final that saw it take a two-goal lead, give it away in a blur, seize it back in extra time and then surrender it again. It was never going to be easy for Messi but here he is: A World Cup champion at 35, a man with no boxes left to tick in his career, a player who can rightly claim his place in the argument as the best of all time.

120′ Mbappé plays provider for a change with a loooooooong cross from the left wing. It is an inch or two too far for Kolo Muani near the spot, though, and while Martinez gave everyone a scare by diving for it, the ball was always going wide.

Even Argentina could not have imagined that the first half of the World Cup final would go quite that well.

Argentina has a 2-0 lead and appears on the cusp of its first World Cup championship in more than a generation after a first half that ticked pretty much every box.

Lionel Messi scored the opening goal, after Ángel Di María won what was admittedly an extremely soft penalty, and then set in motion another — a flowing attack finished by Di María that will go down as a bona fide classic World Cup goal.

Argentina has kept Kylian Mbappé not just quiet but essentially silent. It has forced Didier Deschamps, the French coach, into a double substitution before halftime, which can be simultaneously regarded as bold, decisive action, a commendable decision that he had got his setup for the game wrong, and a form of blind panic.

France carries enough of a threat, though, for Argentina to be at least a little wary of what happens from here on. It has just 45 minutes to hold on to win the World Cup for a third time, to give Messi the crowning glory of his career. But those 45 minutes are likely to feature wave after wave of French attacks, led by some of the most devastating players on the planet.

The Golden Boot, which goes to the tournament’s top scorer, is the biggest of the secondary prizes on the line today.

Argentina’s Lionel Messi and France’s Kylian Mbappé lead the standings with five goals each entering the final, and their teammates Julián Álvarez and Olivier Giroud lurk right behind at four apiece.

To be clear, no one wants it if the award doesn’t come as a set with the World Cup trophy. But three of them (Messi in 2014, and Mbappé and Giroud in 2018) are set to start in their second final on Sunday, and all four are likely to have a direct say in their team’s World Cup destiny on Sunday.

BUENOS AIRES — In a country where soccer is religion, there is no holier Sunday than when Argentina plays in a World Cup final.

Here in Buenos Aires, the displays of devotion are not solemn. In the early hours of Sunday morning, revelers were still dancing in the street to this year’s [World Cup anthem](https://web.archive.org/web/20230824211729/https:/www.nytimes.com/live/2022/12/18/sports/argentina-france-world-cup-final-score#argentina-song-muchachos) — an earworm that speaks of the soccer great Diego Maradona looking down from the sky. Before 9 a.m., cars were honking, announcing the arrival of something just about everyone here is already talking about.

The weather for game day? High 70s. Hardly a cloud in the sky.

The energy has been palpable all week in Argentina. Streets are adorned with blue-and-white flags, Argentines are wearing blue-and-white jerseys and that World Cup anthem is on repeat.

Argentina’s love for soccer can be difficult to overstate. On Tuesday, during the semifinal match against Croatia, a man was arrested just west of Buenos Aires for hijacking a city bus. The driver had stopped to buy something at a store, according to a police report. The man, worried he would miss the game, hopped into the seat and started driving. (He ended up spending the game in jail.)

Argentina’s love for soccer has long been represented in an idolization of one man: Maradona. Beyond being regarded as perhaps the world’s best soccer player and having won the nation its last World Cup title in 1986, Maradona also had a romantic rags-to-riches story of a boy who grew from playing on the dirt fields of a Buenos Aires slum to dominating at the top of the soccer world.

Now there is another Argentine who appears to be taking his place alongside Maradona. Lionel Messi is also in the conversation for being the game’s best player, but his personal journey has been less intriguing to Argentines. At 13, he left the country for Spain to train and never lived there again.

But now, in his final World Cup after an already stellar career, he is on the verge of bringing Argentina its third World Cup two years after Maradona’s death.

If he pulls it off, Argentines might see the tale not just as a storybook ending, but perhaps as a biblical one.

Lionel Messi apart, arguably nobody has played a more prominent role in Argentina’s run to the World Cup final than a 62-year-old musician and a 30-year-old teacher, neither of whom is anywhere near Qatar. Between them, though, they created the song that has become the soundtrack to Argentina’s games and an earworm contracted by anyone who has been in Doha over the last month, or watched any of the tournament on television.

The song, Muchachos, Ahora Nos Volvimos A Ilusionar, has been adopted as an unofficial anthem not only by Argentina’s vast army of traveling fans — around 40,000 are expected to attend the final at Lusail today — but by the players themselves: Instagram videos of their dressing room celebrations after every victory have invariably featured a joyous rendition of the song.

Its popularity, doubtless, has something to do with the fact that its two verses hit all the major notes of Argentina’s campaign: it is a homage not only to Messi but to Diego Maradona; it pays tribute to the Argentine soldiers who died during the Falklands War of 1982; it draws in the country’s various disappointments in international tournaments in recent years; and it goes into its key change with a taunt directed at Argentina’s major soccer rival, Brazil.

But it is also a familiar tune to most Argentine fans. Various Argentine club teams have their own bespoke versions of Muchachos, Esta Noche Me Emborracho, a 2003 hit for the rock band La Mosca Tsé tsé, led by the 62-year-old singer Guillermo Novellis. A (relatively) cursory attempt to trace its genealogy would suggest that fans of Boca Juniors were the first to adapt the melody for their own purposes, in this case mocking its fierce rival, River Plate. Within a couple of years, Racing Club, a team in Avellaneda, had an interpretation, quickly followed by its rival, Independiente. In the endless round of call and response that marks Argentine fan culture, both were dedicated to denigrating the other. The most famous iteration, though, probably belonged to River Plate.

That it became something approaching a national anthem is down, largely, to a 30-year-old teacher named Fernando Romero. Together with a friend, he changed the lyrics once more in the days after Maradona’s death last year, turning it into a tribute to the player widely regarded as either Argentina’s first or second greatest. When the two friends were filmed singing it outside River’s Monumental stadium, during a game against Bolivia, the footage quickly went viral. Messi became aware of it: he named it, soon after, his favorite soccer chant. So, too, did Novellis, who got in touch with Romero and volunteered to record and release a version with his lyrics in the buildup to the World Cup.

Even Novellis, though, is a little surprised by its success. La Mosca has a curiously fitting relationship with soccer. Maradona was such a fan that he invited the band to play his 40th birthday party in 2000. And seven years later, another devotee asked if they would do a turn at his 20th birthday party. Messi and Novellis have been in occasional contact ever since.

Now, the song has not only reverberated around Lusail, again and again, on Argentina’s way to the final, it is currently number one on Spotify in Argentina. It has been streamed 4.4 million times in just a few weeks. (The original is currently at almost 14 million.) Novellis has been interviewed by media outlets across the world; a campaign was launched to fly Romero to Qatar, though he turned it down, suggesting the country had “more important things to address.” The story, as Novellis told La Nacion, is “easy to explain, but difficult to understand.”

Argentina Coach Lionel Scaloni has made only one change to his lineup for the final: Ángel Di María, a veteran and a close friend of Lionel Messi, will replace Leandro Paredes in midfield.

France appears to have overcome a brush with illness to start its first-choice team. Dayot Upamecano is back in central defense, and Adrien Rabiot returns in midfield. Both had missed the semifinal victory against Morocco with what the team said was a virus.

**Argentina’s lineup:**

Emiliano Martínez; Nicolás Tagliafico, Nicolás Otamendi, Cristian Romero, Nahuel Molina; Rodrigo De Paul, Alexis Mac Allister, Enzo Fernández, Ángel Di María; Julián Álvarez, Lionel Messi (c)

**France’s lineup:**

Hugo Lloris (c); Jules Koundé, Raphael Varane, Dayot Upamecano, Théo Hernandez; Aurélien Tchouaméni, Adrien Rabiot, Antoine Griezmann; Ousmane Démbelé, Olivier Giroud, Kylian Mbappé.

France’s road to the final already had been dogged by injuries (its best striker, Karim Benzema, pulled out after arriving in Qatar, and left back Lucas Hernandez went out early and never returned) before sickness threatened to derail its title challenge.

“It’s flu season, and in that sense, we have to be careful,” Coach Didier Deschamps had said earlier this week. “And also, the players have put in a huge shift and their immune system might be a little run down.”

But then three more players — defenders Raphaël Varane and Ibrahima Konaté and forward Kingsley Coman — missed training on Friday. Deschamps, though, has shrugged it all off. Of the virus sweeping through his team, he said, “We’re not worried, really.”

Maybe he isn’t. The fitness of the returnees will be worth watching, though.

Szymon Marciniak, a Polish referee who had to step away from soccer after learning he had a potentially dangerous heart condition, will oversee Sunday’s World Cup final between Argentina and France.

Marciniak, 41, told reporters in Doha that he had to stop refereeing last year after learning he had tachycardia, a condition in which the heart rate increases to more than 100 beats per minute.

“I had a very difficult time for the last year and a half,” Marciniak said. His diagnosis forced him to miss the last European Championship, which he called “a terrible feeling,” but said that now “I cannot even stop smiling because it’s a great feeling.”

Marciniak has already refereed games involving both finalists: He was in charge when France beat Denmark in the group stage, and again for Argentina’s victory over Australia in the round of 16.

He will lead an all-Polish crew of linesman in the final, though the fourth official will be an American, Ismael Elfath. Another Pole, Tomasz Kwiatkowski, will serve as the video assistant referee.

Only five red cards have ever been shown in a World Cup final, but two of those went to Argentines (Pedro Monzón and Gustavo Dezotti, both in the 1990 final) and two others went to Frenchmen (Marcel Desailly in 1998 and Zinedine Zidane, for his infamous head butt against Italy in 2006).

There have been only five red cards at this World Cup, and two of those were shown after play had ended. The only players sent off during matches were Wayne Hennessey of Wales, for a violent foul after he charged out of his penalty area against Iran; Vincent Aboubakar of Cameroon, who got his second yellow card and was sent off against Brazil for removing shirt after he scored a late goal; and Walid Cheddira of Morocco, who got two yellows in about two minutes as his team closed out its win over Portugal in the quarterfinals.

The other two reds came after the whistle: to South Korea Coach Paulo Bento, who confronted the referee after a loss to Ghana in the group stage; and to Netherlands defender Denzel Dumfries, who was sent off after his country’s ill-tempered loss to Argentina on penalty kicks in the quarterfinals.

### France vs. Argentina

**How to watch:**_10 a.m. Eastern. Fox, Telemundo._

**After 64 games,** after magnificent goals and stunning defeats and surprises galore, the World Cup concludes today. This matchup feels as if decreed by Gianni Infantino, the sheikhs of Qatar, Fox and Telemundo, and the cadre of FIFA board members who may or may not have accepted bribes.

Argentina. France.

Between them, eight World Cup finals (10 once this game starts). Two championships each.

Lionel Messi. Kylian Mbappé.

The best of all time against the best of this time, both employed by Paris St.-Germain … which just happens to be owned by Qatar.

France can become the first nation since Brazil, in 1958 and 1962, to win consecutive titles. That’s Péle territory. Argentina, meantime, can become the first nation to spontaneously combust before it can host a victory parade. It would vanish, cease to exist, leaving a crater the approximate shape of Messi’s profile.

This is not the World Cup of Messi because it will be his last, which he confirmed the other night, but because he has defied age, opposition and unfathomable pressure to lead his homeland to the final match.

Five goals, three assists, many spun out of nothing but imagination and faith. These moments — [like his preposterous dribbling demonstration against Croatia](https://web.archive.org/web/20230824211729/https://twitter.com/ConnorKalopsis/status/1602764555310047235?s=20&t=yofnnsXb2He-K1s-ESWzTA), or his [mind-melting pass against the Netherlands](https://web.archive.org/web/20230824211729/https://twitter.com/Akhlash_lm10/status/1602579633068806145?s=20&t=yofnnsXb2He-K1s-ESWzTA) — just appear. And they have appeared in every match, at critical junctures, yoking Argentina to the precipice of forever.

That France achieved this stage despite lengthy lapses in the knockout rounds indicates a worrisome susceptibility to loose and passive stretches. Or, perhaps, that Les Bleus — even with Mbappé dazzling and Antoine Griezmann creating and Olivier Giroud prowling — have yet to crackle with full intensity. And, if (when?) that happens, oooooooohhhhh boy.

This is the last World Cup for so many, and of so much: for Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, Luka Modric and Dani Alves, for a tournament that will expand to 48 nations for 2026. And this final, then, oozing with soccer royalty, is a fitting send-off for a glorious, complicated spectacle conjured in a desert: Either France or Argentina is one victory from immortality, the best kind of permanence.

France’s commitment to proving the unrivaled depth of its resources, at this stage, swept past impressive long ago. It is now skirting the borders of remarkable.

Before the World Cup started, Didier Deschamps, France’s coach, had already lost five players to injury — most of them likely starters. Deschamps did not so much as blink. Here are five more, just like them.

A few days in, a sixth player, Lucas Hernandez, fell by the wayside. Deschamps — a man with an intense, deadpan demeanor that is only slightly undercut by a shy, coquettish laugh — did not even pretend to be flustered. Fine. If that’s how you want to play it, he’ll just go and become the first manager to retain the men’s World Cup in half a century despite being a player down. He did not bother summoning a replacement.

None of it has stopped France’s serene progress to a second successive final, of course. But it is not quite true to say that those absences have not affected Deschamps’s team in Qatar. While the French may have barely broken a sweat on their way to the quarterfinals, they were worried against both England and Morocco. There were, in fact, fairly long stretches of both games when the reigning champion was on the back foot.

France won the World Cup in 2018 without being thrilling; that team gave the impression that it always had another gear. This one, stripped of several key players, has looked just a little like it has reached its edge.

Against Morocco, France had been deprived of two more players: Both Adrien Rabiot and Dayot Upamecano were absent, suffering from a virus. It has been reported in France that the virus was contracted from England’s players during the quarterfinal, although the evidence for that claim is scant, at best. (A respiratory virus has been circulating in Doha all tournament; doctors, generally, have attributed it not to air conditioning, the diagnosis of at least one Brazilian wing, but to the influx of more than a million people to the city.)

Wherever the virus came from, in the days that have followed France’s semifinal, three more players have fallen victim to it: Raphaël Varane, Ibrahima Konaté and Kingsley Coman all missed training on Friday, 48 hours before the World Cup final. It is not in-depth soccer journalism to suggest that is not really ideal.

“Obviously, it would be better if this was not happening,” Deschamps said on Saturday, a remark that is impressively phlegmatic, even by his standards. “We are handling it as well as possible. We are trying to take as many precautions as we can, to adapt as necessary and get on with it.” France has done all it can to mitigate the spread, isolating certain players and introducing social distancing for others.

Assuming those measures work, Deschamps still finds himself in a complicated position. All of those players laid low by illness will wake up on Sunday morning adamant that they can play. They will report to France’s medical staff that their symptoms have entirely disappeared. Deschamps will hope, of course, that they are right: He will not want to go into a World Cup final without his three first-choice central defenders.

The problem is working out how much he can trust his players’ testimonies, and their instincts. Physical tests might suggest some, or all, of them are fit enough to start, but will fatigue set in quicker than normal? Will they be able to perform to the very best of their abilities, in the (joint) biggest game of their lives if they are still dealing with the aftereffects of a virus?

And if they cannot, what alternatives does he have? France produces players in such industrial quantities these days that it has long felt as if the country could send two teams to a World Cup, each of them capable of winning the whole thing. Now does not really feel the best time to test that theory.

[Here’s How Extra Time Works at the World Cup](https://web.archive.org/web/20230824211729/https:/www.nytimes.com/live/2022/12/18/sports/argentina-france-world-cup-final-score#world-cup-extra-time-tie)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tie games are inevitable at the World Cup, especially in the later stages when the stakes rise and the sinews stretch.

But in the knockout stages, every game must produce a winner. That means if a game is tied after 90 minutes, it will go to extra time. Here’s how it works.

After a short break, the teams will play two 15-minute extra periods, including any minutes of added time the officials deem necessary. There is no sudden death: Both periods are played to their conclusion, regardless of how many goals are scored (or not).

If the teams are still tied after extra time, they go to a penalty kick shootout.

In that, a coin flip decides which side goes first. The teams then pick five penalty takers, and they alternate attempts until a winner is determined. That can take as few as three rounds of attempts — if, for example one team converts its first three and its opponent misses all three — or as many as … well … as many as it takes.

That can [sometimes take a while](https://web.archive.org/web/20230824211729/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Zncr3RaZ6k&ab_channel=Concacaf), and the longer it goes, the more fun it gets.

Except for the people involved.

In an interview this summer, Kylian Mbappé touched on a wide range of topics, but the 2022 World Cup was central among them.

He said he is focused on cementing his status as a national icon in France. He wants to win another World Cup. He wants to finally lift the Champions League trophy with Paris St.-Germain. He wants to supplant Messi and Messi’s longtime rival Cristiano Ronaldo as world player of the year and can summon — unprompted — the number of Ballon d’Or trophies each has won, perhaps the best example of how much such accolades mean to him, even as he insists collective honors come first.

A championship run here in Qatar would certainly move him further along on that quest. You can read my entire interview with Mbappé [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230824211729/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/06/sports/soccer/kylian-mbappe-champions-league-psg.html).

That this World Cup will, almost certainly, provide the conclusion to the international careers of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo has long been assumed. Their starlight is so bright, though, that it has served to obscure all of the other farewells that will come on the migrant-built fields of Qatar.

This tournament will extinguish the light of a whole galaxy. It will, most likely, be the final time Luka Modric, Thiago Silva, Daniel Alves, Manuel Neuer, Thomas Müller, Jordi Alba, Ángel Di María, Luis Suárez, Edinson Cavani, Eden Hazard and Antoine Griezmann grace the grandest stage sports has to offer. Robert Lewandowski and Gareth Bale may yet join them, part of the clutch of superstars on a valedictory tour.

World Cups, of course, have always had that purpose. Just as they are the forge of greatness, they act, too, as the place it takes its bow.

In that light, this World Cup is no different from any other. And yet the sheer numbers suggest something different. They give the impression that soccer will go into the tournament with one elite and emerge from it with quite another. That is not because there is a greater proportion of famous players at the end of their career than normal. It is because there are more famous players, full stop.

It is likely that the last 15 years will come to be seen almost exclusively through the lens of Messi and Ronaldo, the two players who have defined it. Such an interpretation, though, would be reductive. It is better thought of, instead, as soccer’s first truly global age: an era in which fans across the world could watch almost every second of a player’s career, in which the great and the good encountered one another with unprecedented frequency in the Champions League and came into our homes through video games, a time when rare talent clustered together at a handful of superclubs.

The generation that will exit the stage in Qatar is the last bastion of the first generation of players who started and ended their journeys in that ecosystem.
