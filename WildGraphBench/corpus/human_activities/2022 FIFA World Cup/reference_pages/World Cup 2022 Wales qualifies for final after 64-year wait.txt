COLLECTED BY

 Organization: [Archive Team](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam)

![Image 2: The image shows an archive team going to rescue your shit, and contains two plastic crates filled with old CD-ROMs, as well as a cabinet of old-fashioned cassette tapes](http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg) Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history. 
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at [archiveteam.org](http://www.archiveteam.org/) and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php), providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

**The Archive Team Panic Downloads** are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

Captain and Wales' record goal-scorer Gareth Bale was architect of the Welsh goal

**Wales has qualified for the World Cup for the first time in 64 years after beating Ukraine in a play-off for this year's finals in Qatar.**

[Wales beat Ukraine 1-0](https://web.archive.org/web/20220605181754/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60869800) in Cardiff after captain Gareth Bale's free-kick was deflected into the visiting goal by Ukraine skipper Andriy Yarmolenko.

Wales will play in [Group B with England and Iran](https://web.archive.org/web/20220605181754/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/60962193) at November's World Cup.

Wales' first minister joined Michael Sheen, Gabby Logan and Welsh fans from around the world praising the team.

"It's amazing what we can achieve when the whole country comes together," said Mark Drakeford.

"Commiserations to Ukraine - despite our differences on the field, Wales stands with you."

The Welsh men's team have not played at football's World Cup finals since 1958 - the longest drought of any team in Europe.

Only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another World Cup final.
