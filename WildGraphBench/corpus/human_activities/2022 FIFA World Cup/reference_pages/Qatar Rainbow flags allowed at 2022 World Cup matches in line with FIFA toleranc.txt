Qatar: Rainbow flags allowed at 2022 World Cup matches in line with FIFA tolerance & inclusion policy; activists call for changes to protect LGBTQI+ Qataris in law
===================================================================================================================================================================

"AP exclusive: Qatar to allow rainbow flags at 2022 World Cup," 10 Dec 2020

Rainbow flags will be allowed in stadiums at the 2022 World Cup after Qatar said it would comply with FIFA rules promoting tolerance and inclusion...

concerns persist about the treatment facing gay fans in Qatar due [to] the conservative religious code prohibiting same-sex relations that conflict with FIFA’s stance against homophobia.

FIFA said it was determined to push Qatar on staging a “tournament that is inclusive”...

Qatar’s World Cup leadership has offered FIFA the assurances that displays promoting LGBTQ rights will not be removed...

Anti-discrimination activists want Qatar to go further by changing the laws.

“What it doesn’t do is help the LGBTQ+ Qatari community,” said Chris Paouros, a member of the English Football Association’s inclusion advisory board...

“...ultimately we do this work because we want to make sure that everybody can be free to be who they are and if you’re a Qatari and you’re not able to, then it just feels like window dressing.”

Pressure will be intensified on Qatar ahead of the World Cup opening in November 2022.
