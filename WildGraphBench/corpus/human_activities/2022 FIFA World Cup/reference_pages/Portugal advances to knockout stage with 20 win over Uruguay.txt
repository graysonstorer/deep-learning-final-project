Was it Ronaldo or Fernandes' goal?

Bruno Fernandes wins man of the match award
-------------------------------------------

Bruno Fernandes has been crowned man of the match following his double against Uruguay.

His first goal looked like it may have skimmed Cristiano Ronaldo's hair but replays were unclear and it was eventually credited to the Manchester United midfielder.

There were no such doubts about his second goal as he perfectly placed his penalty into the back of the net.

FULL-TIME Portugal 2-0 Uruguay
------------------------------

Not the most convincing victory for Portugal (again) but they're through with a game to spare. Fernandes and Bernardo Silva were excellent, Ronaldo and Carvalho were decent and, although they look suspect defensively, Portugal do have the talent to go deep in this tournament.

As for Uruguay, questions will be asked of their defensive, going-for-a-draw approach. Looks like a tournament too far for them. That said, they came back strong in the latter stages before a triple Portugal sub and a very, very dodgy penalty quelled their momentum.

That grudge match against Ghana is lip-lickingly tasty.

How's your luck
---------------

Portugal have used up all their luck with that penalty. Fernandes drills one against the post now.

Rochet man
----------

Almost a hat-trick for Bruno Fernandes but Rochet saves his rocket at the near post.

Need a favour
-------------

Unless they won today Uruguay were always going to have to beat Ghana in their final match, but now they'll need Portugal's help as a South Korea win there (depending on goal difference) could see them through in that scenario.

What are the rules
------------------

If I were Giménez, I would simply remove my arm from its socket whenever I’m falling toward the ground.

We’ve been in the VAR era for years and I’m still no closer to understanding IFAB’s handball criteria.

Come on lad
-----------

Essentially the ref has judged that Gimenez deliberately handled the ball. Massive "game's gone" vibes. Imagine if this was the final.

GOAL Portugal 2-0 Uruguay
-------------------------

And that's game over. BRUNO FERNANDES steps up and coolly hops, skips and side-foots beyond Rochet for what looks like his second goal of the night, after two assists against Ghana.

Uruguay's fans are very angry. And rightly so.

Peno
----

Bruno Fernandes is sauntering into the box, Gimenez accidentally handles the ball as he slides in...and after checking the monitor the ref has given a pen. It's purely accidental, he can't move his hand as he's trying to do a _slide tackle_. But yeah.

Petered out
-----------

Uruguay's charge has petered out a bit, those subs have helped Portugal gain a bit of calm in midfield. We're on 87 minutes, still plenty of time for an equaliser.

Attendance
----------

The attendance has been announced as "88,668 (full capacity)". Remarkable! It is very full, and people have stayed for the second half, but there are a few empty seats...

Triple change
-------------

Wolves midfielder Matheus Nunes, Fulham's supreme DM Joao Palhinha and young in-form Benfica striker Goncalo Ramos on.

Felix, Carvalho and Ronaldo off.

Another chance
--------------

I'm all for Fernando Santos sending on a winger for a DM but Portugal are wide open here and they're going to concede soon you fancy. Giorgian de Arrascaeta breaks through the back line but, like with Bentancur earlier, can't lift the ball over Diogo Costa. Really good save though, he was off his line sharpish.

Just wide
---------

Uruguay knocking at that door now. Set up for a frantic final 15 mins. Suarez collects a free-kick and fires narrowly wide of the post. Snap-shot but you expect him to bury that.

Off the post
------------

Maxi Gomez with an immediate impact and almost a goal. Thwacks one off the post from the edge of the box. Proper ping off the woodwork. Pellistri helped get that one going with some more direct running, he's been good.

Subs
----

Right everyone grab a bag of popcorn. Luis Suarez is on and he's up against Pepe.

Maxi Gomez also on. Cavani and Nunez, both pretty ineffective, depart.
