COLLECTED BY

 Organization: [Archive Team](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam)

![Image 2: The image shows an archive team going to rescue your shit, and contains two plastic crates filled with old CD-ROMs, as well as a cabinet of old-fashioned cassette tapes](http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg) Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history. 
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at [archiveteam.org](http://www.archiveteam.org/) and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php), providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

**The Archive Team Panic Downloads** are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

Removing rainbow flags from supporters at the [World](https://web.archive.org/web/20220401121539/https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/world) Cup later this year would be an unacceptable act by the [Qatari](https://web.archive.org/web/20220401121539/https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/qatar) authorities, the Fare network has said.

A senior security official for the host country’s government told the [Associated Press](https://web.archive.org/web/20220401121539/https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/associated-press) that flags could be confiscated from people to protect them from being attacked by others.

Fare, which was part of a group of 16 organisations which is seeking assurances from tournament organisers over the safety of fans from the LGBTIQ+ community, said the suggestion that flags would be removed to ensure safety would be seen as a pretext and that the “bigger danger” to the community was the state, not intolerant supporters.

The idea that the flag, which is now a recognised and universal symbol of diversity and equality, will be removed from people to protect them, will not be considered acceptable, and will be seen as a pretext.

Fare network

“The reassurances of safety we are seeking from the Supreme Committee and government of Qatar are categorical,” a statement from the network read.

“The LGBTIQ+ community should be allowed freedom of expression and be protected in exercising those rights. This is the international norm.

“The rainbow flag will be worn by thousands of people in Qatar, by LGBTIQ+ visitors and regular supporters. The idea that the flag, which is now a recognised and universal symbol of diversity and equality, will be removed from people to protect them, will not be considered acceptable, and will be seen as a pretext.

“From our experience of Qatar and the work we have done there we do not expect the local Qatari population or visiting fans to be attacked for wearing the rainbow flag, the bigger danger comes from state actions.”

Qatari law criminalises same-sex relationships, but [FIFA](https://web.archive.org/web/20220401121539/https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/fifa) and the Supreme Committee insist supporters from the LGBTIQ+ community will be made welcome in the country during the World Cup.

The president of the [Norwegian](https://web.archive.org/web/20220401121539/https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/norwegian) football federation, Lise Klaveness, told the FIFA Congress on Thursday that there should be no room for countries like Qatar to host the World Cup until they can legally guarantee safety and respect for the LGBTIQ+ community.

She said: “In 2010, World Cups were awarded by FIFA in unacceptable ways with unacceptable consequences. Human rights, equality, democracy, the core interests of football, were not in the starting XI until many years later.

“There is no room for authorities who did not secure the freedom and safety of World Cup workers.

Hassan Al Thawadi took issue with the comments made by Lise Klaveness (Nick Potts/PA)

“No room for hosts that cannot legally guarantee the safety and respect of LGBTQ+ people coming to this theatre of dreams.”

Supreme Committee secretary general Hassan Al Thawadi criticised Klaveness for not speaking to his organisation before speaking out.

“Madame president visits our country and made no request for a meeting, did not attempt to contact us and did not attempt to engage in dialogue before addressing Congress today,” he said.

“We will always have our doors open for anyone who wants to understand the issues and educate themselves before casting judgement.”
