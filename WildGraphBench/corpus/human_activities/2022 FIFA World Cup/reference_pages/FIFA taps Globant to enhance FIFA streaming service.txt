FIFA has inked a deal with Globant, an IT and software development company, to bolster the growth of the FIFA+ streaming service ahead of this year’s World Cup.

As FIFA+’s global platform supporter, Globant is charged with expanding the platform’s distribution and creating features to enhance the user experience, the company said.

FIFA+ [launched](https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/fifa-makes-new-bid-soccer-fans-fifa-streaming-service) in April as a free, ad-supported service, touting a mix of live streamed matches, documentaries and “more than 2,000 hours of archive content.”

Globant operates in 21 countries, boasting clients like Fox, Electronic Arts and LinkedIn, as well as partnerships with big-name tech companies like Apple, Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud.

FIFA named Globant as a regional supporter of the 2022 World Cup for North America and Europe. Globant will also sponsor next year’s FIFA Women’s World Cup.

"Since its launch in April, FIFA+ has quickly established itself as the go-to platform for fans, as well as the digital home of FIFA events, including those that will be supported by Globant over the coming years," stated Romy Gai, FIFA’s chief business officer.

"Through its multi-faceted support, Globant will play a vital role in accelerating the development of FIFA+ as a groundbreaking digital hub that inspires and engages football enthusiasts across the globe,” he added.

FIFA+ however will not provide coverage of the upcoming World Cup in Qatar – which begins November 20 – as Fox Sports and Telemundo currently hold U.S. [broadcasting rights](https://www.fiercevideo.com/cable/espn-miffed-as-fox-sports-and-telemundo-swoop-for-fifa-world-cup-rights) for World Cup coverage through 2026.

Replays of this year’s World Cup matches will be available [via Tubi](https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/foxs-tubi-turns-fifa-world-cup-fast-channel), Fox’s free ad-supported streaming TV service. Viewers can also catch the games on Peacock, FuboTV, Sling TV and Vidgo, according to [NBC Sports](https://www.nbcsports.com/washington/when-2022-fifa-world-cup-qatar-how-watch-schedule-streaming-groups).

FIFA’s partnership with Globant comes as other sports leagues look to advance their streaming strategy. Major League Baseball this month [tapped](https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/mlb-teams-google-cloud-boost-streaming-strategy) Google Cloud to improve the viewing experience across MLB.TV and the league’s other media platforms.

And the NFL this summer [debuted NFL+](https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/nfl-streaming-service-debuts-5-month), its first direct-to-consumer subscription streaming service. NFL+ offers access to live local and primetime regular season and postseason games, though users of late have reported a slew of [technical issues](https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/some-nfl-users-struggling-watch-games-app) when accessing the app.
