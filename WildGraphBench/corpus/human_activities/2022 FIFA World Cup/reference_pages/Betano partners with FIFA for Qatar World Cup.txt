The online betting operator is currently operating in 10 countries around the world – including Germany, Portugal, Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Romania in Europe – and it says that it will be using the partnership ‘to engage and excite football fans around the world during the FIFA World Cup.’

FIFA’s Head of Partnership Development, Luis Rodriguez, said of the deal: “FIFA and Betano have a shared ethos of using technology to enhance the fan experience, and we’re excited to see what they have planned to engage fans around the region. On the eve of the FIFA World Cup, this is an exciting announcement as we enter a new industry.”

Meanwhile, Kaizen Gaming CEO and Co-Founder George Daskalakis further added: "We are proud to be the first sports betting operator to partner with FIFA on the world's biggest football event.

“This collaboration will bring us one step closer to millions of football fans across the globe; our goal is to offer them a responsible sports betting experience of the highest standards that will increase their engagement with FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022."
