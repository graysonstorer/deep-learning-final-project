**Statgasm**There were 11 shots in the entire game, which is apparently the joint lowest since folk started recording such things in 1966.

**“Under Tim Howard**, the USMNT was a shining example of how with a crappy team, an awesome goalkeeper can save you from severe national embarrassment (to the maximum extent possible, i.e. not qualifying for Russia 2018 can never be forgotten), while also serving as a source of fierce pride,” writes Liisa Sletzinger. “I feel for Alsheeb. In other news, we’ll see how tomorrow goes without Howard.”

Brad Friedel is still going strong though, right? I still have nightmares about his performance against Manchester United in 2004, and 2005, and 2006, and 2007, and 2008.

Full time: Qatar 0-2 Ecuador
----------------------------

Who needs a drink? That was a forgettable and slightly weird opening game, won emphatically by [Ecuador](https://www.theguardian.com/football/ecuador). Enner Valencia scored both goals in the first half, the second a memorable header, and Qatar rarely looked like getting back in the game. Almoez Ali missed their only clear chance in first-half injury time.

Ecuador didn’t need to score any more goals, so they didn’t bother (although they might regret that if the group is decided by goal difference). Qatar become the first host team to lose the opening game of a [World Cup](https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football), and the whole experience seems to have driven Jonathan Wilson to madness. Heeeeeeeere’s Johnny!
