Breaking down England’s draw with the USMNT
-------------------------------------------

England were outplayed by the United States men’s national team in the second group game in Qatar, as Gregg Berhalter’s side earned a deserved 0-0 draw.

Gareth Southgate named an unchanged team following the impressive 6-2 win against Iran in their opening game. The U.S., meanwhile, had drawn 1-1 with Wales in their first game, because of a late penalty by Gareth Bale.

Weston McKennie impressed in midfield for the U.S., causing all sorts of problems down the right, and Christian Pulisic came closest to a breakthrough when his shot hit the crossbar in the first half.

**Dominic Fifield**, **Sam Stejskal**, **Paul Tenorio**, **Mark Carey** and **Liam Tharme**analyse the key talking points…

What the USMNT need to do
-------------------------

![Image 5: league](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

Fortunately for the United States, they have their World Cup fate in their own hands.

A win against Iran on Tuesday would see them overtake their opponents. If England overcome Wales in their final match, the USMNT would finish second with a win.

If England lose, they’d climb to first in Group B while England would finish second, unless they lose by a margin of more than five goals.

Southgate on the attack
-----------------------

![Image 7: league](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

It was interesting to hear Gareth Southgate come out on the offensive tonight and really defend the performance of his England team.

“To be a successful team at a tournament, you have to show those different faces and we did that tonight,” Southgate said, when grilled in the post-match press conference about his team’s underwhelming performance.

“I’m sure there'll be a lot of noise about the performance. But not many teams go through World Cups and get nine points in the group.”

Of the five FIFA confederations represented at this World Cup, CONCACAF remains the lone one yet to take a victory, scoring just one total goal in the process:

Oddly, all five of North America's matches thus far have come against European teams:

*   USA 1-1 Wales
*   Mexico 0-0 Poland
*   Costa Rica 0-7 Spain
*   Canada 0-1 Belgium
*   USA 0-0 England

Shades of 2010?
---------------

![Image 13: league](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

The USMNT's World Cup campaign has begun the same way it did in 2010 in South Africa: with two draws, including one against England.

Every American fan remembers how the group stage ended for the USMNT in that tournament - with Landon Donovan's dramatic 91st-minute winner against Algeria.

Can the US pull out a similar result against Iran on Tuesday?

Southgate: 'We have to stay calm'
---------------------------------

![Image 17: league](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

Gareth Southgate was asked about fans booing at the end of today's match: "Were we booed off though? I'm not sure if that was aimed at us. I don't know.

"Look, of course I want our fans to go home happy and our fans at home to have a smile on their faces, so we haven't quite managed to achieve that today.

"But people are going to react how they react and I can't let that affect how I feel about the team.

"The objective is to qualify. We have three games to do it and I imagine most teams in the competition will take three games to do it.

"And we have to stay calm in these moments. We've been through tournaments before and I know as a player and a coach.

"Look, I'm sure they'll be a lot of noise. This is the tournament of external noise. We've added another layer to that, I'm sure.

"But we're on track, a bit to do, we can still win the group, that's got to be our target."

"To come off the high of the performance the other day and, find that same energy, level of quality was always going to be a challenge.

"We thought, Jack would keep the ball well for us and get us up the pitch, and Marcus' speed, we thought would also be a threat coming into that last part of the game."

England launching it
--------------------

![Image 25: league](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

The plan looked clear — exploit the U.S. in the air. This was a sensible approach given the impact of Kieffer Moore for Wales in the second half of USA’s opening game. He caused Tim Ream and Zimmerman significant problems and was an outlet for Wales to play into and get further upfield.

England did their best to replicate this. Centre-backs Maguire and John Stones split wide at goal-kicks, positioned close to goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, but they were never used.

Instead he opted to launch the kick for distance, onto the No 9 Kane who had wingers Bukayo Saka (right winger) and Raheem Sterling (left winger) close to him, presumably the targets for knock-downs and to create quick attacks before the US defence could get organised.

It may have been logical but it was largely unsuccessful in the first half, aside from Kane winning a free-kick in the final third — he lost the aerial duels and England struggled to retain the ball consistently in the U.S. half.

Maguire was very good (again)
-----------------------------

![Image 28: league](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

For a game in which England were out of control for so long there was a lot to be said for Maguire’s performance — he played the full 90 having gone off with illness in the opening game against Iran.

Once more he showed a neat passing range, particularly looking to switch the play out to right-back Kieran Trippier with driven passes. He made a couple of crunching tackles and was comfortably England’s best defender of the box on a night in which they had to do more of that than they would have wanted or expected.

When the US had a flurry of corners in the first and second half it quickly became a case of heading practice for the 29-year-old. Maguire was one of few zonal England markers, positioned on the edge of the six yard box and routinely heading Pulisic’s corners far from England’s goal.

He made over half of England’s clearances (eight out of 15) and ranked second among his team-mates for touches (94) and passes (81).

England’s unchanged XI and strength in depth
--------------------------------------------

![Image 31: league](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

There was a logic in sticking with the line-up that had torn through Iran but where that performance had been scintillating, this proved far stodgier.

England found this reminiscent of their toils against Scotland at Wembley in the second match of last year’s European Championship, a goalless draw that prompted much concern before the recovery that took England to a first major final in 55 years. They played in fits and starts for long periods against the U.S., too, and struggled to maintain any kind of control. As matters failed to improve in the early forays after the interval, the clamour for changes rose. When the tweaks were made, England at least offered something slightly different.

There is rare strength in depth to this group and, on an evening that served as something of a reality check, that is encouraging. Jordan Henderson, replacing the ineffective Jude Bellingham, offered reassurance through his weight of experience. Jack Grealish was a distraction the U.S. could have done without, all pesky movement and quick dancing feet.

His first involvement, collecting on the left, drew a quartet of opponents towards him. The ball was smuggled away, but Grealish had fired his warning. Within seconds he was being fouled by Dest, previously so unflustered. Marcus Rashford, too, offered some urgency. Perhaps the most perplexing aspect of it all was the absence entirely of Phil Foden.

A draw is hardly damaging. Plenty of fancied sides have slipped up already in Qatar, and England never beat the US, after all. They will still qualify unless they lose by at least three to Wales on Tuesday — which feels an unlikely prospect. But Southgate and his staff have plenty to ponder. Things improved dramatically after Scotland at Wembley in the summer of 2021. Now this group have to conjure something similar again.

How USA targeted the right-hand side
------------------------------------

![Image 34: league](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

Considering the positivity surrounding England after their 6-2 thumping of Iran, they looked surprisingly flat in the first half against the USMNT.

That was testament to the tactics of the United States, particularly in midfield. They built out well from the back and rather than play through a congested central area, as mentioned above they used McKennie to pull wide — almost as a right midfielder — in more of a 4-4-2 than a 4-3-3 at times.

This resulted in the United States channelling 54 per cent of their attacking touches down the right hand side in the first half — among the most one-sided approaches of any first 45 minutes in the tournament.

With Dest keeping his discipline deeper in the USMNT back line, it created space for central midfielders like McKennie to receive in wide spaces and for Weah to use his pace as the advanced forward on the right.

England did not have an answer for this subtle tweak.

The freedom of McKennie
-----------------------

![Image 37: league](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

The U.S. is simply a different team when McKennie is playing at his best, and in the first 45 minutes against England the Juventus midfielder was effective — and thus so was the U.S.

McKennie planted himself out on the right side of the formation, spending almost the entire half as a right midfielder. And the U.S. looked to play down that side consistently, finding McKennie on the touchline as Weah lived in the channel between Harry Maguire and Luke Shaw.

McKennie, who came into the World Cup off of a quad injury, and Sergino Dest, who had played limited minutes with AC Milan before arriving in Qatar, were considered doubts for the line-up to face England. Both had picked up yellows in the first game against Wales and had fitness questions after coming out of that draw in the second half having cramped up. Both became key parts of what the U.S. was doing well against England in the first half.

McKennie had one of the best chances when he got on the end of a cross from Weah in the 26th minute. He was unmarked inside the penalty spot but put his effort over the crossbar when he should have scored. The closest U.S. chance came when Pulisic hit a left-footed shot off the crossbar, but that attack, too, started with McKennie’s solo run up the right side. It was a constant threat through Dest and McKennie.

McKennie seemed to be enjoying himself, too. In the 38th minute he leaned over the video boards to wipe his hands on the bib of a photographer before a long throw-in.

The field tilted a bit more to the left side in the second half, but McKennie and Dest were involved until they were substituted in the 77th minute. Dest, in particular, showed his ability defensively in the second half as England started to get on the ball and push more for a goal.

Retreating Kane fails to make impact
------------------------------------

![Image 40: league](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

Fifield: After the foul and the precautionary scan, legacies of that bruising win over Iran, Harry Kane would have considered this an opportunity to impose himself properly on this tournament. Assists alone will never satisfy the striker. As it transpired, frustration of a different kind awaited.

There were no obvious lingering physical effects from Monday’s game. Kane was pinging shots away in the warm-up with the England medical staff apparently unconcerned. He sprang back up unperturbed, too, from an early clattering delivered by Yunus Musah near the touchline once the contest was underway. His control and hold-up play, as he retreated deeper back to goal to assist England’s desperate attempts to bypass the US press, was invariably exemplary.

Yet England needed him at the tip of their line-up, providing bite, only for the captain to find himself peripheral. There was so little space for him to exploit in the final third. Walker Zimmerman blocked an early shot, but that was Kane’s only touch in the American box through the first half. Indeed, his interventions as the US forced a flurry of corners around the hour-mark meant that, at that stage of the game, he had enjoyed twice as many touches in the England penalty area than that of his opponents.

It still feels inconceivable that England will progress deep into this tournament without Kane far more influential than this, but the U.S. offered a blueprint here in how to nullify this team’s greatest goal threat.

The closest he came to a 52nd goal for his country was a header from Luke Shaw’s free-kick in the last minute of stoppage time, an opportunity that was awkward and guided wide.

For the captain, the wait to make his mark in Qatar goes on.

Confident US controlled the game
--------------------------------

![Image 43: league](blob:https://theathletic.com/b9a31d3949b1882a09ed2f8508d538f3)

The expectation in American circles heading into the game was that England would control things. The U.S. might be reasonably well suited to play a team that figured to have a lot more of the ball than Wales, but the talent disparity between the individual players on the team made England heavy favorites. If the U.S. were to pull off an upset, the thinking went, it would have to be through an old-school American performance based on heart, intensity and attacking in transition.

The U.S. didn’t quite claim the win, but they did surprise with their performance. Apart from a nervous opening 15 minutes, they were in the driving seat for almost the entire match.

Berhalter tweaked his usual system, positioning McKennie wider than usual, essentially using him as a right midfielder. The change worked wonderfully in the first half, as the U.S. was able to overload that side and create several dangerous chances through McKennie, right-back Sergino Dest and winger Tim Weah.

Things shifted a bit in the second 45, when the U.S. began attacking more down the left through Pulisic and Antonee Robinson, but the strong play continued. Though they couldn’t hit the net, the U.S. had the better chances, weren’t bothered all that much by England’s talented attackers and never once overawed by the moment.

The result wasn’t all that meaningful for the U.S. They still need to beat Iran on Tuesday in order to advance to the round of 16, same as they would have had they lost. But this team is on a mission for hearts and minds, as well as points. They are trying to change the way the world perceives American soccer.

They may have done a little bit of that.
