**This is how Group E stands after that seismic affair.** Until 2018, Germany hadn’t gone out in the groups at the [World Cup](https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football) since 1938. Now they’re in serious danger of two such humiliations in a row. If Spain beat them on Sunday evening, they’re for the off. The result the last time they met, in November 2020? Spain 6-0 Germany. Godspeed, Hansi.

**That is nothing more than Japan deserve!** They were the equals of [Germany](https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany) in the first half, and – sensationally – their betters in the second! It’s all down to Hajime Moriyasu’s slew of substitutes, all of whom made an impact. A managerial masterclass … and his players aren’t half bad either! Takuma Asano’s winner was an absolute _belter_. Their entire bench romps onto the field of play to embrace the men who finished the game, then Moriyasu gathers everyone to make a celebratory speech. They’ve beaten Germany for the first time in their history! Another trip to the last 16 is now very much on … and with Spain up for Germany next, the four-time winners could be eliminated in the groups again, before Sunday is out!

Sorry for all the exclamation marks, but, well, y’know.

FULL TIME: Germany 1-2 Japan

Gonda clears! The whistle goes! Japan have done a number on Germany, who lose their opening game for the second [World Cup](https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football) in a row!

**90 min +8:** Neuer is this close to doing an Alisson v West Brom, but Yoshida eyebrows away from him at the last. The ball drops to Sule on the left-hand corner of the six-yard box. Asano blocks out for a corner.

GOAL! Germany 1-2 Japan (Asano 83)
----------------------------------

What a turnaround! And what a finish this is! Asano traps a long ball down the right and skitters into the box at speed . He reaches the right-hand corner of the six-yard box, holds off Schlotterbeck, and _roofs_ the ball past Neuer at his near post! Another shock is on the cards!

**82 min:** Another [Germany](https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany) corner. Kimmich doesn’t deliver it well. Meanwhile Tim Woods is back: “Francis Lee is correct, there is a ReWe nearer the museum. The one pictured is, however, on the same street as the museum, albeit a long street. Invalidenstrasse, for any MBM readers planning a supermarket-themed tour of Berlin any time soon.”

**80 min:** Gnabry crosses from the left to force a corner. Kimmich whips into the mixer. Gonda comes off his line and flaps. Rudiger wins a header but pings it over the bar. “That Rewe picture is the one in Invalidenstraße in Mitte, it is indeed an old Markthalle,” reports Giancarlo M Sandoval. “To be fair, it’s only a couple of stations away from the Naturkundemuseum. Source: it’s my local Rewe and I sent the picture to all of my friends: ‘My supermarket is in the Guardian!’”

GOAL! Germany 1-1 Japan (Doan 75)
---------------------------------

Minamino gets involved immediately! He’s sent clear down the inside-left channel by Mitoma’s forensic pass. He sends in a shot-cum-cross that’s parried well by Neuer, but only to the feet of Doan, who slams home from six yards. That had been coming!

**63 min:** Anyway, that Rewe shop pictured during the preamble. Here’s Francis Lee: “Not really my part of town, but I’m pretty sure the ReWe supermarket pictured - and praised by Tim Woods - is further away from the Natural History Museum and housed in an old Markthalle. The one around the corner from the museum is in a horrible modern behemoth of a building. What it does have going for it, however, is the close proximity to a famous cemetery containing the luminary likes of Brecht, Heinrich Mann, Hegel, early 19th century Berlin architect Schinkel and East German writers Christa Wolf and Heiner Müller. Unable to confirm Tim’s comparison, however, as they didn’t have any branches of Waitrose in Birmingham when I was growing up, at least. Although they’re defo both a step up from the old Asda behind Villa Park.”

**55 min:** Raum slips Havertz free down the inside-left channel. Gonda rushes out to close Havertz down. Havertz can’t round the keeper, but is in the business of looking for a team-mate in front of the now-unguarded goal when the flag goes up for offside. Poor decision. Gonda and [Japan](https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan) get away with one there.

**45 min +4:** Musiala overhits a pass down the inside-right channel for Muller, who recycles possession by pulling the ball back for Kimmich. A shot is parried left to Gnabry, who crosses low for Havertz to tap home. The goal is awarded, but ludicrously so, as Havertz was miles offside. Eventually the “goal” is chalked off by VAR.

**45 min:**[Germany](https://www.theguardian.com/football/germany) stroke the ball around patiently, and for the first time this afternoon, impressively. It’s eventually worked to Musiala on the edge of the Japanese box. He spins and aims for the top left, but gets too much loft on the shot, which flies miles over the bar.

**40 min:** Kubo is sent scampering into acres down the left. He cuts back looking for Maeda. Not quite. Intercepted. Then the flag goes up for offside. [Japan](https://www.theguardian.com/football/japan) continue to look fresh in attack.

The ball drops to Kimmich, who should surely pearl a first-time shot goalwards from the edge of the box, but attempts a cushioned pass that doesn’t come off. An odd decision.
