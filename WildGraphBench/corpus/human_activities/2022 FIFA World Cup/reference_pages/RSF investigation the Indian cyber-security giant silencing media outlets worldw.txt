# RSF investigation: the Indian cyber-security giant silencing media outlets worldwide

Rajat Khare is ready to move mountains to avoid association with Appin, the cybersecurity training centre he co-founded in 2003. And for good reason: the New Delhi-based company has been accused of selling less-than-ethical hacking services, according to well-researched journalistic investigations from prominent publications, including the US magazine[_The_ _New Yorker_](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-crime/a-confession-exposes-indias-secret-hacking-industry "The New Yorker - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet")and the British news agency[_Reuters_](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-hackers-appin/ "Reuters - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet").

Since 2022, articles, newsletters and podcasts from at least 15 different media outlets have been modified or withdrawn as a result of the notices and legal charges brought forth by Khare or the Association of Appin Training Centers(AOATC), an obscure entity claiming to defend Appin’s interests and reputation. The magnitude of these gag lawsuits — known as strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPPs) —is unprecedented.

“If it becomes known that a powerful person can use the Indian court to strike down articles all over the world, everybody will do it. So it's a big deal [...] and if they succeed, they'll do it everywhere,” said a source familiar with Khare’s tactics, speaking on condition of anonymity. The source expressed deep concern about the potential consequences of the intimidating letters and prosecutions brought by Appin and its wealthy co-founder against media outlets.

_“This Indian entrepreneur and his lawyers have launched an offensive on an unprecedented global scale to keep both himself and his company’s tactics out of the spotlight. Self-censorship, pressure, lawsuits — close to 15 different media outlets around the globe have removed or modified their content to avoid reprisals. The effectiveness of these SLAPP suits, which lead to self-censorship even when the lawsuit is unsuccessful, poses a serious threat to journalism. We strongly condemn these ‘serial litigation’ methods and urge the courts to respond to these lawsuits with wisdom and good judgment. We also call on media outlets not to give in to this pressure, which endangers investigative journalism._

**Pursued by Indian courts**

_Reuters_ tops the list of victims of Khare’s legal teams. The British news agency had to wait[ten months](https://www.reuters.com/world/india/reuters-expos-hack-for-hire-world-is-back-online-after-indian-court-ruling-2024-10-26/ "ten months - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") for a New Delhi district court to reverse, on appeal, a prior decision ordering it to take down an[investigation](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-hackers-appin/ "investigation - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") titled “How an Indian start-up hacked the world”. Working with hundreds of interviews and thousands of authenticated and verified documents,_Reuters_ found that Appin had grown from a startup "to a hack-for-hire powerhouse that stole secrets from executives, politicians, military officials and wealthy elites around the globe." A lawsuit brought by the AOATC accused _Reuters_ of tarnishing Appin’s reputation.

_The New Yorker_ is another prominent victim. The AOATC brought a libel suit against the US magazine over its[exclusive investigation](https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-crime/a-confession-exposes-indias-secret-hacking-industry "exclusive investigation - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") into India’s hacking-for-hire industry. The investigation mentions Appin and recounts how Khare offered “ethical hacking” services to several European private intelligence firms.

"_The New Yorker_ fully stands behind the piece, which is an accurate and fair account on a matter of legitimate public interest. We will continue to defend the right to publish important reporting without fear or favor,” a spokesperson for the magazine told RSF. The article is still online and accessible to everyone – which is not always the case for other media outlets attacked by Khare or the AOATC.

**The domino effect**

Several journalists who investigated Appin told RSF that the ten-month-long suspension of the _Reuters_ report sent a very negative signal to investigative reporters — to the point where journalists preferred to either take down or[heavily modify](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-hack-for-hire-industry-death-by-a-thousand-cuts-when-theft-doesn%27t-work-troll "heavily modify - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") their coverage of the _Reuters_ story. For example, the Indian news site _The Wire_ said it “edited” its[own story](https://thewire.in/law/delhi-court-reuters-takes-down-story-indian-firm-hacking "own story - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") on 18 December 2023. However, when comparing the updated version with the original, RSF found that _The Wire_ had deleted information from _Reuters_ about Khare and Appin.

Some media have even censored themselves before publication — which has not always sufficed. In February 2024, the American podcast _Behind The Bastards_ dedicated two episodes to Rajat Khare without mentioning his name in the title of the episodes. “We'll see how long these episodes stay up," said one of the hosts at the beginning of the first episode. One week later, the episodes disappeared from podcasting platforms:_Behind The Bastards_ had received a letter threatening legal action, according to a source close to the case who wishes to remain anonymous.

**An impressive list of victims**

Khare had already used these tactics against Switzerland’s public television channel,_Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen_(_SRF_), in November 2022._SRF_ was ordered to provisionally remove Khare’s name and photo from an[investigative piece](https://www.srf.ch/news/schweiz/projekt-gnadenlos-wie-katar-in-der-schweiz-die-fussballwelt-ausspionierte "investigative piece - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") by a lower court in Geneva.

When contacted by RSF,_SRF_ only made broad comments about the case: “Generally speaking, it can be said that lawsuits and threats of lawsuits are being filed in an attempt to prevent SRF from reporting.” Meanwhile, one of Khare’s Swiss lawyers, Nicolas Capt, told RSF that “In Switzerland and elsewhere, my client has taken legitimate legal action — civil and criminal —to protect his honour, which has been damaged by false accusations.” Capt added that Khare “does not intend to comment on these legal proceedings.”

In the course of this investigation, RSF discovered that the relentless Khare has also tried to sue _The_ _New Yorker_ in[Switzerland](https://justice.ge.ch/apps/decis/fr/pcpr/show/3358695 "Switzerland - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet"), in addition to the lawsuit against the magazine in India brought by the AOATC.

**The mysterious “X.X.”**

When the Swiss media outlet _Gotham City_ began taking an interest in the subject in 2022, it was well aware of the risks involved. “When we learned of his existence, he had already sued media outlets [...] and he had won against the Swiss public broadcaster,” said _Gotham City’s_ editor-in-chief François Pilet. “In this kind of case, we don’t really want to be next in line. What’s more, his lawyers had made it clear to us in advance that they would sue if we published his name.” In the two investigative articles published by _Gotham City_, the Indian entrepreneur is therefore referred to as “X.X.”

This did not prevent Khare’s lawyers from ordering _Gotham City_ to modify its reporting. “The content and tone of your article are deliberately sensationalist and include many factual and erroneous confusions and shortcuts,” wrote Sandrine Giroud, one of Khare’s Swiss lawyers, in a letter seen by RSF. She added that _Gotham City_’s description of Khare was “inaccurate” and that “the facts presented target him and easily allow for his identification.” When contacted by RSF, Giroud responded, “My client has asserted his rights, in Switzerland and abroad, in order to defend himself against unfounded accusations made against him, as any unjustly accused individual would.” She added that Khare “does not wish to comment on the initiated proceedings and is leaving it to the courts.”

Despite the potential consequences,_Gotham City_, like _The New Yorker_, decided to continue publishing. According to our investigation, at least four other media outlets and public interest organisations have also refused to give in to these threats. In Canada, Ronald Deibert, the director of Citizen Lab – a laboratory that specialises in analysing cases involving online surveillance, cybersecurity and human rights – has[made it clear](https://x.com/RonDeibert/status/1738225377326288977 "made it clear - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") that he will not comply with the AOATC’s takedown demands.

The next victim of these gag suits may be French:_Intelligence Online_, an outlet that covers news in the intelligence sector, has often taken an interest in Khare and Appin. In a letter to _Gotham City_, Giroud confirmed that the French site is the subject of “right-of-reply and defamation proceedings in France,” without giving any further details._Intelligence Online_’s editor-in-chief Pierre Gastineau confirmed the existence of a legal complaint.

Khare’s strategy is impressively ambitious, as he went so far as to hire Clare Locke LLP, a US law firm that specialises in defamation cases against print, broadcast, and online media outlets. Clare Locke contacted major American outlets demanding they take down[content](https://www.wired.com/story/appin-training-centers-lawsuits-censorship/ "content - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") about Khare’s international censorship campaign, such as[this article](https://www.wired.com/story/appin-training-centers-lawsuits-censorship/ "this article - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") by the tech and science magazine _Wired_.

**AOATC: an opaque organisation**

Many media outlets, including _The_ _New Yorker_ and _Reuters,_ have been contacted or sued by the AOATC, even though this entity is not mentioned in their investigations. The AOATC seems to systematically contact and sue media outlets that discuss Appin and Khare, even though the organisation presents itself as an “autonomous body” that supports and manages training centres operating under the Appin franchise.

On 3 October 2024, during the lawsuit against _Reuters_,[even the Indian judicial system](https://rsf.org/sites/default/files/medias/file/2024/11/DLNW010115822022_23_2024-10-03.pdf) questioned the legitimacy of AOATC’s complaint, pointing out that it was only created in 2022 and would therefore not be concerned by the claims made in the _Reuters_ article, which reported on events that took place several years prior. RSF reached out to the AOATC several times, in particular about its links with Khare, but it did not respond to our interview requests. However, his lawyer, Capt,said Khare “has no links with this association.”

**Online cleansing**

In addition to the letters and complaints, other tactics have also been used to protect Khare’s online reputation._Gotham City_[reported](https://gothamcity.ch/2022/12/07/piratage-la-reputation-dun-prodige-indien-au-coeur-dun-curieux-bras-de-fer/ "reported - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") that an _Intelligence Online_[article](https://www.intelligenceonline.fr/surveillance--interception/2022/10/20/ce-que-la-coupe-du-monde-de-doha-doit-a-l-ex-corsaire-indien-du-cyber-rajat-khare,109836310-eve "article - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") was the subject of an abusive takedown request under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the US digital copyright law. After being copied onto an Indian website and backdated, the original article was flagged as a copy in an attempt to have it removed. This is not the first time this US law has been misused to censor reliable journalism; RSF has[reported](https://rsf.org/en/chad-rsf-condemns-misuse-us-law-censor-media-outlets) on the topic before.

Although Khare and the AOATC seem determined to suppress all investigations into Appin, the Indian cyber-entrepreneur maintains a strong online presence. The first page of results from a Google search of “Rajat Khare” included several posts portraying him in a much more favourable light, such as[this article](https://medium.com/@miclerry/the-biography-of-rajat-khare-a-visionary-leader-in-deep-tech-investment-73f9f913b487 "this article - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") posted on the open publishing platform _Medium_. RSF discovered a slew of similar posts, some in the form of[posts](https://medium.com/@kharerajat01/who-is-rajat-khare-ce85dfefa07e "posts - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") or[op-eds](https://www.lopinion.fr/economie/investissement-dans-les-start-up-il-est-essentiel-de-developper-une-strategie-dexit-solide-la-tribune-de-rajat-khare "op-eds - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") under the entrepreneur's byline.

But most of this content was authored by accounts with[generic](https://medium.com/@Daniel_Astor_16065 "generic - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet")[names](https://medium.com/@miclerry "names - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") accompanied by photos created by artificial intelligence, each one commenting on posts by the others. A[biography](https://medium.com/@miclerry/the-biography-of-rajat-khare-a-visionary-leader-in-deep-tech-investment-73f9f913b487 "biography - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") of Rajat Khare has been commented on and liked 300 times by only six profiles, five of which post content about Khare. One of the[_Medium_ accounts](https://medium.com/@miclerry "Medium accounts - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") displays the same profile photo as a[different author](https://vocal.media/authors/anthony-grynchal "different author - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet") on the platform _Vocal Media_, and both write solely about Khare.

RSF tracked down one of the authors of the articles praising Khare. He recognised having written his content “with the help of Chat GPT,” but did not wish to explain why he used a pseudonym. When asked about his motives and whether he had any links with Khare, he replied that he had written the articles for personal reasons, enigmatically adding, “Not everything is in my hand.”

Profiles with user names referring directly to Khare, such as “[RajatKhareLuxembourg](https://medium.com/@RajatkhareLuxembourg "RajatKhareLuxembourg - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet")” and “[RajatKhareInvestor1](https://medium.com/@RajatKhareInvestor1 "RajatKhareInvestor1 - ouverture dans un nouvel onglet")”, were posting these types of articles on _Medium_ as far back as 2022, praising Khare’s career as a tech entrepreneur and his skills as an investor in a clear attempt to flood the Internet with this content and drown out the troublesome investigations.

Is Khare behind all these flattering articles, which – unlike the journalistic investigations – do not appear to have been subjected to hostile litigation? When contacted through his lawyer, Khare did not respond to our interview requests and declined to comment on these admiring posts "by third parties,” about which he claims “to know nothing.”
