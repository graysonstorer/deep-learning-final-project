The bid unveiled five eco-friendly, carbon-neutral stadia to media fanfare in Dubai in April. The five stadia are: Al-Khor, Al-Wakrah, Al-Shamal, Al-Rayyan and Al-Gharafa .

Each of the five stadiums will harness the power of the suns rays to provide a cool environment for players and fans by converting solar energy into electricity that will then be used to cool both fans and players at the stadiums. When games are not taking place, the solar installations at the stadia will export energy onto the power grid. During matches, the stadia will draw energy from the grid. This is the basis for the stadiums’ carbon-neutrality.

The upper tier of each of the five stadiums will be removed after the tournament. They will then be donated to developing countries that lack sports infrastructure. During the FIFA World Cup™, if we win the right to host, the capacity of each stadium will be able to accommodate between 40,000 and 50,000 fans. When the tournament ends, the lower tiers of the stadia will remain in Qatar, able to accommodate between 20,000 and 25,000 fans, suitable for local football, while the upper tiers will be sent to developing nations.

We see sending the stadiums to developing nations as an integral part of our bid, as doing so will allow for the further development of football on the global stage. Along with the stadiums, we plan to make the cooling technologies we’ve developed available to other countries in hot climates, so that they too can host major sporting events.

### Al-Gharafa Stadium

The existing 21,175 capacity Al-Gharafa stadium will be expanded to 44,740 seats using modular elements forming an upper tier. The facade will be made up of ribbons representing the nations that qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and will symbolize football and the mutual friendship, tolerance and respect that the tournament represents. The stadium will be downscaled to its existing capacity after the tournament ends.

### Al-Khor Stadium

Al-Khor is a brand new 45,330 capacity stadium with a stunning seashell motif and a flexible roof. The permanent lower tier seats 25,500 and the modular upper tier seats 19,830. The stadium offers spectators a stunning view of the Arabian Gulf from their seats and will be located in a sports and recreation zone.

### Al-Rayyan Stadium

The existing Al-Rayyan Stadium with a seating capacity of 21,282 will be expanded to 44,740 seats using modular elements to form an upper tier. The stadium is designed with a special "media facade" membrane that acts as a screen for projecting news, updates and current matches. The stadium will be downsized to its current capacity after the tournament.

### Al-Shamal Stadium

The brand new Al-Shamal stadium has a capacity of 45,120 with a permanent lower tier of 25,500 seats and a modular upper tier of 19,620 seats. The stadiums shape is derived from the "dhow" fishing boat of the Arabian Gulf. Spectators are expected to arrive from the Doha Expressway, water taxis, the Bahrain-Qatar Friendship Bridge and the new metrorail.

### Al-Wakrah Stadium

The brand new 45,120 capacity Al-Wakrah stadium will be located in a sports complex that will consist of an aquatic centre, spa, sports facilities and a mall. The centre will be a bustling centre 365 days a year and is adjacent to the future routing of the Doha Expressway.
