# France vs Morocco World Cup score, highlights, result as Hernandez and Kolo Muani fire Les Bleus to final

Theo Hernandez fired France into an early lead before substitute Randal Kolo Muani sealed a 2-0 victory against an excellent Morocco at Al Bayt Stadium, to send Les Blues into the World Cup final.

France remained on course to become the first team since Brazil in 1962 to retain the world title and will now meet Lionel Messi and Argentina in the showpiece.

Morocco have been the surprise package of Qatar 2022 and Walid Regragui's side responded superbly after Hernandez's fifth-minute opener, pinning back the world champions for significant periods in a display of considerable courage and skill.

But Eintracht Frankfurt striker Kolo Muani proved to be France's unlikely hero, scoring with his first touch after Kylian Mbappe had a shot blocked 11 minutes from time.

In the process of becoming the first African side in history to reach the World Cup semifinals, Morocco had only conceded once in the tournament heading into this match, and even that was an own goal.

Romain Saiss, Nayef Aguard and Noussair Mazraoui were all passed fit to start but West Ham's Aguard withdrew after the warmup and captain Saiss was substituted midway through the first half when clearly struggling.

That uncertainty seemed to contribute to a chaotic France opener, where Antoine Griezmann seized upon a slip from Jawad El Yamiq and cut the ball back to Mbappe. The Paris Saint-Germain star had his first effort blocked and a second looped up off Oliver Giroud, with Hernandez alive to the possibilities as he found an acrobatic finish.

Giroud struck the upright as Saiss' thigh gave out, but Hugo Lloris had already produced a save at full stretch from Azzedine Ounahi by that point and El Yamiq almost atoned for his error with an overhead kick that thumped the base of the post.

Mbappe tried to get France back on the front foot after the restart but it was another winger, Chelsea's Hakim Ziyech, who was the outstanding attacker of the half, orchestrating several intricate attacks down the right flank.

Ibrahima Konate, only playing after Dayot Upemacano was ruled out through illness, made last-ditch clearances and France only had breathing space when Mbappe's quick feet made room for a half-blocked shot that fell kindly for Kolo Muani, who had only been on the field for 44 seconds.

The memories of Morocco's incredible run will last much longer.

France vs Morocco as it happened, highlights from 2022 World Cup
----------------------------------------------------------------

**FULLTIME**: France have done it. Didier Deschamps can become the first coach in history to win the World Cup twice. Morocco's players fall to the turf. Some of them are in tears but many of them have changed their lives over the past few weeks, not to mention given their incredible fans memories to last a lifetime.

**90th minute+4**:Oh my word, how has that not gone in??? Abde Ezzalzouli causes chaos down the France right. The ball breaks on Azzedine Ounahi and his shot skids through the crowd to be blocked on the line by Jules Kounde.

**90th minute+3**: Morocco still plugging away. The excellent Azzedine Ounahi has a shot deflected over.

**90th minute+2**: Kylian Mbappe looks to apply a little garnish to the victory, nutmegging Sofyan Amrabat and charging into the Morocco box before Achraf Hakimi makes the tackle.

**90th minute**:Zakaria Aboukhlal finds some space to drive a left-footed shot at Hugo Lloris. There'll be six minutes of additional time.

**85th minute**: Morocco are continuing to press and ask questions. They've been excellent tonight. But their race is almost run.

**79th minute: GOOOOAAAALLLL!!!!!Randal Kolo Muani!!!**

Not a bad time to score your first international goal. Kylian Mbappe fashions some room to shoot with quick feet. His effort is half-blocked but it falls to Kolo Muani to tap home at the back post. France are heading back to the final.

**78th minute**:Abderrazak Hamdallah is a bit of a random factor. He's down the France right now, does some stepovers but sends his cross into the side netting from a good position.Abde Ezzalzouli is on for Selim Amallah for Morocco, while Randal Kolo Muani comes on for his fourth France cap.

**76th minute**: An incredible twinkled-toed run by Morocco substitute Abderrazak Hamdallah, but why doesn't he shoot? France are eventually able to scramble clear after Raphael Varane gets a foot in.

**74th minute**: Sofyan Amrabat loses possession to Youssouf Fofana. The France midfielder exchanges passes with Marcus Thuram and lashes wide. A pass to Kylian Mbappe looked to be on inside.

**72nd minute**: Oohhh, another good set piece from Antoine Griezmann and Marcus Thuram should score. He can't make a clean headed contact.

**70th minute:**France tend to play in bursts and we might be in the middle of one now. Ousmane Dembele gets going down the right and Noussair Mazraoui makes an important challenge.

**69th minute:**Auxilary defender Antoine Griezmann whips in a free-kick from the left after Achraf Hakim fouls Marcus Thuram. France keep the attack alive and Kylian Mbappe's shot is blocked.

**67th minute:**Early opportunity for Aboukal, who gets a touch on a ball into the six-yard box but Hugo Lloris catches.

**66th minute**: A couple of surprising substitutions: Marcus Thuram has replaced Olivier Giroud, with Didier Deschamps perhaps thinking there will be more and more spaces left by Morocco on the break, while the impressive Sofiane Boufal is off and Zakaria Aboukal comes on.

**63rd minute**: Morocco are zeroing in on France's left flank. Sofiane Boufal gets involved in the fun with Hakim Ziyech this time, only for Antoine Griezmann to again get back for some vital defending. He's just invaluable to Didier Deschamps.

**57th minute**: Antoine Griezmann now gets back to scramble clear after Hakim Ziyech orchestrates another fine Morocco attack down the France left. Meanwhile, Mbappe needs treatment on his ankle after a challenge from Achraf Dari. he needs to change his boot and that might just give his teammates time to clear their heads.

**54th minute**: Another-almost chance for En-Nesyri. More last-ditch defending from Ibrahima Konate. The Morocco fans are making some serious noise, even by their standards.

**53rd minute**: After that early France flurry, Morocco are back all over them. Sofiane Boufal puts a dangerous cross into the box that Youssef En-Nesyri just can't get on the end of.

**51st minute**: Another Morocco attack but Mbappe charges away on the break. He's at full flight down the left,**but Sofyan Amrabat flies into an incredible tackle**. He was off the floor a little, so pushing the boundaries of what's allowed nowadays. But that's a sensational piece of defending. The Morocco fans went wild.

**50th minute**: Hakim Ziyech stands up Theo Hernandez and darts past him to cross. His low delivery is cleared by Ibrahima Konate.

**49th minute**: France definitely want to put this one to bed after their dicey end to the first half. Antoine Griezmann looks for Kylian Mbappe with a through ball but Yassine Bounou gets there first and takes a kick for his troubles.

**47th minute**: Mbappe is certainly giving it a good go! He leaves Achraf Hakimi for dust down the left but his cutback is overhit.

**46th minute**: We're back underway. Can France make another fast start like they did from the first whistle?

**Halftime**: You feared Morocco might collapse after Theo Hernandez gave France an early lead, certainly as their captain Romain Saiss hobbled out of the action after Olivier Giroud had hit the post. But the Atlas Lions finished the half on top, with Jawad El Yamiq's overhead kick striking the upright. This one is far from over. The next goal is enormous.

**45th minute+3:**France are hanging on for the halftime whistle here, as Lloris punches another dangerous Hakim Ziyech delivery out of his six-yard box.

**44th minute**:**Morocco hit the post!**Jawad El Yamiq, who was partly culpable for the opening goal, launched a stunning overhead kick after France didn't fully deal with Hakim Ziyech's corner. A combination of Hugo Lloris' fingertips and the bottom of the upright preserved Les Bleus' lead.

**43th minute**: Lovely play from Morocco, who quickens the tempo and Azzedine Ounahi slides a ball down the right channel for Achraf Hakimi. He wins the corner after an excellent challenge from Ibrahima Konate.

**39th minute**: Antoine Griezmann gets his sparkling feet going down the right and Jawad El Yamiq slides in to concede the corner. No one really picked up Raphael Varane's near-post run but the Manchester United defender's attempt doesn't threaten.

**36th minute**: Woooahhh, almost 2-0. Hakim Ziyech coughs up possession and France are lightning in transition. Kylian Mbappe looks set to double the lead but his effort is hacked out of the goalmouth. The attack stays alive and Giroud really should have his fifth of the competition as he shoots wide.

**35th minute**: Antoine Griezmann's corner from the right is only half cleared before Youssouf Fofana takes on an ambitious shot on the turn and sends it way wide.

**34th minute**: Not for the first time tonight, Giroud has a teammate blast a shot at him. Mbappe cutting in from the left on this occasion. Theo Hernandez remains in the wars after Achraf Dari left one in on him a little bit.

**32nd minute**: Lovely play through the midfield by Morocco. As usual, it starts with Sofyan Amrabat and substitute Selim Amallah advances the attack, almost finding the throughball to Youssef En-Nesyri. Overall, its been a pretty good response to going behind from the Atlas Lions.

**27th minute**: Theo Hernandez looks in some pain here. The goalscorer got a foot in to turn away a Morocco attack, but that put his knee at an uncomfortable angle and there was also a coming together with Sofiane Boufal, who is shown a yellow card.

**21st minute**: It's a sad end for Romain Saiss, who hobbles off. Morocco's gamble on their captain and Nayef Aguard has not paid off.Selim Amallah comes on and that should mean a switch to a more familiar 4-3-3 for Regragui's side.

**18th minute**: Olivier Giroud hits the post! France's record goalscorer turns away from Romain Saiss, who is moving in an incredibly labored fashion, and thumps against the left upright left-footed.

**17th minute**: That's more like it from Morocco. Sofiane Boufal drives through midfield and plays in Hakim Ziyech. Unfortunately for the Chelsea winger, he lost his footing before shooting and it squirts wide.

**15th minute**: Hakim Ziyech swings a nice-looking free-kick into the France box from deep but it's headed clear and the world champions are back into a smooth and probing period of possession.

**13th minute**: Morocco need to settle down a bit here. Sofyan Amrabat just carelessly gave the ball away inside his own half. As was the case early on against England, France are pressing judiciously and setting traps. 1-0 is a bad situation for the Atlas Lions but 2-0 at this juncture would feel close to irretrievable.

**9th minute**: Almost a spectacular response from Morocco, as Azzedine Ounahi curls a right-footed effort towards the bottom corner from 25 yards. Hugo Lloris gets across and down and that's a fine save with his left hand.

**5th minute**:**GOOOOAAALLLLL!!!!! Theo Hernandez!!!!**

It looked like some last-ditch Morocco defending had done the job after Kylian Mbappe's shot on the end of Antoine Griezmann's cutback was blocked. Mbappe's second attempt hit Olivier Giroud but Hernandez was alert to the possibilities with an acrobatic finish at the back post.

**4th minute**: Aurelien Tchouameni looks to break into a dribble but the ever-alert Sofyan Amrabat mops up in the Morocco midfield.

**1st minute**: The game is underway. In a late change to the Morocco 11, Achraf Dari is playing instead of Nayef Aguard, who mustn't have been as back to fitness as he thought.

**5 mins from kickoff**: The teams are out and we're into the anthems. Wow, that was just massive from Morocco. Walid Regragui well into things on the sideline too. The atmosphere in Al Bayt Stadium is incredible.

**20 mins from kickoff**: Much like Gareth Southgate, whose England he downed in the previous round, Deschamps is once again facing a coach who admires him greatly. "France made me dream in 2018 with the way they played," Walid Regragui said pre match. "Deschamps understood how to do it – let's stop with statistics."

Regragui has made me pretty self-conscious, to be honest, because— as you'll have noticed— a lot of the Twitter embeds we use on here feature a statistic or two. To redress the balance, here's Sofiane Boufal dancing with his mum.

**50 mins from kickoff**: It will be interesting to see how they all hold up over the course of a possible 120 minutes but it's a gigantic boost to Morocco boss Walid Regragui. Romain Saiss, Nayef Aguard and Noussair Mazraoui all start.Jawad El Yamiq being retained means it looks like a back five for the Atlas Lions, which probably makes sense against all of France's considerable attacking firepower. If the extra centre-back gives Mazraoui and Hakim Ziyech extra licence to get forward then all the better.

**1hr 15 mins from kickoff**: And this is what the France team looks like. Those earlier reports were on the money, with Ibrahima Konate and Youssouf Fofana coming in for Dayot Upamecano and Adrien Rabiot.

**2hrs from kickoff**: Thankfully for Deschamps, there don't appear to be any doubts about Antoine Griezmann's availability. Deployed in a midfield role, the Atletico Madrid star has been in sparkling form in Qatar.

**2 hrs 20 mins from kickoff**: A sickness bug has compromised France's preparations and [L'Equipe is reporting](https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/La-compo-des-bleus-contre-le-maroc-avec-fofana-et-konate-rabiot-et-upamecano-remplacants/1370076)that central defender Dayot Upamecano and midfielder Adrien Rabiot will not start tonight, with Ibrahima Konate and Youssouf Fofana coming in to take their places. Confirmed team news should be with us within the hour.

**2 hrs 40 mins from kickoff**: France have broken a recent trend of defending champions not doing much in the way of defending their title. Italy, Spain and Germany, winners in 2006, 2010 and 2014 respectively, all bowed out in the group stage the next time around.

**3 hrs from kickoff**: This will be Morocco's sixth meeting with France. They've not won any of the previous five, while France have triumphed in their past three World Cup semifinals. Records are there to be broken, I guess...

**3 hrs 20 mins from kickoff**: A key element in Ziyech's battle with his great mate Mbappe is how much it will impact upon the Morocco full-back's attacking output. Walid Regragui's side can't afford it to dip too much, as the numbers below demonstrate.

France vs Morocco lineups, team news
------------------------------------

Multiple players were apparently feeling under the weather as a cold bug infiltrated the French squad and there was concern around the condition of starters**Adrien Rabiot** and **Dayot Upamecano** who fell ill in the days leading up to the semifinal and missed the last training session. But the latest reports from Qatar say both will start.

If either struggles during the match, **Ibrahima Konate** (for Upamecano) and **Youssouf Fofana** (for Rabiot) would be their natural replacements.

**France (4-2-3-1, right to left)**:1. Lloris (GK) — 5. Kounde, 4. Varane, 18. Upamecano, 22. T. Hernandez — 8. Tchouameni, 14. Rabiot — 11. Dembele, 7. Griezmann, 10. Mbappe— 9. Giroud

The Morocco lineup will mostly be the same from the victory against Portugal with only one change as Bayern Munich's **Noussair Mazraoui** makes his return to the starting lineup at left-back after overcoming his bout with illness.

West Ham center-back **Nayef Aguerd** has reportedly still not recovered from his thigh injury and Real Valladolid's **Jaward El-Yamiq** will continue to deputise. Even though he's also carrying a knock, it appears centre-back **Romain Saiss** will push through and play.

**Morocco (4-3-3, right to left):**1. Bono(GK)— 2. Hakimi, 18-El Yamiq, 6. Saiss, 25. Attiyah Allah — 8. Ounahi, 4. Amrabat, 15. Amallah — 7. Ziyech, 19. En-Nesyri, 17. Boufal
