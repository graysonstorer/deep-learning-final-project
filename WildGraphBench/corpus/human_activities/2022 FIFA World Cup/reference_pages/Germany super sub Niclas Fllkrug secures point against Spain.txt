Niclas Füllkrug came off the bench to score the equaliser as Germany held Spain to a draw in World Cup Group E.

**Spain 1-1 Germany

 Goals: 1-0**Morata 62' (assist: Alba),**1-1**[Füllkrug](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/niclas-fullkrug-who-is-the-werder-bremen-germany-striker-world-cup-21941) 83' (assist: [Musiala](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/who-is-jamal-musiala-bayern-munich-s-half-england-germany-star-of-the-future-11525))****

RB Leipzig’s [Dani Olmo](https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/who-is-dani-olmo-rb-leipzig-former-barcelona-wonderkid-dinamo-zagreb-9513) set the tone for a high-quality first half with a blistering strike that Bayern Munich’s Manuel Neuer did well to tip onto the crossbar. Bayern teammate Serge Gnabry returned fire as Germany grew into the contest, but his left-footed effort dropped the wrong side of the far post. Olmo then put the ball on a plate for Ferran Torres, who blazed over from an offside position. The VAR intervened at the other end to rule out Antonio Rüdiger’s header from a Joshua Kimmich free-kick. The former Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart defender stung the palms of Unai Simon with a fierce near-post volley on the stroke of half-time.

Simon almost gifted Germany the opening goal in the second half, but redeemed himself with a smart save to beat away Kimmich’s side-footed strike from inside the area. Spain took the lead through substitute Alvaro Morata’s first-time finish, with Olmo involved in the build-up, but Germany were not to be denied. Not long after Simon had kept out Jamal Musiala, Werder Bremen’s Füllkrug took the ball off the Bayern teenager and thundered an emphatic leveller into the back of the net. Leroy Sane rounded Simon in added time, but could not find Füllkrug with his cut-back. Although beaten by a Bundesliga-heavy Japan in their opening fixture, Germany can still reach the last 16 with victory over Costa Rica in their final group encounter on 1 December.

Match stats
-----------

*   Germany will defintely be through if they beat Costa Rica and Japan (also on three points) lose to Spain. Goal difference, goals scored and head-to-head records come into play, if nations end up level on points.
*   Füllkrug, who is the top-scoring German national in this season's Bundesliga, with 10 goals in 14 appearances, has netted twice in three senior internationals.
*   Musiala, 19, has a goal and three assists in 19 Germany appearances.
*   Neuer made his 18th appearance at a World Cup, taking him level with Brazil's Cláudio Taffarel and Germany's Sepp Maier for the most appearances at the finals by a goalkeeper.
*   This was the first 2022 World Cup meeting between two former world champions.
*   Olmo has 12 goals and 16 assists to show for his 73 Bundesliga outings to date.

**As it happened**

#### DUST SETTLING

So, as we take stock of a wonderful World Cup game, we can quickly assess the section. Spain are top of Group E with four points, followed by Japan and Costa Rica, who both have three. Germany bring up the rear on one point. Flick's men have to beat Costa Rica in their last game and hope Spain get a result against Japan. It could even come down to goal difference between Germany and Japan depending on the outcomes of the final games.

90'

+ 6

#### GAME OVER

That was a superb match and Germany - who were up against it at times - managed to take a crucial point thanks to Füllkrug's second international goal. A very important result for Hansi Flick's side who are alive going into the last game in the section.

90'

+ 5

#### SANE CHANCE

Leroy Sane had the match winner at his feet. The Bayern man raced clear on the left and once inside the box, decided to try to take it past Unai Simon, running out of pitch before attempting to cut back. The move breaks down. That was the chance.

90'

+ 4

#### KIMMICH AIMS ONE

Kimmich aimed a corner to the far post but it had too much legs for Rüdiger and Spain clear.

90'

+ 2

#### WIDE OPEN

Suddenly it's end to end with both teams going for it. This game is there to be won.

90'

#### TIME ADDED ON

We'll have six minutes of time added on to the end of this fascinating encounter.

89'

#### SCHLOTTERBECK FOCUS

Schlotterbeck makes a monster of a tackle to deny Morata inside the box.

#### FÜLLKRUG'S MOMENT

A big, big goal that for Germany, who were looking in serious trouble in the group. Füllkrug - as he has been doing for Werder Bremen all season - delivers a huge boost to Hansi Flick's side.

85'

83'

#### GERMANY EQUALISE

They've been pushing and pushing these past five minutes and Germany have their equaliser. It looks as if Musiala is about to take the ball through before Füllkrug muscles in and batters a finish across Unai Simon and into the top corner. Awesome finish and a second Germany goal for the Werder Bremen man.

#### SET PIECES

Free kick Germany on the edge of the area. Kimmich places the ball and strikes it into the wall. The resulting corner comes to nothing.

78'

#### GERMANY PRESSING

Germany are pushing for an equaliser but things are just not clicking for Hansi Flick's side these past few minutes. With Spain dropping the pace slightly, it looks an opportune moment for the four-time world champions to get back into this.

73'

#### MORE CHANCES

Big opportunity for Germany. Sane feeds Musiala who has a chance to wallop at goal from close range. The 19-year-old goes for power and Unai Simon beats the ball away with his upper arm. From the resulting corner, Füllkrug heads over the top.

71'

#### GERMANY CREATE

Can Klostermann, Sane and Füllkrug create the chance Germany so desperately need here? Musiala quickly feeds Füllkrug who just fails to control inside the area.

#### MORATA ON FIRE

That's Morata's second goal of the tournament and it had been coming. Spain build again here and Asensio wellies over when well placed.

62'

#### SPAIN LEAD

Olmo feeds Alba on the left. The cross comes in to the near post and Morata is already in front of Süle. The Spain striker flicks a tidy, angled finish past Neuer and into the net.

#### KIMMICH CHANCE

Spain fiddle around with the ball at the back and Germany pounce. Unai Simon gives it away and suddenly this is a very big chance. Gündogan feeds Kimmich who strikes first time for the corner. Simon recovers the situation for his side by pushing the shot away from danger.

54'

#### SPAIN CHANGE

The 2010 World champions mix things up with the introduction of Alvaro Morata for Ferran Torres.

#### KIMMICH SEARCHER

Kimmich seeks Gnabry with a looping ball over the top. Unai Simon races out to collect.

49'

#### SET PIECE POSSIBILITY

Busquets downs Gündogen wide on the left and Germany have a free kick in a very dangerous position. Raum takes but the ball bounces harmlessly away.

47'

#### NEUER ALERT

Spain break Germany's heavy press with Asensio breaking down the left. The Real Madrid man looks to pick out Torres at the back stick but Neuer gets down to snaffle the danger.

46'

#### GAME BACK ON

Germany get the ball rolling in the second half. No changes on either side.

45'

+ 2

#### HALF TIME

A very interesting and open first half comes to a close. We await the first goal of this contest.

Rüdiger wellies a shot from the right at goal and Unai Simon gathers at the second attempt. There will be two minutes of added time.

#### GOAL DISALLOWED

Rudiger heads in from a set piece on the left and Germany's players wheel away in celebration. The joy is short lived, however, with a VAR check leading to that one being chalked off for offside.

37'

#### KEHRER BOOKING

Kehrer downs Torres and that's going to be a booking for the West Ham man.

#### Yellow card

#### SPAIN AGAIN

Again Spain come. A corner from the right reaches Torres who has a bit of time before pulling the trigger. Musiala gets the block on that one.

30'

#### TORRES MISS

Spain break through Olmo on the left. The Leipzig attacker's cross is on a plate for Ferran Torres, who somehow swipes over the top. The flag was up on the far side against Olmo.

#### SHOTS ON TARGET

26'

#### SPAIN POUNCE

Neuer this time with a poor clearance and Spain are suddenly in. Ferran Torres's shot is blocked and falls into the hands of the grateful Neuer.

24'

#### GERMANY PROBE

Chance for Germany. Müller combines with Gündogan who can only deflect the ball through for Unai Simon. The Spain goalkeeper passes straight to Gnabry who takes a touch and curls wide. There was a possible offside against Müller in that move so unlikely it would have counted had Gnabry found the net.

21'

#### ALBA OFF TARGET

Gabi and Pedri look to combine on the edge of the Germany area, Süle hoofs clear. Spain come again through Jordi Alba, who drives one low at the near post. Neuer has his angles covered and watches the ball fizz wide.

#### PASS MASTERS

Spain have completed 178 passes to Germany's 63 so far.

15'

#### FREE-FLOWING SPAIN

Spain are boasting 64 per cent possession thus far. Luis Enrique's side look really hungry when pushing forward. Germany's back line will need to be on top of their game throughout here.

13'

#### CLASSIC ON THE CARDS

This game has all the early signs of being a World Cup classic. Both sides are going for it here in what is a real heavyweight encounter that's living up to its bill.

10'

#### GERMANY RESPOND

Superb build up by Germany. Gündogan flicks a fine pass in midfield towards Goretzka, who races into space and releases Gnabry to the right. Gnabry is denied by Unai Simon but the flag was up for offside in the build up.

7'

#### NEUER TO THE RESCUE

Manuel Neuer, what a save! Dani Olmo smashes one from the left and this has top-corner written all over it. Neuer dives back and thrusts a glove onto the ball, sending it against the crossbar and then the post.

4'

#### SPAIN DANGER

Spain building with some rapid, one-touch passing. Asensio just fails to get onto the end of an Olmo assist into the centre.

3'

#### SOLID OPENING

Top energy from both sides in the opening to this one. It's intense, with plenty of quick passing and heavy pressing.

1'

#### GAME ON !

Spain - all in red - kick off against Germany, dressed in all white kits.

#### ANTHEMS TIME

We will here the Spain anthem first, followed by Germany's ...

#### TEAMS IN TUNNEL

The atmosphere is electric as both teams line up in the tunnel ahead of facing off in Group E.

#### GERMANY'S HIGH HOPES

A quick reminder, then, that Germany received some good news in the group earlier with Costa Rica beating Japan 1-0. A victory here for Hansi Flick's side would see all teams on three points going into the section's final round of games. Whatever happens tonight, the four-time winners will have options to advance on Matchday 3.

#### OLMO LEADING ATTACK?

Reports in Spain suggest that Leipzig attacker Dani Olmo could well be Spain's main man up front starting out at the Al Bayt Stadium. Marco Asensio is set to play just off the Terrassa man.

#### MÜLLER WATCH

There will be plenty of eyes on living football legend Thomas Müller tonight. The Space Invader, as the Bayern man is known, has a total of ten FIFA World Cup goals to his name but he will be looking to score his first in the tournament since that 7-1 semi-final win against Brazil in 2014.

#### MUSIALA MAGIC

It's international cap No. 19 for Jamal Musiala tonight and Germany will be hoping for plenty of tricks, turns and incision from Bayern Munich's talented teen as Hansi Flick's side go in search of goals.

#### SPAIN TEAM NEWS

Spain make one change to their starting XI tonight with Cesar Azpilicueta making way for Dani Carvajal at full back. Luis Enrique's side will thus line out like this: Unai Simon - Alba, Laporte, Rodri, Carvajal - Busquets, Gavi, Pedri - Olmo, Ferran, Asensio.

#### GERMANY TEAM NEWS

Germany show two changes to the side that started the 2-1 reverse against Japan. Thilo Kehrer comes in at full back, with coach Hansi Flick opting for a back four. Nico Schlotterbeck drops to the bench. Elsewhere, with Leon Goretzka making it into the starting line-up, Kai Havertz is sacrificed. Thomas Müller leads the attack with Serge Gnabry, Jamal Musiala and Ilkay Gündogan in support.

#### CHAMPION PEDIGREE

Lest we forget, tonight's encounter pits two of the last three World Cup winners against each other. This will be the fifth meeting between the sides at the World Cup finals with Germany previously winning two to Spain's one meeting at the finals.

#### OPEN PLAY GOAL

Germany will be looking for their first goal from open play at this World Cup when tonight's game gets underway soon. Hansi Flick's men had 65 per cent of possession against Japan in their opening loss and amassed an impressive 25 shots. Germany's only goal in that 2-1 loss came from an Ilkay Gündogan penalty, however.

#### KEY CONFRONTATION

RB Leipzig's Dani Olmo coming face to face with Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer represents one of the many fascinating facets to tonight's Group E game. Olmo is on fire of late, returning from injury to lift Leipzig and scoring Spain's 100th World Cup goal against Costa Rica. Neuer, meanwhile, is still one of the game's greatest goalkeepers and will be eager to keep out his Bundesliga counterpart at all costs.

![Image 37: camera-photo](https://www.bundesliga.com/assets/icons/simple/camera-photo.svg)

#### SHARED RESPONSIBILITY

Asked about how leadership roles were allocated in the Germany squad, Borussia Dortmund attacker Julian Brandt explained, "It is spread among everyone. We are all leading players at our clubs, are all experienced. We all have to take responsibility," the Bremen native continued. "I also get the feeling that everyone wants to. The players that are on the bench will also give everything."

#### NEUER NEARING RECORD

There is plenty of speculation surrounding possible personnel changes for Germany tonight but one player who is certain to start is goalkeeper Manuel Neuer. The Bayern Munich giant is set to go level with his compatriot Sepp Maier and Brazil's Claudio Taffarel as the goalkeeper with most World Cup appearances (18).

![Image 38: camera-photo](https://www.bundesliga.com/assets/icons/simple/camera-photo.svg)

#### HAVERTZ READY FOR ACTION

Former Bayer Leverkusen favourite and current Chelsea forward Kai Havertz has been speaking ahead of what he hopes will be a 33rd senior appearance for Germany. "We’ve analysed the game [against Japan] in detail over the last two days," the forward said. "We saw where we went wrong and where we have to improve. Now it’s simply about going into the Spain game as one and giving it everything we’ve got. It will be a challenging game, but we will be ready."

#### TALE OF THE TAPE

This evening's encounter will be the 26th meeting between Germany and Spain with the former edging the win stats with nine to Spain's eight. There have been eight draws.

![Image 39: camera-photo](https://www.bundesliga.com/assets/icons/simple/camera-photo.svg)

#### "COURAGE AND BELIEF"

Germany coach Hansi Flick is aware of how important it is for his team to bounce back from their opening game loss against Japan with a solid showing against Spain. "It's important to approach this game against Spain with courage and belief in our quality," the 57-year-old explained. "We're absolutely convinced of how we want to play [and] we'll stick to our path because we're convinced that we have a team that has quality and can implement [our ideas]."

#### LUIS ENRIQUE URGES CAUTION

The Spain tactician warned his side not to dwell on their 7-0 opening game win against Costa Rica for fear they could get bitten by a wounded Germany team this evening. "[The first victory] was resounding and that gives confidence, but we shouldn't have too much confidence. We face an opponent that will hammer us if we are overconfident," 'Lucho' insisted.

#### COSTA RICA BONUS?

Of course, Germany won't want to be hearing anything about favours coming from elsewhere what with the monumental task Hansi Flick's side have to focus on this evening, but Costa Rica beating Japan earlier has thrown Group E wide open. Spain - on three points - are ahead of Japan and Costa Rica only on goal difference. Germany have yet to get off the mark.

#### WORLD CUP WELCOME !

Welcome one and all! It's time for one of the most highly-anticipated games in the first round of the World Cup with Germany taking on Spain at the Al Bayt Stadium. This is going to be HUGE !
