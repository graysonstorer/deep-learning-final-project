**90+3 min**Ziyech slides in and upends Modric, somehow escaping a card. The ref has let loads go here, which is good to see – who can forget the dismissal of Marco Ethchevery in the first game of USA 94.

No one’s saying the [World Cup](https://www.theguardian.com/football/world-cup-football) should be in Qatar – it shouldn’t. But discussion of the consequences seems a reasonable thing to do.

**83 min**Morocco have more speed about their play than [Croatia](https://www.theguardian.com/football/croatia), but they’ve not quite picked the right passes at the right times. They might, though, try and get more men into the box because at the moment, they’re reliant on everything being done perfectly, instead of putting themselves in position to pick up second balls and bum touches.

**78 min**“South Koreans never refer to themselves as 남한 (‘nam han’ - literally South Han) as Michael suggests,” instructs Nigel Ollala, “although they do call North Korea 북한 (‘buk han’ - North Han). I don’t think South Koreans would say that they are south anywhere, but instead that the north of their country is occupied. On TV in Korea you’ll see 대한민국 (‘dae han min guk’ - Republic of Korea) crammed on the screen. 한국 (‘han guk’ - Han Land) could be used. This refers to the peninsular as a whole, but is used interchangeably. North Koreans use a totally different set of names for South Korea - 남조선, the peninsular - 조선, and their country - 조선민주주의인민공화국 (!) All this, plus the fact that many countries have more than one language (so which do you choose?) means I’d just stick to English based abbreviations.”

Us: telt.
