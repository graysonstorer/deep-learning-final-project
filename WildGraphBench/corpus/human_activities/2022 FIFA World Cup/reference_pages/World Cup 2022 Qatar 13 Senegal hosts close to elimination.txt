World Cup 2022: Qatar 1-3 Senegal - hosts close to elimination
==============================================================

By Shamoon Hafez BBC Sport at Al Thumama, Doha

Last updated on 11 minutes ago 11 minutes ago.From the section [World Cup](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup)[](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63672200)64

Qatar are on the verge of a group-stage exit in their home World Cup after Senegal condemned them to a second straight loss.

The Middle East side battled valiantly but will be out with a game to spare if the Netherlands avoid defeat against Ecuador later on Friday (16:00 GMT kick-off).

But African champions [Senegal](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/senegal) are up and running.

Boulaye Dia broke the deadlock four minutes before half-time, slamming home to punish Boualem Khoukhi's miscued clearance.

Looking to hit back in the second period, Qatar's hopes were dashed when former Bristol City striker Famara Diedhiou rose to flick in a glorious header just three minutes after the break.

Watford's Ismaila Sarr had an early chance on his 50th cap but struck into the side netting, while Idrissa Gueye of Everton's rasping drive went narrowly wide.

[Qatar](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/qatar) felt they should have had a first-half penalty when Akram Afif was bundled over in the box by Sarr, but referee Antonio Lahoz pointed only for a goal-kick, much to the anger of the home supporters.

Chelsea goalkeeper Edouard Mendy made stunning reflex saves to deny Almoez Ali and Ismail Mohamad, but he could do nothing about Mohammed Muntari's powerful header.

Qatar were searching for the equaliser, but Bamba Dieng stroked in to deflate the home following and leave their team bottom of the group without a point after two games played.

### Disappointment for hosts

Qatar made history by becoming the first country from this region to host the World Cup, but are now staring at the unwanted record of becoming just the second home team to exit the competition at the group stage, after South Africa in 2010.

They need a huge favour from [Ecuador,](https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/teams/ecuador) who beat them in the opening game, to salvage any hope of remaining in the tournament.

Felix Sanchez's men, who did not have a shot on target on their World Cup debut, were backed by a raucous section of supporters behind the goal.

Other men and women dressed in traditional attire filled the stadium at the start of their weekend, but went home disappointed as their side suffered back-to-back defeats.

Senegal's class told with their starting XI featuring 10 players who feature in Europe's top-five leagues, with the exception being Sarr of Watford.

But the story could have been very different had the referee pointed to the spot for Sarr's challenge on Afif, but he left the locals outraged by failing to award a penalty.

It proved crucial as Khoukhi's scuffed clearance allowed Dia to convert the opener, and Diedhiou's unstoppable header double the advantage on 48 minutes.

Qatar, though, showed good fight to hit back via Muntari's thunderous header, which sent the partisan crowd into raptures.

But any optimism for an equaliser was killed when Dieng finished off a swift move to seal Senegal's first victory in the group.

The Qatar players were applauded by their fans at the final whistle, but some hit the deck in regret knowing their prospects of reaching the knockout stage are all but over.

15:27   Good news is Qatar are knocked out.

The WC should NEVER have been allowed to be held there and I suspect there were many brown envelopes being passed around to get the vote through.     3    0

15:27   I’ll give you credit Ndiaye even if Rio and co won’t. If that had been a De Bruyne assist they’d have been spitting on their helmets with delight. Didn’t even get any credit. Well done iliman. ⚔️     0    0

15:19   Surely they are out can Qatar gain a bonus point with final group game win then. No beginners luck for the host nation but showed what they are capable of in the second half and will gain experience.     0    1

15:19   Well on the bright side as least their 'supporters' hung around for a bit longer this time. 

I can see Qatar getting an absolute mauling from the Dutch to close out their campaign and how appropriate. Arguably the worst world cup hosts both in terms of performance and maybe even hospitality judging from what we have read.     2    0

15:16   Senegal look very timid without Mane. They will do well to beat Ecuador and are probably praying the Netherlands hammer them this evening. 

Words can't do justice to Qatar really. Just awful. At least the team made an effort in the last 15 minutes, but the fans couldn't be faffed. Crazy.     8    0

15:15   It's Sad Team Qatar realized too late that they needed to create more chances to score.More Showdown inthe second half.     0    0

15:14   Just imagine how much better Senegal would have been if Mane was playing.     0    0

15:13   Qatar plastic fans, but weren't their clothes whiter than white?

Id warrant they don't wash their clothes at a 30 degree setting, nor do they allow a red sock to get intermingled in their wash.     5    2
