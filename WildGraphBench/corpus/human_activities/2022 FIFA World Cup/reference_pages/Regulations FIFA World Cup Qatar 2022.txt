3. 

The FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™ (“FIFA World Cup 2022™”) consists of a preliminary competition and a final competition. The final competition is scheduled to be played from 21 November to 18 December 2022. Any rights associated with the FIFA World Cup 2022™ that are not granted by these Regulations and/or further regulations, guidelines and decisions as set forth in these Regulations and/or specific agreements to a participating member association in the preliminary or final competition, or to a confederation, belong to FIFA. 

4. 

These Regulations regulate the rights, duties and responsibilities of all member associations taking part in the final competition of the FIFA World Cup 2022™ (“Regulations”). The Regulations and all directives, decisions, guidelines and circulars issued by FIFA are binding for all parties participating and involved in the preparation, organisation and hosting of the FIFA World Cup 2022™. 

5. 

The FIFA Statutes and all FIFA regulations in force shall apply. Any reference in these Regulations to the FIFA Statutes and regulations refers to the FIFA Statutes and regulations valid at the time of application. 

6. 

Other rules and/or decisions that are binding on FIFA (e.g. due to FIFA being a signatory to the World Anti-Doping Code) may apply to the subject matter of these Regulations. Any such rules and/or decisions implemented by FIFA shall take precedence over these Regulations in the event of any conflict and must be complied with by each Participating Member Association. 7I General provisions 

# 2 Organising Committee for FIFA Competitions 

1. 

The Organising Committee for FIFA Competitions (the “FIFA Organising Committee”), appointed by the FIFA Council, is responsible for organising the FIFA World Cup 2022™ in accordance with the FIFA Statutes and the FIFA Governance Regulations. 

2. 

The FIFA Organising Committee may, if necessary, appoint a bureau and/or a sub-committee to deal with emergencies. Any decision taken by the bureau or sub-committee shall come into effect immediately but shall be subject to confirmation by the plenary committee at its next meeting. 

3. 

The FIFA Organising Committee shall deal with any aspect of the FIFA World Cup 2022™ that is not the responsibility of any other body under the terms of these Regulations, the FIFA Statutes or the FIFA Governance Regulations. 

4. 

The decisions taken by the FIFA Organising Committee and/or its bureau/sub-committee are final and binding and not subject to appeal. 

# 3 Other Organising Bodies

3. 

The Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (“SC”) is also responsible for certain infrastructure and other operational matters relating to the FIFA World Cup 2022™. 8

4. 

The QFA, LOC, Q22 and SC (collectively, “Other Organising Bodies”) may communicate with the Participating Member Associations from time to time on matters relating to the FIFA World Cup 2022™. Notwithstanding the foregoing, FIFA remains the ultimate authority on all operational and competition matters relating to the FIFA World Cup 2022™. If any instructions given by the Other Organising Bodies are inconsistent or conflict with instructions given by FIFA (including, for the avoidance of doubt, by the FIFA Organising Committee), then FIFA’s instructions shall always take precedence and must be complied with. 

5. 

The Other Organising Bodies shall ensure that any decision made by FIFA (including the FIFA Organising Committee or FIFA’s judicial bodies) comes into force immediately.

The FIFA Organising Committee may decide to replace the withdrawn Participating Member Association in question with another member association. 

4. 

Any match which is not played or which is abandoned – except in cases of force majeure recognised by FIFA – may lead to the imposition of disciplinary measures against the relevant Participating Member Association by the FIFA Disciplinary Committee in accordance with the FIFA Disciplinary Code. 

5. 

Any Participating Member Association that withdraws or whose behaviour is liable for a match not being played or being abandoned may be ordered by FIFA to reimburse FIFA, Q22 or any other Participating Member Association for any expenses incurred as a result of its behaviour. In such cases, the association concerned may also be ordered by FIFA to pay compensation for any damages incurred by FIFA, any Other Organising Body or any other Participating Member Association. The association in question shall also forfeit any claim to financial remuneration from FIFA. 

6. 

If a Participating Member Association withdraws or a match cannot be played or is abandoned as a result of force majeure, FIFA shall decide on the matter at its sole discretion and take whatever action is deemed necessary. 

7. 

Further to the above provision, in the case of a match being abandoned as a result of force majeure after it has already commenced, the following principles shall apply (a)  The match shall recommence at the minute at which play was interrupted rather than being replayed in full, and with the same scoreline. The match shall recommence where play was stopped when the match was interrupted (e.g. with a free kick, throw-in, goal kick, corner kick, kick from the penalty mark, etc.). If the match was abandoned while the ball was still in play, it shall restart with a dropped ball from the position of the ball when play was stopped. (b)  The match shall recommence with the same players on the pitch and

This information shall be submitted online via the team colour form by the stipulated deadline. Only these colours, once reviewed and approved by FIFA as stated in art. 28.3 below, may be worn during matches. 

3. 

The Participating Member Associations shall send to FIFA for approval a sample of all items of the full first-choice and alternative team playing kits (shirt, shorts, socks, all three goalkeeper’s kits, gloves, caps, wristbands and headbands, etc.) intended for use during the final competition. In addition, FIFA shall organise a kit-day session prior to the final competition, such date to be confirmed by circular letter. Representatives of all Participating Member Associations are obliged to attend. All equipment (kits, gloves, bags, medical equipment, etc.) that could be on display within the stadium, the training grounds and the hotels or during transfers to, from or within Qatar must be approved by FIFA. FIFA shall issue a written decision soon after the kit day regarding the approval of all submitted articles. Should any of the team kit or any part thereof not be in accordance with the FIFA Equipment Regulations and the FIFA Media and Marketing Regulations, 

VII Kit and team equipment 35 

the Participating Member Association will be obliged to change it accordingly and re-submit the corrected items within 30 days of the first written decision. These decisions are not subject to appeal. 

4. 

All equipment (kits, gloves, bags, medical equipment, etc.) that could be on display in the stadiums, the training sites, the hotels or during transfers to, from or within the host country must be re-checked and approved by FIFA during the Team Arrival Meeting for the FIFA World Cup 2022™.

VII Kit and team equipment 36 

2. 

The player’s last name or popular name shall be affixed above the number on the back of the shirt and shall be clearly legible in accordance with the FIFA Equipment Regulations.

# 29  Match colours designation 

1. 

Approximately two months before the start of the final competition, FIFA will inform the teams of the colours that they shall wear for each match of the group stage. As far as possible, each team shall wear its first-choice colours as declared on the team colour form. If the two teams’ colours and the match officials’ colour might cause confusion, the following principles shall be applied by FIFA to allocate the match colours 

(a)  Order of priority from 1 to 5 

1.  Team A playing kit 

2.  Team B playing kit 

3.  Team A goalkeeper kit 

4.  Team B goalkeeper kit 

5.  Match officials (referees) kit (b)  If the above order of priority does not produce a clear colour contrast of the kits, the allocation shall continue step by step in reverse order (5-1) until an acceptable colour contrast is confirmed. (c)  If necessary, one or both teams may have to wear a combination of their first-choice and alternative player or goalkeeper kits. 

VII Kit and team equipment 37 

FIFA will endeavour to ensure that each team wears its first-choice team playing kit at least once during the group stage. In principle, FIFA shall also consider the option of dark-kit and light-kit colour-contrast assignments in the interests of accommodating individuals with a colour vision deficiency whenever reasonably practicable. 

2. 

FIFA shall confirm the playing colours to the Participating Member Associations before the start of each match. The colours shall be reviewed during the Match Coordination Meeting by the referee assessor and the FIFA Match Director. The colours assignment decided by FIFA is final. 

3. 

The first-choice and alternative team playing kits and all goalkeeper kits (including the goalkeeper shirts without names and numbers) shall be taken to every match. 

# 30  Other equipment 

1. 

FIFA will supply a sufficient number of players’ sleeve badges with the official competition logo of the FIFA World Cup 2022™, which shall be affixed on the right-hand sleeve of each shirt. A different FIFA campaign logo may be affixed on the left-hand sleeve. FIFA will communicate to the Participating Member Associations the instructions for use of the players’ sleeve badges. 

2. 

FIFA will provide each participating team with a set of special equipment upon arrival in the host country (e.g. drinks bottles, drinks coolers, medical bags, captain’s armbands, etc.). This equipment shall be used at the stadium and official training sessions, to the exclusion of any other similar items. 

3. 

The footballs used in the FIFA World Cup 2022™ shall be selected and exclusively supplied by FIFA. Each team will receive training balls from FIFA prior to the final competition after the conclusion of the preliminary competition and all teams have successfully submitted the required team entry details.

VII Kit and team equipment 38 

also be provided to the participating teams upon arrival in the host country. Only these balls provided by FIFA may be used for training and warm-up sessions at the official stadiums and training sites. 

4. 

Only warm-up bibs provided by FIFA may be used during official training sessions and at the stadium in the pre-match warm-up, on the team benches and for the warm-up of substitute players during the match. 

5. 

Participating teams are allowed to use their own wearable tracking system, as long as the system has been tested and certified according to the Laws of the Game, registered with FIFA by the Participating Member Association for use in the final competition and otherwise complies with the FIFA Equipment Regulations, the FIFA Media and Marketing Regulations and any other applicable FIFA regulations. 

VII Kit and team equipment 39 

VIII MATCH ORGANISATION 31  Start list 

1. 

Each team is responsible for arriving at the stadium at the latest 90 minutes before the kick-off of the respective match and for providing the completed start list to the FIFA Match Director upon such arrival. 

2. 

At the Match Coordination Meetings (before each match), the teams will receive a start list with all 23 players’ full names and shirt numbers together with the full names of the team officials eligible to be seated on the bench. 

3. 

The start list should be duly completed by selecting the 11 players who will start the match, indicating the captain, selecting the team officials to be seated on the bench (maximum of 11) and signed by the head coach. Both teams must submit their completed start list to the FIFA Match Director at least 90 minutes before kick-off. If the start list is not submitted on time for any reason, the matter will be reported to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee. 

4. 

The numbers on the players’ shirts shall correspond to the numbers indicated on the start list. Each team is responsible for ensuring that the start list is completed properly and that only the 11 selected players start the match. 

5. 

If any of the 11 players submitted on the start list are not able to begin the match due to injury or illness, they may be replaced by any of the eligible substitutes as long as the FIFA Match Director and the referee are officially informed thereof prior to kick-off. Within 24 hours, the team concerned shall also provide FIFA with a medical report issued by the team doctor responsible (in one of the four official languages of FIFA). Further to the above, any injured or ill player who is removed from the start list will no longer be eligible to take part in the match, and thus cannot be selected as a substitute player at any time during the match. Such a change to the start list will not reduce the number of official substitutions that may be made by a team during the match in accordance with the Laws of the Game. Although no longer eligible to play as a substitute, the injured or ill player who was removed from the start list before kick-off may be seated on the substitutes’ bench. 

VIII Match organisation 40 

6. 

Only the players who were identified on the official start list submitted to the FIFA Match Director, or were confirmed as a warm-up injury/illness replacement player, may start the match.

3. 

Additional technical seats in the stand shall be allocated for accredited officials providing technical support to the team during the match (kit manager, assistant physiotherapist, etc.). Staff occupying such seats shall have access to the dressing rooms, with a valid SAD. 

4. 

During the match, substitutes are allowed to leave the technical area to warm up. At the Match Coordination Meeting, the FIFA Match Director shall determine exactly where they may warm up. 

5. 

A maximum of six players per team shall warm up at the same time (with a maximum of two officials). Only the goalkeeper may warm up with a ball. If there is not sufficient space behind the goals, both teams shall warm up in the designated area behind the first assistant referee. In this case, only a maximum of three players and one official per team may warm up at the same time and without any balls. 

VIII Match organisation 41

8. 

Additional special equipment items (e.g. antennae) for the use of wearable technology at final-competition matches may only be positioned in a dedicated area of a final-competition stadium defined by FIFA, but not in the technical area of such stadium.

The similar display of commercial messages and slogans of any nature in any language or form by players and officials is not allowed for the duration of their time at any official activity organised by FIFA (including official matches and training sessions, as well as during official press conferences and mixed-zone activities). 

VIII Match organisation 42 

# 34  Familiarisation sessions and pre-match warm-up 

1. 

In order to preserve the quality of the pitch for the matches, no official training sessions will be allowed on the pitches before any match. In principle, all Participating Member Associations’ official training sessions will be conducted at the team base camp training sites and/or, if applicable, venue-specific training sites. 

2. 

Teams that are due to play a match in a stadium in which they have not previously played will be entitled to a familiarisation session in that stadium on the day before the match. The players and officials will be permitted to walk around the field of play (to inspect the pitch only, and wearing training shoes) and stadium to familiarise themselves with the set-up. 

3. 

Familiarisation times will be communicated by FIFA. 

4. 

The teams will be entitled to warm up on the pitch before each match, weather and pitch conditions permitting. In principle, such warm-up will be 30 minutes long and will take place from 50 minutes prior to kick-off until 20 minutes prior to kick-off. If the pitch is not in good condition or if warm-up sessions would negatively affect the state of the pitch for the match, or if the pitch is to be used for ceremonies relating to the FIFA World Cup 2022™, FIFA may shorten or cancel the warm-up session timings and/or specify restricted areas of use.

X Financial provisions 50 

XI MEDICAL 41  Team medical doctor 

Each Participating Member Association shall include at least one medical doctor (two are recommended) in its delegation. It is a mandatory requirement that the medical doctor or any other medical staff member of each Participating Member Association complete and successfully pass the “Concussion” and “Sudden Cardiac Arrest” modules of the FIFA Diploma in Football Medicine (www. fifamedicalnetwork.com). 

# 42  Sudden cardiac arrest and concussion 

1. 

In order to discover heart issues or risk factors which might lead to a sudden cardiac arrest during matches of the final competition, and to protect players’ health, each Participating Member Association shall ensure and confirm to FIFA that its players undergo a pre-competition medical assessment prior to the start of the final competition. FIFA will provide all Participating Member Associations with an assessment form. 

2. 

A player who experiences suspected concussion during a match must undergo an examination by the team doctor in accordance with the protocols documented in the FIFA Football Emergency Medicine Manual. The referee may temporarily suspend play for up to three minutes whenever an incident of suspected concussion occurs. The referee may only allow the player to continue playing with the authorisation of the team doctor, who shall have evaluated the player and excluded any suspicion of a concussive injury. The team doctor will have the final decision based on a clinical examination and subject to an express prohibition against returning a player to play if concussion is suspected. 

XI Medical 51 

FIFA recommends that medical teams follow a graduated return-to-play protocol set forth in SCAT5 for any player who has suffered concussion. SCAT5 recognises that the time frame for return to play may vary, dependent on factors such as the player’s age, gender, their symptoms and medical history, and that doctors must use their clinical judgment in making decisions with respect to return to play. The player’s welfare must be their sole concern. FIFA requires that before any player who suffers a concussive episode can return to play in the FIFA World Cup 2022™, the team doctor certify that (a) such player has passed each of the steps set out in SCAT5, and (b) such player is fit for competition by submitting a documented report to the FIFA General Medical Officer. 

# 43  Doping Control 

1. 

Doping is strictly prohibited. The FIFA Anti-Doping Regulations, the FIFA Disciplinary Code and all other relevant FIFA regulations, circular letters and directives shall apply to the FIFA World Cup 2022™.

ANNEXE B: FAIR PLAY CONTEST REGULATIONS 

I. General provisions 1. 

As part of its campaign to promote fair play, FIFA regularly holds a fair play contest during its championships, based on an appraisal of the teams’ conduct by a FIFA delegate such as the FIFA Match Commissioner, a member of the Technical Study Group or a member of a standing committee. 

2. 

The objective of fair play activities is to foster a sporting spirit among players, team officials and spectators, thereby heightening the fans’ enjoyment of the game. 

3. 

At the final whistle of each game, the delegate shall complete the appropriate fair play form after consulting the referee and the referee assessor. 

4. 

Every match in the final competition shall be taken into account. 

5. 

FIFA shall compile and publish the classification at the end of the final competition. Its decision is final. 

6. 

FIFA will award the team that wins the fair play contest a trophy, a medal for each player and official, and a diploma, all of which the team can keep permanently. The team shall also receive a voucher valued at USD 50,000, which shall be exchanged for a supply of football equipment to be used exclusively for youth development. 

Annexe B: Fair Play contest regulations 61 

II. Assessment criteria 1. 

The assessment form contains six criteria by which the teams’ fair play performance shall be judged, stressing the positive aspects rather than negative. As a general rule, maximum points shall only be awarded if the team concerned displays a positive attitude. 

2. 

Red and yellow cards shall be deducted from a maximum of 10 points: – first yellow card:  minus 1 point – second yellow/indirect red card:  minus 3 points – direct red card:  minus 4 points – yellow card & direct red card:  minus 5 points Red and yellow cards are the only criteria entailing minus points. 

3. 

Positive play Minimum 1 point Maximum 10 points The aim of this criterion is to reward attacking and attractive play, and shall take into account such aspects as: 

a)  Positive aspects 

– attacking rather than defensive tactics; – speeding up the game; – constantly attempting to score even if the desired result (e.g. qualification) has already been achieved. 

b)  Negative aspects 

– tactics that rely on rough play; – play-acting; – time-wasting etc. c)  As a general rule, positive play is correlated with the number of scoring chances created and the number of goals scored. 

Annexe B: Fair Play contest regulations 62 

4. 

Respect towards the opponent Minimum 1 point Maximum 5 points Players are expected to respect the Laws of the Game, the competition regulations and opponents, etc. When assessing the players’ behaviour towards the opponents, duplication of the judgment for red and yellow cards should be avoided. However, the delegate may take into account the seriousness of the offences punished by cards as well as those overlooked by the referee. Assessment shall be based on positive attitudes (e.g. helping an injured opponent) rather than on infringements. Behaviour that is basically faultless but does not outwardly show any particularly positive attitude or gesture towards opponents shall be given a mark of 4 rather than 5. 

5. 

Respect towards the referee/match officials Minimum 1 point Maximum 5 points Players are expected to respect the match officials and the decisions they take. A positive attitude towards the referee, including acceptance of decisions without protest, shall be rewarded. Behaviour that is basically faultless but does not outwardly show any particularly positive attitude or gesture towards the match officials shall be given a mark of 4 rather than 5. 

6. 

Behaviour of the team officials Minimum 1 point Maximum 5 points Coaches and other team officials are expected to encourage the sporting, technical, tactical and ethical standards of their team and to direct the players to behave in accordance with the principles of fair play. Both positive and negative factors in the behaviour of the team officials shall be 

Annexe B: Fair Play contest regulations 63 

included in the assessment, such as for instance whether they calm down angry players or how they accept the referee’s decisions. Inciting or provoking players shall be rated negatively. Cooperation with the media shall also be a factor in the assessment. Behaviour that is faultless but does not outwardly show any particularly positive attitude or gesture shall be given a mark of 4 rather than 5. 

7. 

Behaviour of the crowd Minimum 1 point Maximum 5 points The crowd is considered to be an integral part of a football match. Fans can contribute to the positive atmosphere of a match by encouraging their team by cheering and singing, etc. in the spirit of fair play. Spectators are, however, expected to respect the opponents and the referee. They should appreciate the opponents’ performance regardless of the result and in no way intimidate or frighten opponents, the referee or the opponents’ supporters. The maximum number of points (5) may only be awarded if all these requirements have been satisfied, especially as regards creating a positive atmosphere. This criterion is applicable only if a substantial number of fans of the team concerned are present. If the number of fans is negligible, “n.a.” (not applicable) shall be entered under this item. 

Annexe B: Fair Play contest regulations 64 FIFA W orld Cup 2022 TM 

III. Final assessment 1. 

The final assessment of a team is obtained as follows: a)  the points awarded are added together, e.g. for team A: 8 + 7 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 4 = 31 b)  this total is divided by the maximum number of points possible (40): 31 ÷ 40 = 0.775 c)  this figure is multiplied by 1,000: 0.775 x 1,000 = 775 If, however, the number of fans supporting a certain team is negligible and the “behaviour of the crowd” criterion consequently disregarded (“n.a.” – cf. art. II par. 7 of the fair play contest regulations), the maximum number of points obtainable will be 35. Thus the final assessment would be attained as follows: a)  the points awarded are added together, e.g. for team B: 7 + 8 + 2 + 5 + 2 = 24 b)  this total is divided by the maximum number of points possible (35): 24 ÷ 35 = 0.686 c)  this figure is multiplied by 1,000: 0.686 x 1,000 = 686 The overall assessment of a team during the final competition shall be calculated by adding the points attained at each match and dividing this figure by the number of matches played. 

2. 

Teams that are eliminated after the group stage of the final competition shall be excluded from the fair play contest. In addition to making the assessment, members of FIFA may give a short oral account of the teams’ fair play performance to explain the positive and negative factors, which form the basis of their assessment. The account may also point out any outstanding gestures of fair play from a player, official, referee or any other person. However, no additional points shall be awarded for this reason. 65 FIFA W orld Cup 2022 TM
