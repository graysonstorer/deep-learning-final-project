Match report: South Korea 2-3 Ghana
-----------------------------------

**Group H:** Ghana’s task is now clear: bury the ghosts of Soccer City and reach the knockout stage,” writes Nick Ames from Education City Stadium. “Victory over Uruguay, who defeated them so heartbreakingly on that climactic night in 2010, would complete the job and on present form drama seems a given.”

**It’s a terrific win for Ghana.** An absolutely thrilling game, the second of the day, draws to a close and Ghana’s players are beside themselves with delight. The players of [South Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/southkorea) are devastated and the camera cuts to the stands where many of their fans are in tears. Their manager Paulo Bento has been shown a red card for his part in the post-final whistle protests.

His side are bottom of the group with just one point from two games and will have to beat Portugal in their final game to have any chance of going through. Ghana go second, behind the Portuguese, with three points with a final group game against Uruguay ahoy. The South American side take on Cristiano Ronaldo and chums in this evening’s final game.

Full time: South Korea 2-3 Ghana
--------------------------------

**Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeep!**The ball goes out for another [South Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/southkorea) corner but Anthony Taylor blows for full time before they can take it. He’s immediately surrounded by irate South Koreans, all of them apparently oblivious to the fact that the 12 corners they’ve already taken have been truly dreadful.

**89 min:** Into the knockings we go but one imagines there’ll be plenty of added time given all the subsitutions, goal celebrations and a couple of significant breaks in play for treatment to injured players.

**83 min:** Chance! Not for the first time in recent minutes, [South Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/southkorea) left-back Kim Jun-su misses a decent scoring opportunity, shooting high over the bar when he had plenty of goal to aim at.

The [South Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/southkorea) defender swung his boot and got plenty of shin but no ball and might consider himself lucky.

**67 min:** “I do enjoy how much more animated Dion Dublin gets about a No9 scoring a header than he does about anything else in football,” writes Nath Jones. Yup, Dion is on BBC co-comms for this game and has been very animated for the past few minutes. As anyone who watches H|omes Under The Hammer will know, the only thing that gets him more excited than No9s scoring headers are houses with “stairs up to the bedroom”.

**64 min:** There’s been a break in play so Hwang In-beom can receive treatment for a head wound. He’s spilling claret and goes to the touchline for a few staples or stitches. His team soldier on with 10 men for the time being.

**62 min:** That’s an astonishing comeback from [South Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/southkorea), who score two goals in three minutes, with both coming from Cho Gue-sung headers to convert crosses from the left. Ghana were powerless to stop his second, as he got the run on Moahmmed Salisu and Gideon Mensah, who could only look on helplessly as he outjumped them.

**60 min:** An inspired bit of touchline management from Paulo Bento, whose decision to send on Lee pays immediate dividends. The substitute picks Tariq Lamptey’s pocket out on the left touchline and sends in a terrific cross. Jo was on hand to score with a header from the edge of the six-yard box.

**54 min:** Andre Ayew canters down the inside left and tries to play a ball inside to Inaki Williams. It’s intercepted by Kim Jun-su, who puts the ball out for a corner. Jordan Ayew’s delivery is put out for a corner by Jung Woo-young, who comes perilously close to flicking his near post defensive header past his own goalkeeper. Nothing comes of the resulting corner.

**Son’s terrible corner kicks.** “He’s really been struggling with these, not been able to produce a decent corner in ages,” writes Richard Prasad. “None of the ones he’s taken today barely reached the near end of the six-yard box. But it’s been that way for a while - with Tottenham and in the warmup match against Cameroon in Seoul in September. Yet in that time he’s done pretty well with free kicks. I think that Kang-in Lee takes corners, etc for his team in Spain, but doesn’t get any with the national team for some reason.” The reason today possibly being that he is currently on the bench.

**Ghana’s first goal.** Some clarification: While there is no doubt the ball hit Andre Ayew’s arm on its way into the [South Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/southkorea) penalty area, the goal stood because it was not him who scored it. If he had turned the ball home it would almost certainly have been disallowed.

**Half-time musings:** It’s been an entertaining, if slightly odd game. Ghana were seriously under the cosh for the first 23 minutes, conceding corner after corner after corner, all of which were wasted by [South Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/southkorea).

Their opener came against the run of play and courtesy of an excellent dead ball delivery into the South Korea penalty area which was eventually converted by Mohammed Salisu. A whipped Ayew cross 10 minutes later needed only the faintest of touches from Mohammed Kudus to double the African side’s lead.

Half-time: South Korea 0-2 Ghana
--------------------------------

**Peep!** The teams troupe off for their half-time refreshments, with Ghana two goals to the good. Jordan Ayew provided the assists for both, his crosses into the [South Korea](https://www.theguardian.com/football/southkorea) penalty area being converted by Mohammed Salisu and Mohammed Kudus.

**45+5 min:** Ghana win a corner and Jordan Ayew’s delivery is outstanding this time. The inswinging ball threatens to drop under the cross-bar but is put over by a combination of Kim Seung-gyu’s glove and Thomas Partey’s shoulder.

**45+2 min:** We’re into five minutes of added time and Ghana have their first corner of the game. Jordan Ayew, already the assist-provider for both his team’s goals, channels his inner Son Heung-min and fails to clear the first defender, who heads away at the near post.
