# Mexico vs Poland final score, result: Memo Ochoa extends Robert Lewandowski's World Cup frustration

Mexico and Poland both missed the chance to exploit [Argentina's shock defeat by Saudi Arabia](https://web.archive.org/web/20221127014206/https://www.sportingnews.com/us/soccer/news/argentina-vs-saudi-arabia-world-cup-live-score-result/guldh6njdecvphcvfjki22ze) as their opening World Cup 2022 Group C encounter ended goalless.

Gerardo Martino's side had the bulk of possession and the better chances overall, but Poland might have sneaked victory only for star striker Robert Lewandowski to miss a second-half penalty.

The Barcelona forward won the penalty after a tussle with Hector Moreno in the box which went to a VAR review, but his weak spot-kick was saved by veteran Mexican goalkeeper Guillermo "Memo" Ochoa, who became only the eighth player — and fourth Mexican — to play at five World Cups.

Lewandowski remains without a goal at a World Cup but in truth Poland did little to merit victory, preferring a policy of containment.

> 0 - Robert Lewandowski has failed to score in any of his four games for Poland 🇵🇱 at the World Cup, failing with all 11 shots he has attempted in the tournament (4 on target). Strange. [pic.twitter.com/98OQ1mJTPz](https://web.archive.org/web/20221127014206/https://t.co/98OQ1mJTPz)

Mexico had first-half chances via Alexis Vega's header and the dangerous Jesus Gallardo, while Poland goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny also did well to palm away a header from Henry Martin after the break.

El Tri will move on to face Argentina, humbled by Saudi Arabia earlier, on Saturday, while Poland next tackle the Green Falcons.

Mexico vs Poland live updates, highlights from 2022 World Cup
-------------------------------------------------------------

**FULL-TIME: Mexico 0-0 Poland**

A missed opportunity for both teams, in a sense. Mexico looked the better side for most of the match, but couldn't convert any of their chances. Poland only had one of note, but the great Robert Lewandowski's poor penalty - which could have stolen victory - was saved by Guillermo Ochoa.

Saudi Arabia are the leaders of Group C after the opening round of matches!

**96th min:**Poland break forward and Grzegorz Krychowiak lines up a long-ranger, 25 yards out, but it's always going over.

**94th min:**Will there be a final chance for either side? Both are looking pretty tired now.

**90th min:**There'll be SEVEN minutes of added time. Where do they find it all from?

**87th min:**Poland also making a late substitution, Juventus forward Arkadiusz Milik replacing Piotr Zielinski.

**84th min:**Mexico send on Uriel Antuna for Alexis Vega, who has toiled away tirelessly without reward.

**82nd min:**Back to the matter at hand. Raul Jimenez breaks into the Poland penalty area but the Wolves striker's touch lets him down just as he looks set to pull the trigger.

**77th min:** NEWSFLASH: Manchester United have just announced that Cristiano Ronaldo is to leave the club "by mutual agreement, with immediate effect". They have thanked him for his "immense contribution across two spells at Old Trafford".

**MORE:[Ronaldo's contract termination explained: When can he join his next club?](https://web.archive.org/web/20221127014206/https://www.sportingnews.com/us/soccer/news/cristiano-ronaldo-contract-termination-man-united-new-club/k7uiij16zt6qshvbaa36jmvw)**

**75th min:**So 15 minutes left of normal time - plus at least another five minutes if the rest of the tournament so far is anything to go by - in this Group C encounter. Can either side fashion a winner or are we going to have our second goalless draw of the day.

**72nd min:** Poland also making a change, bringing on midfielder Przemyslaw Frankowski for Sebastian Szymanski.

**70th min:** Double change for Mexico. Striker Raul Jimenez, who has struggled for fitness in recent months, and Charly Rodriguez are on, replacing Henry Martin and Hector Herrera.

**64th min:**Chance for Mexico!Kevin Alvarez curls in a cross from the left that Henry Martin heads goalwards, but Wojciech Szczesny is equal to it and dives to his left to palm it away.

**60th min:**That's certainly energised the crowd, with Mexico's fans celebrating like they've won the World Cup.

**57th min: SAVED!**Robert Lewandowski pushes his kick to the right, but Guillermo Ochoa, winning his 137th cap, dives to his left to keep it out.Lewandowski still searching for his first World Cup goal.

**54th min:**Hector Moreno and Robert Lewandowski jostling in the box. Both players going hard for the ball and pulling each other's jerseys. Possible penalty? It's gone to VAR.

**52nd min:**Similar pattern to the first half so far. Mexico doing most of the pressing, Poland - who have had one solitary attempt on goal - content with containment.

**46th min:** We're back underway at Stadium 974. Poland have made a half-time substitution, bringing on Birmingham City's Krystian Bielik for Roma youngster Nicola Zalewski.

**HALF-TIME: Mexico 0-0 Poland**

Mexico the better side and they have had a few half-chances, but Poland are holding firm. Let's hope for goals in the second half...Mexico's last 12 at World Cups have all come in the second half, incidentally.

**45th min**: We'll have two minutes of added time...

**44th min**:Hirving Lozano attempts a one-two on the edge of the box before going to ground. The ball falls for the overlapping Jorge Sanchez, who forces Wojciech Szczesny to tip his effort over the bar.

**39th min:**A teasing ball in from the left from Mexico's Luis Chavez eludes several of team-mates in the area. Hirving Lozano puts in back in the mixer, but Poland clear. El Tri doing all the pressing, but chances still at a premium.

**37th min:** Important bit of history being made at this match today, by the way.

**33rd min:**Poland are quite happy to sit deep in a defensive block and let Mexico try to break them down. Bit of a tactical stalemate at the moment after a drop in the early energy levels.

**30th min:**Saudi Arabia, incidentally, has apparently declared a national holiday tomorrow after their sensational victory over Argentina in this group earlier. And why not.

**28th min:**Another half-chance for Mexico as Jesus Gallardo gets a toe to a through ball ahead of Poland keeper Wojciech Szczesny, who gets half a hand on it before his defenders bail him out at the cost of a corner.

**26th min:** Best chance of the game so far. Mexico's Alexis Vega gets a decent head on a cross from the right, but can only steer his effort wide of the right post.

**23rd min:**Robert Lewandowski goes to ground on the edge of the area after a coming together with Mexico defender Cesar Montes, but there's nothing doing there.

**21st min:** Mexico have reached the last 16 in all of the last seven World Cups since 1994, but never gone any further. Could this be the tournament where go one step further? It's been a decent start from El Tri.

**17th min:**Hirving Lozano looks a threat for Mexico and he tries a one-two on the edge of the box, but the overlapping Jorge Sanchez is flagged offside.

**12th min:**Good pace and vibrancy to this encounter early on. From a corner, Mexico whip a curling ball in from the left but central defender Hector Moreno can't keep his header down.

**8th min:**A lovely pass from Robert Lewandowski puts Poland on the attack but Mexico defender Jesus Gallardo gets back to clear the danger and concede a corner, which comes to nothing.

**5th min:** Mistake from Poland allows Mexico to spring Hirving Lozano down the right. The Napoli striker whips in a ball right across the face of goal,but Alexis Vega - arriving at the far post - can't quite get on the end of it.

**1st min:**Mexico kick off. Big opportunity for both of these teams after [Argentina's stunning loss to Saudi Arabia](https://web.archive.org/web/20221127014206/https://www.sportingnews.com/uk/soccer/news/argentina-vs-saudi-arabia-world-cup-live-score-result/guldh6njdecvphcvfjki22ze) earlier blew this Group C wide open.

**3 mins from kickoff:** It's anthems time at Stadium 974. We'll be underway shortly.

**3hrs 30mins from kickoff:** Well, well, well. Things in Group C just got a whole lot more interesting for Mexico and Poland thanks to events elsewhere in Qatar, and there is now even more on the line for this match!

**4hrs 30mins from kickoff:**We're still a few hours from kickoff in this one, but the preparations are well underway. In fact, for both sides this is the next step in what has already been a long journey to the finals. Mexico finished second in CONCACAF qualifying behind Canada, while Poland had to come through a UEFA playoff to book their spot. Now, though, it's all about the small details— which could make all the difference today!

**5 hrs from kickoff:** It's Mexico's turn to get their Qatar 2022 campaign underway today, and they do so against the substantial threat of Poland and one Robert Lewandowski. If they start positively, could this, at long last, be the year they get beyond the Round of 16?

Mexico vs Poland confirmed lineups
----------------------------------

Jesus 'Tecatito' Corona's absence is a blow to Gerardo Martino's plans, with the Sevilla forward having played a key role in their qualification to the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

His starting place is likely to be taken by **Alexis Vega**, in an altered 4-3-3 system, with Martino able to rely on some crucial experience elsewhere in his squad through **Guillermo Ochoa**, **Nestor Araujo** and **Jesus Gallardo**.

Wolves star **Jimenez**will be a threat off the bench with Ajax star**Edson Alvarez**worth keeping an eye on midfield.

**Mexico (4-3-3, right to left): 13. Ochoa (GK) — 19. Sanchez, 15. Moreno, 3. Montes, 23.Gallardo — 4. Alvarez, 16. Herrera, 24. Chavez — 10. Vega, 22. Lozano, 20. Martin**

Poland's two key players stood up and made the difference in their 2022 World Cup playoff win over Sweden back in March, with **Robert****Lewandowski** and **Piotr Zielinski** both on target in a 2-0 win.

Coach Czeslaw Michniewicz switched between tactical formations during their UEFA Nations League campaign and he has tweaked to a 4-2-3-1 today, with Lewandowski as the focal point.

**Poland (4-2-3-1 right to left): 1. Szczesny (GK) — 2. Cash, 14. Kiwior, 15. Gilik, 18. Berezynski — 13. Kaminski, 10. Krychowiak — 21. Zalewski, 20. Zielinski, 19. Szymanski — 9. Lewandowski**
