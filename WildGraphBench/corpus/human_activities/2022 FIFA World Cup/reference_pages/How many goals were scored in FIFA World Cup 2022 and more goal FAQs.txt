It has to be noted here that the goals in a penalty shootout are not considered goals while calculating goals after the tournament. They are deciders only for the result of the match.

That is why Gonzalo Montiel’s final strike in the shootout is not considered the last goal of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

**Who scored the most goals in the FIFA World Cup 2022?**

Kylian Mbappe, the France forward won the Golden Boot for scoring the most goals in the FIFA World Cup 2022 in Qatar. Lionel Messi finished second with seven goals, while his compatriot Julian Alvarez and Frenchman Olivier Giroud finished third.
