Lionel Messi is hoping to secure the trophy that would cement his status as perhaps the game's greatest ever player. The 35-year-old will bow out on the global stage backed by a soccer-mad country that has sent legions of fans to the Middle East.

Kylian Mbappé could solidify his claim as the young pretender to Messi's throne if the speedy and skillful forward can help France become the first team to go back-to-back since Brazil in 1962.

Both countries are aiming for a third title on Fox, Telemundo or [Peacock](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650/https://www.peacocktv.com/).

Argentina thwarts France in thrilling World Cup final
-----------------------------------------------------

[Doha Madani](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650/https://www.nbcnews.com/author/doha-madani-ncpn915866)

Argentina has defeated France, the returning champion, in a dramatic match that gives the South American country its first title since 1978.

Sunday's final was a battle of wills as the competitors met each other shot for shot well into extra time, until Argentina ended France's hope for a consecutive win in penalty kicks.

Argentina took an early lead, scoring two goals in the first half. France was thoroughly outplayed and was consistently on the defensive but rallied in the second half and in extra time.

Lionel Messi, Argentina's captain, has taken his first World Cup title in what is likely to be the 35-year-old's last appearance in the tournament. He solidified an incredible legacy as fans debate whether Messi is the greatest player of all time.

But he met his match in Kylian Mbappé, France's young upstart, who tied the game twice. The 23-year-old scored three goals in addition to a penalty kick, earning him the Golden Boot.

Mbappé only second player to hat trick in World Cup final
---------------------------------------------------------

[Doha Madani](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650/https://www.nbcnews.com/author/doha-madani-ncpn915866)

France's Kylian Mbappé is the first player in more than 50 years to successfully score three goals in a World Cup final.

The 23-year-old scored two back-to-back goals at 80 minutes to tie the game after an early deficit for France. Mbappé once again saved Les Bleus chances with a penalty kick goal.

England's Geoff Hurst was previously the only player to ever score a hat trick in a World Cup final. The striker was only 24 when he made history against West Germany in 1966.

World Cup to be won on penalties
--------------------------------

[Doha Madani](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650/https://www.nbcnews.com/author/doha-madani-ncpn915866)

The 2022 World Cup final will be decided on penalty kicks after Argentina and France could not be separated at the end of extra time.

The shootout will bring back bitter memories for French fans, as the last World Cup to be decided by penalties was France's 2006 loss to Italy. Argentina may have a slight edge, having just won a quarter final in a shootout against the Netherlands.

Both teams have scored penalties in the game, adding an extra layer of intrigue to the decisive shootout.

First Argentina goalie Emi Martinez thwarts France with an incredible save, then Argentina pours forward and Lautaro Martinez heads wide.

We have 3 more minutes of a truly stunning final. Can someone win it before penalty kicks?

English-language viewers will probably have to change channels if they want to see the World Cup trophy presentation.

With 1 p.m. EST NFL kickoffs approaching, post-match action from Qatar will likely shift from Fox to Fox Sports 1.

It's 3-3. Kylian Mbappé scores again and we are tied!

The French forward sent the goalie the wrong way and has a hat-trick in the World Cup final.

Max Burman

Lionel Messi has the ball in the net, and Argentina's players go wild.

There were suggestions of a potential offside in the build up but the goal stands and Argentina leads this dramatic World Cup final 3-2 with 10 minutes of extra time to go.

Max Burman

Argentina came close with a flurry of chances to end the first period of extra time.

Substitute forward Lautaro Martinez was twice played in behind the French line but missed thanks to a combination of desperate defending and wayward finishing.

Penalty kicks will follow if no winner after extra time

[Doha Madani](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650/https://www.nbcnews.com/author/doha-madani-ncpn915866)

France and Argentina will be given an additional two halves of 15 minutes to decide this final, but the match will go to penalty kicks if there's no winner after that.

The last World Cup final decided by a shootout was in 2006, when France lost to Italy.

The Argentine forward may be 35, but he still has enough left in the tank to come oh so close to glory in the dying moments.

After consistent French pressure, a rare Argentina attack in the 96th minute saw the ball fall to Messi in a central position about 25 yards out. He struck a fierce shot that was just a little too close to French goalie Hugo Lloris, who parried it away to ensure we would head to extra time.

90 minutes not enough to crown World Cup winner
-----------------------------------------------

[David K. Li](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650/https://www.nbcnews.com/author/david-k-li-ncpn915856)

France and Argentina are headed for at least 30 more minutes of play with the score tied, 2-2.

Extra time in the World Cup final is far from uncommon, as Germany needed more than 90 minutes to defeat Argentina, 1-0, [for the 2014 crown](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650/https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/world-cup/germany-triumphs-over-argentina-world-cup-final-n154836) in Brazil. Mario Götze scored in the 114th minute for the Germans.

The officials have added 8 minutes on at the end here.

Is there time for one last dramatic twist or are we heading for an extra 30?

Argentina gives up lead, echoing mistakes in Netherlands game
-------------------------------------------------------------

[Doha Madani](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650/https://www.nbcnews.com/author/doha-madani-ncpn915866)

Soccer fans are in disbelief as France rallied from 2-0 goal deficit with back-to-back goals from Kylian Mbappé at about 80 minutes of play.

Argentina is echoing recent mistakes made in the game against the Netherlands earlier in the tournament. The Dutch team equalized the game with two late goals in the quarter-finals. Argentina scraped a win on penalty kicks to advance into the semifinals.

France's comeback was unlikely after giving up so much of the momentum to Argentina early in the game but clearly not impossible.

Max Burman

Incredible. Kylian Mbappé has scored again, a second goal in 2 minutes.

A remarkable turnaround from the reigning champs, barely threatening for 80 minutes but suddenly bursting into life to level the final and stun Argentina.

[David K. Li](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650/https://www.nbcnews.com/author/david-k-li-ncpn915856)

The French captain has made four saves for Les Bleus, limiting what could be an even more one-sided match.

On the other side of the pitch, Argentina's Emiliano Martínez has not yet needed to stop an on-target French shot.

Max Burman

France has a golden chance to get back in the final!

Nicolas Otamendi brought down Randal Kolo Muani inside the area, and after failing to threaten for 80 minutes, the holders have a chance.

France finally takes a shot on goal after an hour of play
---------------------------------------------------------

[Doha Madani](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650/https://www.nbcnews.com/author/doha-madani-ncpn915866)

Kylian Mbappé took the first shot on goal for France at the 70-minute mark of Sunday's final match.

Les Bleus are being devastated by the Argentine team, which has taken nine shots on goal and leads the scoreboard 2-0. It's been an abysmal attempt to keep the title of reigning champions from France despite a strong defense and a lineup of stars.

Julián Álvarez's left-footed blast from a short angle was saved nicely by Hugo Lloris in the 59th minute.

Then moments later, the French captain made a desperate, sliding clearance to keep the ball away from Alexis Mac Allister and what could have been another goal for Argentina.

Argentina eases its attack, plays keep away from France
-------------------------------------------------------

[Doha Madani](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650/https://www.nbcnews.com/author/doha-madani-ncpn915866)

In a big shift in tactics, Argentina came into the second half taking its time as it looks to secure its lead without exhausting its players.

The team came back after the break and appeared to be slowing down the pace of play. With a 2-0 lead, Argentina is looking to keep possession away from France but without the pressure it previously applied.

France had to come back with a more aggressive offensive than it applied at the beginning of the match. All eyes were on Kylian Mbappé, an upstart young player who has quickly become a household name to soccer fans.

But Mbappé, 23, hasn't shown the powerhouse attacks that have made him a French favorite.

France not making much headway into Argentina defense

[David K. Li](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650/https://www.nbcnews.com/author/david-k-li-ncpn915856)

Twelve minutes into the second half, Les Bleus have barely made a dent into Argentina's stout defense.

Argentina still holds a solid advantage in possession, holding on to the ball 47% of the time, compared to France's 37%.

This 2-0 deficit is looking more mountainous by the moment.

Was it a penalty kick? Referee's call draws scrutiny
----------------------------------------------------

![Image 79: A 60x60 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650im_/https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_28/2929096/190612-max_burman_-byline-30782.jpg)

Polish referee Szymon Marciniak wasted no time pointing to the spot when Angel Di Maria went down under the challenge of Ousmane Dembele midway through the half.

There appeared to be minimal contact, but the Video Assistant Referee saw nothing worthy of overturning the call. It will be scrutinized long after the game is over, but France has failed to perform regardless of the merits of the decision.

Argentina is 45 minutes, and maybe a few more, from glory.

France needs to turn things around to overcome the 2-goal hole it's left itself in.

Only one team has ever rallied from a two-goal deficit in World Cup final history, and that was staged by a country that's no longer on the map.

In a match [known as the "Miracle of Bern,"](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650/https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/1954switzerland) Hungary scored twice in the first eight minutes before West Germany came back for a 3-2 victory in the 1954 final played in the Swiss capital.

France's mountain will be much more steep that West Germany's in _"Das Wunder von Bern"_ as the underdogs responded immediately with two goals that had the match tied at halftime.

Helmut Rahn [scored the winne](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650/https://www.nbcsports.com/bayarea/fifa-world-cup-winners-year)r in the 84th minute.

Argentina's second was a thrilling goal that saw them sweep forward at pace, exposing France's defense with pinpoint passes from Messi and others.

The inclusion of Angel Di Maria for Argentina was a slight surprise, but he won the penalty and then converted the second to justify coach Lionel Scaloni's big call.

Reigning champs outplayed
-------------------------

[Doha Madani](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650/https://www.nbcnews.com/author/doha-madani-ncpn915866)

Though France came in as the World Cup's reigning champions, they failed to show up in the first half against Argentina.

The French team has shown a strong defense throughout the tournament and sought to pick its moments to attack. But cracks showed in the goals from Lionel Messi and Angel Di Maria, and with the defense under pressure France's attack has failed to fire.

Argentina has 6 shots to 0 from Les Bleus, who will have to come out of halftime with a more aggressive game if they plan to overcome the deficit.

Struggling France makes early subs

Max Burman

France has barely had a kick so far, and now coach Didier Deschamps has made a pair of changes just before half time.

Center forward Olivier Giroud and wide forward Ousmane Dembele have been replaced by Marcus Thuram and Randal Kolo Muani, who scored in the semi final.

It's surprisingly early to make drastic changes but France needs to shift things, and there were reports of players being struck by a cold virus and some injuries in the past week.

It's 2-0!

Argentina burst through the French defense with a sweeping move on the counterattack and Angel Di Maria lifts his finish past helpless French goalie Hugo Lloris to double his side's lead.

Argentina has a penalty after Angel Di Maria was tripped inside the box by a French defender. A chance for Lionel Messi to give his team the lead...

France fails to take lead with free kick
----------------------------------------

[Doha Madani](https://web.archive.org/web/20221218180650/https://www.nbcnews.com/author/doha-madani-ncpn915866)

France squandered the opportunity to take the advantage early on after being given a free kick just before the match hit the 20 minute mark.

The kick, taken by Antoine Griezmann, sailed toward Argentina's box where Olivier Giroud attempted to assist the ball into the net.

Unfortunately for the French, the bail sailed well over the net.
