AL KHOR, Qatar — This is how fine the margins can be: As the first bout between heavyweights of this World Cup ticked into injury time on Sunday, Álvaro Morata of Spain found himself cantering into the penalty area, the ball at his feet, goalkeeper Manuel Neuer’s net looming ever larger in his vision. Behind him, Nico Schlotterbeck of Germany was straining to close ground.

There were, at that point, two possible outcomes for Germany. They were separated in the moment only by a heartbeat, a blink of an eye, a blade of grass. But they carried with them two destinies that were not just distinct, but worlds apart. It was not just Germany’s hope of reaching the knockout rounds that hung in the balance, but estimations of its soccer culture, the international careers of its players and possibly the continuing employment of its manager.

In one outcome, Schlotterbeck would not make it back. Having already scored for Spain, Morata would take a touch to set himself, then send another shot careening past Neuer. Germany would lose its first two games at this tournament. The grumbling since Germany’s 2-1 loss to Japan on Wednesday would resume.

Germany Coach Hansi Flick’s team would head into its final match on Thursday, against Costa Rica, knowing its fate was not in its own hands, aware that it was flirting with the humiliation of being eliminated from the World Cup at the first hurdle for a second consecutive tournament. The players involved would carry the stigma with them for some time. Several international careers would end in ignominy. Flick could lose his job.

In the other outcome, Schlotterbeck would get there, hooking his foot around the ball and stealing it from Morata’s grasp. Germany would retain the point it had earned through a thunderous equalizer in the 83rd minute from Niclas Füllkrug, who was making just his third appearance for his country, at age 29, and with that point some measure of control over its fate.

Now, a mere victory against Costa Rica on Thursday would, in all likelihood, mean safe passage through not just to the last 16 from an awkward group draw, but to what must feel like an overdue stroke of good fortune: a tie not against another powerhouse but a relative outsider, Morocco or an aging Croatia, and a reasonable shot at a place in the quarterfinals.

The absurdity of such starkly opposing consequences is apparent. Germany’s performance would have been almost exactly the same whether Schlotterbeck made that tackle or not; it was, after all, just one incident among many hundreds over the course of some 100 minutes, one decision among thousands.

Had he failed to get there, it would not have been because of some fatal flaw in how Germany develops talent. It would not even, really, have been proof of a grand tactical failing on Flick’s part, or evidence that the atmosphere among the players had grown irretrievably toxic, or a rational basis on which to terminate someone’s employment.

It would not have rendered everything Germany had done over the previous couple of hours irrelevant: enduring Spain’s slick, irresistible start, when Dani Olmo cracked a shot off the crossbar and Pedri and Gavi, Barcelona’s seraphic midfielders, clipped the ball around as though it was their personal possession; slowly establishing a foothold in the game; finding ways to menace a Spanish team that had looked powerful just a few days before.

The last few days have been difficult for Germany. There have been, as Kai Havertz said before the game, more than a handful of frank exchanges of views among the players and the coaching staff. Midfielder Ilkay Gundogan, a contemplative, even-keel sort of a person, admitted afterward that it had taken him a little while to process defeat against Japan in the opening game. “The day after, even the day after that, was still difficult,” he said.

And yet even when Morata’s inventive finish gave Spain the lead in the 62nd minute, sucking the air from Germany’s fans, bringing a reprise of the nightmare of 2018 within view, Gundogan and his teammates retained their cool. They did not seem haunted, panicked or desperate. They did not look like a team in the grip of an identity crisis.

Instead, they played with a maturity that offers considerable hope. Jamal Musiala, the brightest of their young generation, might have scored; Füllkrug, regarded almost as an accidental international, a sign of the shortcomings in the German system, was rather less forgiving.

That is not to say it was spectacular — far from it — but it was full of all of those other traits that are considered quite useful in these circumstances, grit and fight and industry and common sense, all the ingredients teams need not just to recover from setbacks but to go on to greater things.

And then came that moment, when Schlotterbeck hurried back toward his goal, when Morata waited to pounce, and everything hung on the line. The slightest error, the slightest pause, and it might all have been over: Germany would have been left relying on Spain’s good graces to make it to the last 16.

Schlotterbeck made the tackle, of course, bundling the ball out for a corner, jumping to his feet and pumping his arms, his face a mask of fury, as though he had scored the winning goal instead of preserving a 1-1 tie. Perhaps he knew quite how much was riding on that one moment, all the conclusions and assessments and decisions that rested on his pace, his timing, his judgment.

In that moment, as Morata shaped to shoot, Germany’s journey in Qatar hung by a thread. None of the encouraging signs it had offered would have mattered in the slightest if he had not gotten there. There tend, sadly, to be no mitigating circumstances in failure. The margins might be fine, but the realities that emerge as a consequence are diametrically opposed.

One outcome was nothing but darkness descending, the walls closing in. Fortunately, Germany finds itself in the other, where there may even be a kindly last 16 draw, a chance of a quarterfinal, an opportunity to slay ghosts and, perhaps, seek glory. Germany has confronted its gloom. Now, after a tense, forlorn week, it can see hope once more.

Germany, I think, deserves that. Musiala should certainly have drawn his team level a few minutes earlier — Füllkrug might have done — and Flick’s team overall has stood up well to Spain. Germany might not have looked great so far in this tournament, but its destiny is now likely in its hands — a win against Costa Rica should send it through — and then the draw opens up quite kindly thanks to the chaos in Group F. As things stand, it would be facing a last 16 game against Morocco. The Germans would probably have taken that after defeat to Japan.

GOAL! Morata scores for Spain, and it’s 1-0. That was a lovely team goal from Spain: a series of confident but simple passes swept through the midfield, crossed the pitch and sent Jordi Alba down the left. He drives a cross to the near post, and Morata is first to it — slamming it past Neuer at the near post.

There’s always a danger of reading a little too much into the results of the opening round of group games. Where would the fun be if we didn’t?

Spain has had the better of the chances here, with Dani Olmo hitting the crossbar, and dominated much of the play, but Germany has proved to be considerably more redoubtable opposition than anticipated. Hansi Flick has clearly told his team to bide its time and wait for its moment. It might not be the most thrilling viewing, but it is just what the Germans need.

A point would mean beating Costa Rica in its final group game would almost certainly be enough to qualify. And that, ultimately, is the general purpose of the whole activity.

Germany’s players spent the day after their defeat to Japan having what might be best described as a full and frank exchange of views. They were not, at times, especially “nice” to each other, as Kai Havertz put it. (He’s been dropped, so it’s been especially un-nice for him.) It does seem to have had an impact, though: This has been a far more evenly balanced 20 minutes than we were, perhaps, anticipating.

Given that this is by some distance the most appealing game of the group stage, in terms of the historic significance of the two countries, the stadium at Al Bayt has a surprising number of empty seats. Hopefully it will fill up a little more, but at this point the working theory has to be that if a game does not involve a team from Latin America or the Middle East/North Africa, the crowd will be disappointing.

The last time Germany faced Spain, it came away with a 6-0 defeat. That, admittedly, is not a great augury for this game, but on paper, at least, the gap between these two teams isn’t quite such a chasm. There is plenty of experience in Germany’s midfield, in the shape of the Manchester City captain Ilkay Gundogan and the Bayern Munich duo of Leon Goretzka and Joshua Kimmich; the question is whether it is sufficient to contain Pedri and Gavi, Spain’s twin phenoms.

Germany has made two changes to its team for its game against Spain, the biggest being the dropping of Kai Havertz in favor of Leon Goretzka.

Goretzka, a sturdy midfielder, is a very different play than Havertz, a striker, so his insertion is more than a one-for-one swap. But it also adds a bit of familiarity to Germany’s front six: five of the players are Bayern Munich teammates (Manchester City’s Ilkay Gundogan is the odd man … in?)

Germany’s second change is on defense, where Thilo Kehrer replaces the 22-year-old Nico Schlotterbeck.

**Germany’s lineup:**

Manuel Neuer; Thilo Kehrer, Niklas Süle, Antonio Rüdiger, David Raum; Joshua Kimmich, Ilkay Gundogan, Leon Goretzka; Thomas Müller, Serge Gnabry, Jamal Musiala

Spain makes only one change to the team that thrashed Costa Rica in the opener: bringing in Dani Carvajal for Cesar Azpilicueta at right back.

**Spain’s lineup:**

Unai Simon; Dani Carvajal, Rodri, Aymeric Laporte, Jordi Alba; Sergio Busquets, Gavi, Pedri; Ferran Torres, Marco Asensio, Dani Olmo

If there is any team in the World Cup that should be flying high right now, it is Spain.

The Spanish poured in goals against Costa Rica in their opener, [winning by 7-0](https://web.archive.org/web/20221228142612/https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/11/23/sports/world-cup-scores?smid=url-share#spain-vs-costa-rica-will-the-upsets-in-group-e-continue-follow-live), and on Sunday are facing a Germany team reeling from [an opening defeat to Japan](https://web.archive.org/web/20221228142612/https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/23/sports/soccer/germany-japan-upset-world-cup-score.html). But before anyone could go too far in predicting a walkover over _Germany_, Spain Coach Luis Enrique was pumping the brakes.

“It’s a big test for us,” Enrique told reporters on Saturday. “In such an important event like this, against one of the favorites to win the World Cup, in a complicated situation for them, we want to show that we will not play differently, and that we will try to dominate from the start. And if it works, fantastic. If not, we will congratulate our rival.”

Part of his caution may be based in tactics: Luis Enrique called Germany the one team in the tournament that most resembles Spain. And while he played down his team’s lack of experience in critical spots — Spain’s midfield is run by Pedri, 20, and Gavi, 18 — he also knows his youngest stars have never been in a game with Sunday’s kind of stakes before.

“Against a team like Germany, we can’t be overconfident,” he said. “Otherwise, they will trounce you.”

There can be no debate about the identity of the player who has contributed the most to Germany’s World Cup campaign so far: Keysher Fuller, scorer of the goal that [allowed Costa Rica to beat Japan](https://web.archive.org/web/20221228142612/https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/11/27/sports/world-cup-scores/japan-faces-a-humbled-costa-rica-as-it-seeks-a-spot-in-the-second-round?smid=url-share) and, for now at least, spare Germany’s blushes.

For four days, Germany has been staring down the barrel of a second straight humiliation at this tournament. Under Joachim Löw, it was eliminated after the group stage in 2018 as reigning champion. Losing to Japan in its opening game here meant that his former assistant, and now his successor, Hansi Flick, seemed destined to suffer the same fate: Germany’s second game was against an imperious Spain, and defeat would leave it with scant, if any, hope of surviving into the tournament’s second week.

Fuller’s goal did not solve all of the problems plaguing this German team: an imbalanced squad, one that contains plenty of young promise and an abundance of experience but precious little in between; one that does not have a clear idea of how it wants to play, or what sort of team it wants to be; one that displayed against Japan a worryingly soft center.

But it does have a lifeline now. This group has become, in effect, a contest to see who can lose to Spain by the fewest goals. Costa Rica conceded seven. Germany must seek to limit the damage, and then hope that the Spanish run riot against Japan, too. It is not the most glorious way to progress. But at this stage, Germany has little choice but to accept it.

Costa Rica

Keysher Fuller (81’)

Costa Rica made the most of its first shot on goal in this World Cup, scoring on it to beat Japan, 1-0. The victory revives its slim chances of advancing to the next round, puts Japan in the very difficult spot of needing to beat Spain to continue and offers Germany a lifeline.

Japan had controlled the game until the 81st minute, when it gave the ball away to Keysher Fuller, who fired a shot past the fingers of Shuichi Gonda and into the upper right corner of the net.

The result stunned Japan and ended the momentum it was riding after its upset of Germany last week. Japan will need to beat Spain, one of the tournament’s favorites, later this week to advance. The Costa Ricans also did the Germans a huge favor. It cannot be eliminated with a tie or even a loss against Spain and can even win the group with victories in its next two games.

Here’s what to know:

*   At no point in the game did Costa Rica look like it was going to score a goal. Until it did. Japan had more shots, 14, versus Costa Rica’s four, and possessed the ball for 47 percent of the game. Costa Rica held on to the ball for just 38 percent of the match.

*   Japan might have been doomed from the start, when its manager, Hajime Moriyasu, rejiggered the starters against Costa Rica, putting Takuma Asano, who scored the game winner against Germany, on the bench. Moriyasu brought Asano in to start the second half, sparking a relentless assault on Costa Rica’s goal.

*   The Blue Samurais then took control of the game after a very dull first half from both teams. Japan had one of its best chances in the 70th minute when Costa Rica’s Francisco Calvo fouled a Japanese player right outside the penalty box, earning Japan a free kick. Daichi Kamada missed his attempt.

*   Both teams have to worry about how aggressively they can play in their final match, after they both racked up three yellow cards on Sunday. It’s especially troubling for Costa Rica, whose two strikers, Joel Campbell and Anthony Contreras, have one each.
