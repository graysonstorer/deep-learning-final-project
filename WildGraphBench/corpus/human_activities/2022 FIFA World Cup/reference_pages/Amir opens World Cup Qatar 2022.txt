HH the Amir added, “Starting from this evening, and for a period of twenty-eight days, we will follow, and with us the whole world, God willing, the great football festival, in this spacious ambience for human and civilized communication.”

People of different races, nationalities, faiths and orientations will gather here in Qatar, and around screens on all continents to share the same exciting moments.

How beautiful it is for people to put aside what divides them in order to celebrate their diversity and what brings them together at the same time.

“I wish all the participating teams a magnificent football performance, high sportsmanship, and a time full of joy, excitement and delight for you all. And let there be days that are inspiring with goodness and hope,” HH the Amir added.

The ceremony began with cultural performances presenting important aspects of the history of the State of Qatar and the Arab countries in celebrating and honoring the guests, in a symbolic sign of Qatar welcoming fans from around the world.

The ceremony also included videos about the marine and terrestrial culture that distinguished the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula, and their communication with the world through the sea.
