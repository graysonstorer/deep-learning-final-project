# FIFA World Cup begins with the first-ever Quran recitation, but why did Morgan Freeman wear a glove?

Qatar's opening ceremony on Sunday has been the talk of the town. The event was begun by the country’s Emir (monarch), who, after kissing his father's hand, welcomed everyone to the biggest football tournament of the year. This is the first-ever World Cup being held in the Middle East, reported [Khaleej Times](https://www.khaleejtimes.com/fifa-world-cup/fifa-world-cup-2022-look-how-qatar-welcomes-the-football-fans-with-quran-recitation?_refresh=true).

"From Qatar, from the Arab world, I welcome everyone to the World Cup 2022," Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani said. "How lovely it is that people can put aside what divides them to celebrate their diversity and what brings them together." Following this, attendees were stunned by fireworks seen through the roof of Al Bayt stadium.

But this was not the highlight of the day. Instead, the 20-year-old Ghanim Al Muftah stole the show with his spectacular recitation of verses from the Holy Quran. Al Muftah is also a FIFA World Cup ambassador.

“Oh mankind, indeed we have created you from male and female and made you peoples and tribes that you may know one another,” Al Muftah said. Perhaps, in the history of FIFA, this is the first time the ceremony opened with Quranic verses.

Al Muftah, whose lower spine was impaired due to a rare condition, was not alone. Oscar-winner Morgan Freeman was also a part of the celebration, seated on the pitch beside the Qatari qari (a person who recited the Quran with the proper rules of recitation).

He then narrated the opening ceremony with a speech titled 'The Calling', where he told the spectators, "We all gather here in one big tribe. How can so many countries, languages, and cultures come together if only one way is accepted?"

Referencing 'bayt al sha'ar' (tents used by nomadic bedouins of the Arabian peninsula, Al Muftah said, "When you call here, we welcome you into our home." This shelter design also inspired the stadium's structure.

"I heard something beautiful. Not just music, but also this call to the celebration," Freeman began. Addressing the crowd, he said, "Football united nations and their love for the beautiful game. What brings together nations also brings together communities."

During his talk, what caught the audience's attention was a single beige glove on his right hand. The reason for this goes back to 2008 when Freeman's hand was paralyzed following a severe car crash in Mississippi.

Since then, the actor must regularly wear a compression glove, but due to promotional events, he prefers to remove it. This time, he decided to leave it on.

In 2010, during an interview with People, he said, “I suffered nerve damage, and it hasn’t gotten better. I can’t move it. If you don’t move your hand, it will swell up. Do you know you move your hand about a million times a day?”

After Freeman's speech, dancers, singers, and past World Cup mascots came on the field. Freeman and Al Muftah then gave the reign to BTS' Jungkook, who performed Dreamers during the ceremony. Even Qatari singer Dana was also a part of the show.
