# The history of World Cup in football

![Image 1: World Cup trophy](https://www.footballhistory.org/images/fifa_world_cup_trophy.jpg)T here is nothing in football that can compare with the World Cup. Even though the UEFA Champions League may produce games of the same quality, it can't overreach the status earned from the long tradition and the fact that one team represent a whole country. No other sport event can compete in significance: the latest FIFA World Cup reached over three billion television viewers worldwide and one billion watched the final.

Background
----------

Before the World Cup was inaugurated, [the football tournament arranged as part of the Summer Olympics](https://www.footballhistory.org/tournament/summer-olympics.html) was given the most prestige. But in the 1920s, the game was facing a transition to professionalism that wasn't consistent with the Olympic spirit. Therefore, the government body, FIFA, made plans to organize a World Cup. The decision of arranging the first edition was officially declared on May 26, 1928.

The first official World Cup was played in Uruguay 1930, and since when the tournament has been held every fourth year (with exceptions for interruption due to the Second World War). There were, however, unofficial pre-FIFA World Cups already in the late 1800s, in a time when only few national teams existed. Another unofficial "world cup" arranged before 1930 was [Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Thomas_Lipton_Trophy) held in 1909 and 1911. Besides that, the Summer Olympic football competitions would be a mark of which the best national teams were before 1930. The Olympic tournaments consisted, however, only of amateur teams – the World Cup became the "real deal".
