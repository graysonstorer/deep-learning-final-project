Valencia: We didn't live up to Ecuador's expectations
=====================================================

Published 29 Nov 2022

Share

It was a day to forget for La Tri, who were knocked out after losing to Senegal.

![Image 9: FIFA](https://digitalhub.fifa.com/transform/52347e69-8bd5-4c05-a737-6a9b7f57e1ae/Ecuador-v-Senegal-Group-A-FIFA-World-Cup-Qatar-2022?&io=transform:fill,width:768&quality=75)

*   **Ecuador's coach and players have been reacting to their Qatar 2022 exit**

*   **La Tri producest their weakest performance of the tournament to lose 2-1 to Senegal**

*   **Gustavo Alfaro: These boys will get their revenge one day**

Gonzalo Plata stretched his shirt over his face to hide his tears. Moises Caicedo, heartbroken and on the verge of fainting, was covered with a bib as a makeshift cloak to conceal his emotions. Piero Hincapie was crying too. Ecuador had just been eliminated from the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022™.

Players tried to console each other, although there was no consolation, their dreams now over. While Senegal celebrated on the pitch at the Khalifa International Stadium,_La Tri_ recoiled in pain. Gustavo Alfaro’s men chose the worst moment possible to produce their worst performance of the tournament. After two displays that bordered on relative perfection, here all their mistakes came out at once.

There were clear lapses in concentration, especially when the unmarked Kalidou Koulibaly was allowed to score the winning goal just three minutes after Caicedo’s equaliser. “It’s a big blow and extremely frustrating,” said the coach at the press conference after the game. “Details can make the difference and that’s exactly what happened.” Ecuador felt the absence the suspended Jhegson Mendez, who had collected two yellow cards. Having been called into the starting line-up as an emergency replacement for Carlos Gruezo, who was struggling with injury, he had been one of the team’s shining lights in Qatar.

As a result, Ecuador looked sluggish and missed his ability at opening up the game from deep as well as his presence going forward. Without that creativity, Ecuador succumbed to Senegal’s intensity and physicality – two attributes that had served them so well against Qatar and the Netherlands. _La Tri_ were second best in the tackles and 50-50 balls from the outset, overawed by their opponents and – for the first time – the occasion.

Aware that they only needed a draw to go through, Ecuador set out to defend their position in the Group A standings but were soon overwhelmed in a first half in which nothing seemed to click. Senegal were able to create more chances in those 45 minutes than the Netherlands and Qatar had mustered across two entire games, but some wasteful finishing from their forwards kept the score level.

That was until just before the half-time interval, which was fast approaching as an opportunity to reset and start afresh, when Hincapie committed a foul inside the area that allowed Ismaila Sarr to confidently score the opener from the penalty spot. “The team played with the right commitment in the second half,” said Alfaro, who switched formation and chose to replace the two players that had come into the side following the game against the Netherlands: Gruezo and Alan Franco were taken off for Jeremy Sarmiento and Jose Cifuentes as the side reverted to a 4-4-2.

The latter partnered Caicedo in midfield for the first time, with Sarmiento on the left and Plata wide on the right. Ecuador pulled level thanks to the kind of desire and fearlessness that Sarmiento has showed in his fledgling Premier League career so far.

Caicedo, _La Tri’s_ new hero and one of the few players capable of matching Senegal’s physical intensity, equalised after a cross into the box that the defence failed to deal with. The goal roused the fans of a nation dreaming of advancing beyond the group stage, but those hopes lasted just three minutes. Senegal hit back immediately through the tireless Koulibaly, who was first to a loose ball inside the box, smashing it past Hernan Galindez. “We lacked the experience to control the tempo after the goal,” said Alfaro. “It was little details. Senegal’s second goal hurt us because the team was doing well on the pitch.” The African side’s swift response crushed the spirit of a team that began to sense it was not their day. And so it proved: Senegal held on to book their ticket to the next round as group runners-up behind the Netherlands. It is still too soon to carry out an analysis, which will be done behind closed doors, but Alfaro, who cast doubt on whether he would continue in his role, believes more is to come: “This is a young crop of players, a team with more of a future than a present. Hopefully these battles will serve them well in the future. I have no doubt that these boys will get their revenge one day.”

For the Ecuadorian squad, the fourth youngest at these finals, Qatar 2022 is only the start of their journey. The strength of emotion felt by Plata, Caicedo and Hincapie is understandable but in 2026 they will be able to look back and realise that, despite the unhappy outcome here, their first World Cup adventure was a significant one. It was the introduction of a crop of players that, with those three youngsters at the forefront, showed they can compete with the best in the world.

Enner Valencia, who scored three of his side’s four goals in Qatar, is unsure if he will get another chance. “I’m sorry. Unfortunately we didn’t live up to Ecuador’s expectations,” he said in the mixed zone as tears rolled down his cheeks. “It’s a very difficult moment, we weren’t expecting this. We were very happy and enthusiastic about what we’d been doing. We apologise to all of Ecuador.” Other players also offered apologies and, after passing through the mixed zone, went out to the side of the pitch at the Khalifa Stadium where their families, relatives and some fans were waiting for them. Even long after the final whistle Ecuador still felt the sting of their exit, the pain of which they will only be able to make amends for in four years’ time.
