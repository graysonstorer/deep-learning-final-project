# Croatia vs. Morocco final score, result: Orsic wonderstrike gives Modric World Cup farewell bronze

Mislav Orsic's sublime goal towards the end of the first half gave Croatia a 2-1 win over Morocco in the third-place playoff at the [2022 FIFA World Cup](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/soccer/news/world-cup-third-place-match-debate-fifa/he6kwgoc4yxbj3rqek9wprwj).

Morocco were without key defenders Romain Saiss,Nayef Aguerd and Noussair Mazraoui and they began uncertainly before Josko Gvardiol converted a smartly worked set piece in the seventh minute. But Morocco centre-back Achraf Dari was left unmarked to hit back immediately.

Would Lionel Messi struggle in MLS?

Both sides continued to attack with the pressure off, making for an attractive spectacle. The most sumptuous moment of the first half came when Orsic lofted a beautiful finish over Bono and in off the far post after the Morocco goalkeeper saw his team give possession away on the edge of his area.

The second period became more attritional as both sides suffered injuries and put everything on the line one last time after their superb campaigns in Qatar.

Morocco got themselves in a mess early on, repeatedly trying and failing to play through Croatia’s astute press. In the end, a clever set play undid them, with Ivan Perisic flicking back across goal for Gvardiol to score and banish the memory of his semifinal torment at the hands of Lionel Messi.

Croatia left the door open almost immediately when Luka Modric half-blocked a wide free-kick and Dari was allowed to head the looping ball past Dominik Livakovic.

Modric, almost certainly playing for the last time on this stage despite his apparent immunity to fatigue at 37, conducted proceedings in a typically masterful fashion, but Achraf Hakimi, Hakim Ziyech and Sofiane Boufal ensured Morocco’s threat on the counter remained.

It made for an intriguing game of cat and mouse before Orsic produced the cream. The Atlas Lions again coughed up possession on the edge of their own box but the Dinamo Zagreb winger had so much to do when Marko Livaja picked him out.

He did his job with utter aplomb, which was more than could be said for referee Abdulrahman Al-Jassim, when he fairly inexplicably failed to punish Sofyan Amrabat for what looked like a clear 73rd-minute foul on Gvardiol in the box.

Amrabat was operating as an emergency centre-back by that stage, with injuries having accounted for Dari and Jawad El-Jamiq, but Morocco continued battling to the last and a leaping Youssef En-Nesyri almost forced an additional half-hour when he headed onto the roof of the net in the sixth minute of stoppage time.

Croatia vs Morocco as it happened, highlights from 2022 World Cup
-----------------------------------------------------------------

**Fulltime**: Croatia's players stream off the bench as Morocco's surround and lambast the referee. Try telling them this game doesn't matter. Runners up last time around, Croatia - this remarkably European nation of just four million people - are on the World Cup podium again.

**90th minute+6**:Ohhhhhh, so close. Youssef En-Nesyri gets up brilliantly above Ivan Perisic at the far post but he can't quite steer his header down and it ripples the top of the netting.

**90th minute+4**: Croatia are two minutes away from claiming a place on the podium on Luka Modric's farewell. Morocco's attacks are getting a little more desperate. Defensive midfielder Kristijan Jakic is coming on for probable matchwinner Mislav Orsic.

**90th minute**: There will be six added minutes, prompting another roar from Morocco's fans urging their team on.

**85th minute**: A foul on Bruno Petkovic by Selim Amallah leads to a bit of a scrum, with tempers fraying as fulltime approaches. Amallah is booked.

**82nd minute**: The changes and injuries appear to have taken more of a toll on Morocco and Croatia are on top. Bruno Petkovic has won their latest corner.

**74th minute**: Mayhem here**.**Amrabat looks for all the world to have brought down Gvardiol in the box. The referee waves play on, Morocco break and twice go close themselves. Finally we get a break in play and the VAR saw nothing wrong with that!

**71st minute**: Sofyan Amrabat, in that new and unfamiliar role, gives the ball away and substitute Nikola Vlasic fires over from outside the area,

**68th minute**: It's easy to start questioning the wisdom of this extra game within the packed tournament schedule, because they're dropping like flies now. Jawad El-Yamiq is limping off, which means it's now a case of any warm body at centre-back for Morocco. Midfielder Selim Amallah is on, with Sofyan Amrabat dropping back into defence.

**66th minute**: Croatia's turn for a double change as Mario Pasilic and Bruno Petkovic come on for Lovro Majer and Marko Livaja.

**64th minute**: Achraf Dari also can't manage any more. He makes way, along with Sofiane Boufal, with Badr Benoun and Burnley's Anass Zaroury coming on.

**60th minute**: Andrej Kramaric's race is run. He pulled something delivering a cross a few moments ago and Nikola Vlasic is coming on. A sad end to another fine tournament for the Hoffenheim forward.

**55th minute**:Good opportunity to get in down the right for Andrej Kramaric but Yahya Attiat-Allah makes an important challenge. Azzedine Ounahi, one of Morocco's starts of the tournament is going to come on for the 18-year-old Bilal El-Khannouss, who has been very easy on the eye.

**51st minute**: Beautifully worked attack down the left from Croatia, with Ivan Perisic involved and Lovro Majer whipping in a dangerous ball that Marko Livaja is just unable to convert under pressure. Replays show Croatia should have had a corner.

**47th minute**: Mislav Orsic goes looking for his second and it's deflected into the side netting.

**46th minute**: We're back underway and there's a halftime change for Morocco. Not Achraf Dari, who is fit to continue, but Abdelhamid Sabiri is replaced by Ilias Chair. It looks like Chair will be stationed out on the right, with Hakim Ziyech tucking into a central role.

**Halftime:**The teams head for the tunnel, with the exception of Morocco goalscorer Achraf Dari, who is down and needing treatment. Walid Regragui can scarcely afford another centre-back injury.

**45th minute+2**: That looked a nasty deflection from Marko Livaja's shot but Bono gets back to pouch the ball.

**45th minute**: There will be two minutes of stoppage time at the end of this thoroughly enjoyable half.

**42nd minute**:**GOOOOAAAALLLL!!!! Mislav Orsic!!!!**

What a wonderful finish from Orsic! Again, Morocco give away possession on the edge of their box but the Dinamo Zagreb winger still had so much to do as he lofted a right-footed finish from the left-hand side of the area over Bono and in off the far post. Absolutely sublime.

**40th minute**: Hakim Ziyech chops inside and lines up a long-range shot. It's off target but shows the extent to which he is oozing with confidence. Chelsea fans will be wanting him to bottle some of this and bring it back from Qatar.

**37th minute**: In-swinging corner from Hakim Ziyech and Youssef En-Nesyri get to the near-post header. It flashes wide of the far stick, with no one available to apply the finish.

**33rd minute**: Another wonderfully worked Morocco attack, with Sofiane Boufal coming off the wing and interacting sublimely with Bilal Khannouss. Josip Sutalo gets back to make a vital tackle.

**29th minute**: Morocco are now being limited to largely operating on the break, but boy they're good at that. Achraf Hakim and Hakim Ziyech exchange passes and the Paris Saint-Germain full-back is away down the right. His cross is a bit on the wild side though and flies behind Youssef En-Nesyri, who might reasonably have expected a simple finish.

**23rd minute**: It's comedy hour in that Morocco defence, with two botched clearances leaving Modric to claim possession on the edge of the box. The master playmaker shuffles into space and lets fly with a deflected shot that Bono parries and then just manages to scramble away the rebound from Marko Livaja.

**18th minute**: Sofiane Boufal is dispossessed and here come Croatia again. They are crowded out by a scampering Morocco defence before Andrej Kramaric gives Bono a routine save.

**14th minute**: Morocco are not covering themselves in glory trying to play through the Croatia press. Again they cough up possession and Josip Stanisic, up from right-back, clatters over.

**10th minute**: Back come Croatia as Mislav Orsic clatters wide from 25 yards. If you were wondering how these two defensively cautious teams might approach this ceremonial game, you have your answer!

**9th minute**:**GOOOOAAAALLLL!!!! Achraf Dari!!!!!**

Well, Croatia's lead didn't last long. A set-piece is taken short and the delivery balloons up off Modric's attempted block and into the box. Somewhat foolishly, no one decided to mark Dari and the big centre-back gleefully headed home from close range. Handbreaks off all over the place.

**7th minute**:**GOOOOAAAALLLL!!!! Josko Gvardiol!!!**

It's been on the cards and the opening goal is wonderfully worked by Croatia, with Ivan Perisic glancing a free-kick back towards the centre of goal and Gvardiol dispatches a fine diving header.

**3rd minute**: Morocco clear their lines, more by accident than design. This is a backline thrown together due to injuries, remember, but Walid Regragui is not a happy man with this start.

**2nd minute**: Ivan Perisic gets down the left flank and delivers a dangerous cross that Achraf Dari heads clear. Bono then gives away a corner - something of a relief given he almost booted the ball into his own net.

**1st minute**: And we're off. Croatia won their previous third-place match in their first ever World Cup, beating the Netherlands after a semifinal loss to eventual winners France.

**50 mins from kickoff**: There's a growing consensus from chatter around the game that Ivan Perisic will line up at left-back for Croatia in a 4-2-3-1. That probably makes more sense than the 3-5-2 I threw together, so let's go with that. If Dalic does set up in that way, those are two attack-minded lineups.

**1hr from kickoff**: Morocco have given me a more straightforward puzzle to crack. They're in their usual 4-3-3 and there's a start for 18-year-old midfielder Bilal El-Khannouss.

**1hr 10 mins from kickoff**: Bit of a head-scratcher how that Croatia lineup might shake out. Stanisic, Sutalo and Gvardiola are the only orthodox defenders in the side. I'm going to tentatively suggest a 3-5-2 with Perisic and Orsic as the wingbacks and Livaja joining Kramaric up front.

**1hr 24 mins from kickoff**: Here's how Croatia line up:

**2 hrs 40 mins from kickoff**: Argentina goalkeeper Emi Martinez is on press conference duty ahead of the big one tomorrow."It's crazy to be in the world final," he said. "We started losing to Saudi Arabia, but we improved game by game." Crazy is the word. World Cups can bend your perception of space and time in most circumstances, but it feels like an incredible amount of time has passed since that shock opener for Lionel Messi and his teammates. The date stamp on the tweet below suggests just 25 days. I'll never believe it!

**3 hrs from kickoff**: As this World Cup takes place amid the holiday season, it occurs that the third-place playoff can feel like the football equivalent of a cold turkey sandwich when you're already more than full. However, it doesn't have to be like that. With the shackles off, the players on display can produce some special moments. Take this obscene goal from Nelinho for Brazil against Italy in the 1978 bronze medal game as the most emphatic example.

**3 hrs 45 from kickoff:**We only have to rewind to day four in Qatar for an indication of how today's match could play-out. Morocco versus Croatia is the only fixture to be played twice at this World Cup. They kicked off Group F with a 0-0 draw that saw Croatia control possession but struggle in the final third against the well-organised Moroccans.

**4 hrs from kickoff:**Although no longer fighting for the World Cup, Moroccan motivation will remain. This afternoon, a new benchmark will be set for African nations on football's biggest stage.
