 Organization: [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/NO404)

 These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to. That way, as the pages that are referenced are changed or taken from the web, a link to the version that was live when the page was written will be preserved. 

 Then the Internet Archive hopes that references to these archived pages will be put in place of a link that would be otherwise be broken, or a companion link to allow people to see what was originally intended by a page's authors. 

 The goal is to [fix all broken links on the web](https://blog.archive.org/2013/10/25/fixing-broken-links/). Crawls of supported "No More 404" sites. 

Collection: [Wikipedia Near Real Time (from IRC)](https://archive.org/details/NO404-WKP)

 This is a collection of web page captures from links added to, or changed on, Wikipedia pages. The idea is to bring a reliability to Wikipedia outlinks so that if the pages referenced by Wikipedia articles are changed, or go away, a reader can permanently find what was originally referred to. 

 This is part of the Internet Archive's attempt to [rid the web of broken links](https://blog.archive.org/2013/10/25/fixing-broken-links/).

Football Federation Australia is set to ask for compensation should [Fifa](https://web.archive.org/web/20161226060927/https://www.theguardian.com/football/fifa) move the 2022 Qatar World Cup to the northern hemisphere winter.

The FFA is believed to want $43m – the amount it spent on its pitch for the World Cup – in compensation. The FFA's bid for the tournament was based on the World Cup taking place in June and July.

In a [statement on the FFA's website](https://web.archive.org/web/20161226060927/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/news-display/lowy-|--fifa-should-not-rush-decision-on-qatar-2022-/75086), it said Fifa should consider "an in-principle decision that just and fair compensation should be paid to those nations that invested many millions, and national prestige, in bidding for a summer event".

Fifa's executive committee meets on 3 October and the FFA is conscious that a switch would affect leagues around the world, including the A-League, which currently runs from October to May.

"Our season takes place during the Australian summer to avoid a clash with other local football codes, a move that was necessary because the A-League simply could not get access to the high standard stadiums required, as they were being used by other codes during the Australian winter," said the FFA chairman, Frank Lowy.

"If the World Cup were to be staged in the middle of our A-League season it would impact on our competition, not just for 2022, but for the seasons leading up to and beyond that date. Clubs, investors, broadcasters, players and fans would all be affected."
