# Uruguay vs. South Korea final score, result: La Celeste hit post twice in 2022 World Cup Group H opener

Uruguay hit the post twice as they failed to register a third World Cup win in three matches against South Korea in their Group H opener.

Veteran defender Diego Godin, in his fourth World Cup, thumped a header against the base of a post from a corner before half-time, while a thunderous late strike from Federico Valverde also found the woodwork.

Hwang Ui-jo also spurned a glorious opportunity for South Korea, in their 10th consecutive finals appearance, when he fired over the bar from close range in the 34th minute.

Tottenham's Son Heung-min, sporting a protective mask after facial surgery, and Liverpool's Darwin Nunez also curled efforts wide as neither side could muster a single official shot on target - a World Cup record.

It all added up to a fourth goalless draw in 14 matches at this World Cup, after only one in 64 in 2018.

Uruguay’s next match is against Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal on Monday, November 28, while South Korea face Ghana on the same day.

**FULL-TIME: Uruguay 0-0 South Korea**

And that's it. A point on the board for both sides. Not the worst result in the world, with Portugal and Ghana the other sides in Group H.

That's the fourth goalless draw at this World Cup, after only one in 64 matches at the last tournament. And I've covered all of them. Hmm...

**90th +4 min:**Both sides still going for it as we enter the last knockings, but it's all a bit desperate and lacking in quality.

**90th+1 min:**And we'll have SEVEN minutes of added time. That's more like it. Was worried the officials had lost their watches in the first half.

**90th min:**And Son goes close at the other end! A poor clearance from Sergio Rochet is pounced on by the Spurs star, but he cracks his left-footed effort wide of the post.

**89th min:** Uruguay hit the post again! Federico Valverde launches a thunderous effort from distance that thumps off Kim Seung-gyu's right post. Unlucky from the Real Madrid man.

**88th min:**Last throw of the dice from Uruguay, who send on Guillermo Varela for Facundo Pellistri.

**83rd min:** The South Korean drummers in the crowd are banging out some rhythms to encourage their side. But do either side have the will or creativity to find a late winner?

**81st min:**First sign of Edinson Cavani's physicality as he bustles his way past a couple of defenders before finding Darwin Nunez, whose curling effort is just wide of the far post.

**78th min:** Uruguay also bring on reinforcements,Nicolas De La Cruz and Matias Vina replacing Matias Vecino and Mathias Olivera.

**77th min:**Cho Gue-sung, just on as a sub, brings down a high ball just outside the area and hits an instinctive left-foot shot that drifts just wide of the right post. Good attempt.

**74th min:** Triple change for South Korea, with Cho Gue-sung,Son Jun-ho and Lee Kang-in on for Hwang Ui-jo,Na Sang-ho and Yoon Jong-gyu.

**71st min:**Son sets off in pursuit of a long ball forward, but Uruguay keeper Sergio Rochet is out quickly to head it away just outside his area.

**69th min:**Uruguay hogging possession now. South Korea penned inside their own half, but staying disciplined.

**65th min:**That's Edinson Cavani on, and Suarez off. Little impact from the starting veteran. Can Cavani do any better?

**63rd min:**Sensational long pass from Diego Godin finds Darwin Nunez out on the left. He skins Kim Min-jae but after getting to the byline, takes a touch too many and Kim Young-gwon gets back to take the sting out of his final ball.

**60th min:**Uruguay are readying Edinson Cavani for action. You'd imagine it will be his fellow 35-year-old Luis Suarez making way.

**56th min:** While we wait for play to resume, check out this sublime bit of skill from Rodrigo Bentancur - _if you're in the UK:_

**55th min:**Son is down getting treatment after taking a sore one on his heel in a challenge from Martin Caceres. The Uruguayan defender gets a yellow card for his trouble.

**51st min:**Son Heung-min creates space for himself in the Uruguay penalty area, but a brilliant block from Jose Maria Gimenez prevents the South Korean star from getting a shot away. Son's corner is flicked on but Sergio Rochet punches it clear.

**48th min:**Luis Suarez chases a long ball over the top for Uruguay but the veteran striker is flagged offside. At 35 now, the wily forward probably needs that extra half a second to get ahead of the opposition defenders.

**46th min:**No changes for either side as the second half gets underway.

**HALF-TIME: Uruguay 0-0 South Korea.**

**45th min:** BREAKING NEWS: Only one minute of added time! That's a record for this World Cup.

**43rd min:**Uruguay hit the post!Jung Woo-young does well to get to a dangerous cross from Facundo Pellistri just ahead of Luis Suarez and from the corner, veteran defender Diego Godin thumps a header onto the bottom of the left post. Closest Uruguay have come to a goal.

**39th min:**In-Beom Hwang tries his luck from distance for South Korea, but he can't keep it down. Optimistic from there.

**34th min:** Massive chance for South Korea! Great play from Kim Moon-hwan but when the cross comes in from the right, Hwang Ui-jo scythes it over the bar. Should have scored!

**27th min:**Chance for Uruguay as Mathias Olivera strides deep into South Korea territory but with Darwin Nunez outside him, he completely overhits the pass with the outside of his left foot. Poor.

**25th min:**Lovely bit of footwork from Son, who cuts inside Martin Caceres but his curling effort is headed away by Mathias Olivera.

**21st min:**Another superb ball from Gimenez out to Facundo Pellistri on the right wing and a first-time cross almost reaches Darwin Nunez, but the Liverpool striker can't get a foot on it. Uruguay threatening though.

**19th min:** Federico Valverde creates half a chance for himself by brilliantly controlling a long pass from Jose Maria Gimenez, but hooks his left-foot half-volley just wide of the right post from the edge of the area.

**16th min:**A good long ball sets Kim Jin-su away down the left flank for South Korea, but the ball had just gone over the byline before his hanging cross is dealt with by Uruguay keeper Sergio Rochet.

**13th min:**The pace has slowed after a fairly frenetic opening, both sides trying to play out patiently from the back.

**8th min:** Na Sang-ho gets to the byline to win a corner for South Korea, but Son, wearing a protective mask after recent facial surgery, doesn't quite connect properly with it and it curls away from everyone.

**5th min:** Liverpool's Darwin Nunez already looking a threat for Uruguay, and Na Sang-ho pulls him back with a tug of the shirt to prevent the 23-year-old forward escaping.

**3rd min:**Screams and cheers from the South Korea fans every time the ball finds its way to Son Heung-min. Fair to say they're very happy the Tottenham star has been passed fit to play.

**1st min:** The formalities are over, and we're underway at Education City Stadium.

**5 mins from kickoff:**Time for the anthems. Uruguay first, and now South Korea.

**50 mins from kickoff:**Diego Forlan is in attendance at the Education City stadium and he's bumped into a fellow Manchester United cult hero in the stands. The iconic Uruguayan striker shared a photo on Instagram featuring Ji-Sung Park: the South Korean midfielder, Champions League winner and one of Sir Alex Ferguson's favourite sons. Just 212 international caps in this picture!

**1 hrs 10 from kickoff:**South Korea have released their lineup, lead by Tottenham's Heung-min Son. The prolific captain will be donning a face mask, as he is still recovering from fracturing a bone around his eye.

**1 hrs 45 from kickoff:**South Korea have been drawn in a tough group but fans will still be dreaming of an appearance in the knockout rounds in Qatar. Their greatest World Cup performance took place on home soil, when South Korea and Japan shared a controversial 2002 tournament.

**2 hrs 15 from kickoff:**As Uruguay kickoff their Qatar adventure, they also begin the final World Cup for two all-time greats. Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani have scored a combined 126 goals for their nation and in the twilight of their dazzling careers they'll hope to add to that total.

**2 hrs 50 from kickoff:**It's Luis Suarez back in World Cup action today which gives us the perfect opportunity to share this clip once again. There was simply no questioning the lengths the former Liverpool forward's was prepared to go to to ensure his team progressed. Here's his infamous handball against Ghana in the 2010 quarterfinals.

**3 hrs 30 from kickoff:** Hello, and welcome to The Sporting News' live coverage of this Group H opener between Uruguay and South Korea. There will be a lot of focus, as there always is, on one particular man in this group— with Portugal and Cristiano Ronaldo to come for both these sides, along with African powerhouses Ghana. But don't be surprised if there are other headline-makers, and a few twists and turns along the way. Both these teams have plentiful talent of their own, who could grab the spotlight today in this opener. Let's get going!
