"The government said their main concern was the people of the country and they would not support the bid," said Fifa secretary general Jerome Valcke. Meanwhile, a move to impose an eight-year limit on the office of Fifa president has been heavily defeated. Asian federation chief Mohamed Bin Hammam had proposed the limit from 2011 onwards at the Fifa executive committee meeting in Zurich, but the motion was rejected by 15 votes to five with one abstention. ![Image 14: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013im_/http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/shared/img/o.gif)606: DEBATE [Who do you think should host the tournament?](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/606/ArticleSearch?phrase=Football&contenttype=-1&show=20) Fifa president Sepp Blatter is currently in his third term in office. Indonesia was considered to be an outsider of the 11 original candidates which applied to host the tournament in 2018 or 2022. Organisers of the bid had pledged to build seven new stadiums with matches to be played in 11 cities. "[The government's] main concern is to develop the country and they will not support the bid committee as much as Fifa requested," added Valcke. "We have informed Indonesia that because they have failed to provide a number of documents and guarantees, Indonesia is not any more a candidate for 2022." England now faces competition from Australia, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands/Belgium, Russia, Spain/Portugal and the United States in its bid to host the prestigious World Cup in 2018 or 2022. Qatar and South Korea are bidding to host the 2022 competition only. ### Bookmark with: * [Delicious](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://del.icio.us/post?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8577452.stm&title=Indonesia%202022%20World%20Cup%20bid%20over "Post this story to Delicious") * [Digg](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://digg.com/submit?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8577452.stm&title=Indonesia%202022%20World%20Cup%20bid%20over "Post this story to Digg") * [reddit](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://reddit.com/submit?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8577452.stm&title=Indonesia%202022%20World%20Cup%20bid%20over "Post this story to reddit") * [Facebook](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8577452.stm "Post this story to Facebook") * [StumbleUpon](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8577452.stm&title=Indonesia%202022%20World%20Cup%20bid%20over "Post this story to StumbleUpon") [What are these?](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/help/6915817.stm) [![Image 15: A 17x11 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013im_/http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/sol/shared/img/v3/email.gif) E-mail this to a friend](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/email/news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8577452.stm)[![Image 16: A 17x11 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013im_/http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/sol/shared/img/v3/print.gif) Printable version](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8577452.stm?ad=1) Print Sponsor![Image 17: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013im_/http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/shared/img/o.gif) see also [2018 World Cup bidders make cases](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8394320.stm) 04 Dec 09| Internationals [England 'must improve 2018 bid'](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8293866.stm) 07 Oct 09| Football [Triesman calls for World Cup bid support](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8055841.stm) 18 May 09| Internationals [The race to host World Cup 2018 and 2022](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7856716.stm) 17 Mar 09| Internationals * * * ![Image 18: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013im_/http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/shared/img/o.gif) FROM OTHER SPORT SITES [The Scotsman](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://c.moreover.com/click/here.pl?z2637364751&z=950245038)Blatter survives Fifa vote to limit leader's term-3 hrs ago [Times Live South Africa](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://c.moreover.com/click/here.pl?z2636634330&z=950245038)Indonesia out of 2022 World Cup race-10 hrs ago [San Francisco Chronicle](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://c.moreover.com/click/here.pl?z2636341826&z=950244128)FIFA says Indonesia out of 2022 World Cup race-12 hrs ago [Guardian.co.uk](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://c.moreover.com/click/here.pl?z2636277834&z=950244128)Sepp Blatter cements position at top of Fifa as revenue tops $1bn-12 hrs ago [Monsters and Critics](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://c.moreover.com/click/here.pl?z2636275838&z=950245038)FIFA takes Indonesia off World Cup bid list, lifts Iraq suspension-12 hrs ago [About these results](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/3679584.stm) ![Image 19: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](https://web.archive.org/web/20100320054013im_/http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/shared/img/o.gif)
