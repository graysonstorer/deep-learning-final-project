Fifa World Cup: Results and reaction from day fou

An apologetic Breel Embolo scored the winner against the country of his birth to hand [Switzerland](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/switzerland-football)a 1-0 victory over [Cameroon](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/cameroon-football)in their [World Cup](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/world-cup-2022)Group G clash at the Al Janoub Stadium on Thursday.

Embolo swept home a low [Xherdan Shaqiri](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/xherdan-shaqiri) cross after 48 minutes and then stood still with a rueful frown on his face as his team mates celebrated around him. The 25-year-old was born in Yaounde but raised in Basel.

Cameroon were the better side in the opening half and might have had the lead as Karl Toko Ekambi, Eric-Maxim Choupo-Moting and Martin Hongla all missed good chances against a lacklustre Switzerland side that battled to get out of first gear.

But the Swiss were much improved in the second period and took the lead through Embolo’s well-worked goal. Ruben Vargas missed an excellent chance to score a second but was thwarted by goalkeeper Andre Onana as Cameroon ran out of steam.

**_Follow all the reaction with our live blog below, before attention turns to Uruguay vs South Korea in Group H_**

### Uruguay flatter to deceive in World Cup stalemate with South Korea

If this Uruguay 2.0 are to scale the heights of the heroes of old then they will have to find a performance far more worthy of them after opening their World Cup with a hugely disappointing goalless stalemate with South Korea.

Diego Alonso’s new La Celeste have tantalised many in the build-up to this tournament with their blend of wise old heads and virulent new blood combining to great effect over the last 12 months, but neither element could make the key contribution here as a resolute Korea more than earned a point to start their own journey in Qatar on a positive note.

**Report by Ben ‘0-0 magnet’ Burrows at the Education City Stadium**

Uruguay 0-0 South Korea: Diego Alonso’s blend of experience and young talent has made La Celeste a popular outside pick for glory in Qatar but this was a disjointed showing and Korea deserved their draw

### Uruguay vs South Korea player ratings as Valverde impresses

Uruguay vs South Korea player ratings

**Valverde - 8**: Great run deep, touch and strike at goal. A rocket in the 90th minute that rattled the woodwork and a warrior out of possession, putting his body on the line.

**Nunez - 6**: Missed a chance lunging as ball came across goal. Brilliant industry to work back and counter and then surged clear in second half to set up a big chance.

**Son - 7**: Brilliant feet to sit Caceres down, was on the periphery of the game for long spells, but made a stunning long ball in behind to try catch Uruguay out after sitting in a low block. Almost found the bottom corner with a crisp strike that curled wide.

See the rest, here:

Uruguay 0-0 South Korea: The Real Madrid midfielder rattled the woodwork late on as both sides cancelled each other out

### FULL TIME: Uruguay 0-0 South Korea

That will be the story of the game, Uruguay going close but just not doing enough to earn the win. Both Godin and Valverde struck the woodwork but Uruguay were disappointing overall and did not create enough chances against a stubborn and organised South Korean team.

South Korea were probably the better team in the first half but could not take their chances. Son Heung-min was quiet, though, and they were very passive in the second half.

### FULL TIME: Uruguay 0-0 South Korea

And that is that.

We have our fourth 0-0 of the World Cup - and for a match where we had so much hope!

But Valverde came**_this close_** to snatching the win at the end.
