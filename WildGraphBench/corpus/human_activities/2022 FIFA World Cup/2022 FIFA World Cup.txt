 We owe you an explanation. 

December 5: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Friday, December 5, and this moment matters for Wikipedia because we haven't hit our goal yet. If you're like us, you've used Wikipedia countless times. To settle an argument with a friend. To satisfy a curiosity. Whether it's 3 in the morning or afternoon, Wikipedia is useful in your life. Please give $2.75.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a nonprofit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Just 2% of our readers donate, so if you have given in the past and Wikipedia still provides you with $2.75 worth of knowledge, donate today. If you are undecided, remember any contribution helps.

25 years of the internet at its **best**

 Accountability and transparency are core values at the Wikimedia Foundation. We manage funds and resources to ensure that every contribution supports our mission. We have earned the Platinum Seal of Transparency from Candid (formerly GuideStar), and Charity Navigator awarded us its highest rating. You can [read our most recent annual report](https://annual.wikimedia.org/) for more information about our financial health. 

 Investment in Technology 45%
Nearly half of our budget goes toward supporting the technology that powers Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects. We are constantly working to enhance the user experience for both contributors and readers, improve site security, and ensure reliable access to our websites globally. This infrastructure and product support sustain one of the top ten most visited websites in the world, all at a fraction of the cost of popular for-profit websites.

 Support for Volunteers 34%
The global reach of Wikimedia projects is made possible by the hard work of volunteers from across the globe. We provide grants, legal support, and other resources to help build vibrant volunteer communities. Additionally, we promote community engagement through outreach initiatives and advocate for the growth and protection of free knowledge.

 General and Administrative Expenses 12%
Operational costs are essential for the smooth management and governance of the Wikimedia Foundation. These expenses help us recruit top talent and support staff around the world, empowering them to carry out the mission of the Wikimedia Foundation.

 Allocation to Fundraising Efforts 11%
Donor support is crucial to sustaining Wikipedia and our other free knowledge endeavors. Our team is committed to efficient and effective fundraising throughout the year, ensuring that every contribution helps advance our mission.

The **2022 FIFA World Cup** was the 22nd [FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup "FIFA World Cup"), the quadrennial world championship for national [football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football "Football") teams organised by [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA "FIFA"). It took place in [Qatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar "Qatar") from 20 November to 18 December 2022, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the first World Cup to be held in the [Middle East](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East "Middle East") and the [Arabian Peninsula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabian_Peninsula "Arabian Peninsula"), and the second in an Asian country after the [2002 tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup "2002 FIFA World Cup") in [South Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea "South Korea") and [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan "Japan").[[A]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-2)

This tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the [2026 World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_FIFA_World_Cup "2026 FIFA World Cup"). To avoid the extremes of [Qatar's hot and humid climate in summers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Qatar#Climate "Geography of Qatar"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-auto5-3) the event was held in November and December, becoming the first one to take place outside the traditional months of May, June, and July.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-auto5-3)[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-4) It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in [eight venues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#Stadiums) across [five cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#Cities). [Qatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_national_football_team "Qatar national football team") entered the event—their first World Cup—automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the [qualification process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification "2022 FIFA World Cup qualification").

[Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco_national_football_team "Morocco national football team") made history by becoming the first African nation to reach the semi-final of a World Cup, falling short 0–2 against [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team "France national football team").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-5)[Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina_national_football_team "Argentina national football team") were crowned the champions after winning [the final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_final "2022 FIFA World Cup final") against the [title holder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_final "2018 FIFA World Cup final")[France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team "France national football team") 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since [1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_FIFA_World_Cup "1986 FIFA World Cup"). Argentina were the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since [2002](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup "2002 FIFA World Cup"). French player [Kylian Mbappé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp%C3%A9 "Kylian Mbappé") became the first player to score a [hat-trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick "Hat-trick") in a World Cup final since [Geoff Hurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Hurst "Geoff Hurst") in the [1966 final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_FIFA_World_Cup "1966 FIFA World Cup") and won the [Golden Boot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_Golden_Boot "FIFA World Cup Golden Boot") as he scored the most goals (eight) during the tournament. Mbappé also became the first player to score in two consecutive finals since [Vavá](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vav%C3%A1 "Vavá") of Brazil did the same in 1958 and 1962.

Argentine captain [Lionel Messi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Messi "Lionel Messi") was voted the tournament's best player, winning his second [Golden Ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_Golden_Ball "FIFA World Cup Golden Ball"). The tournament has been considered exceptionally poetic as the capstone of his career, with the win fulfilling for some commentators a previously unmet criterion to be regarded as the greatest player of all time.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-NYT2022-6) Teammates [Emiliano Martínez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emiliano_Mart%C3%ADnez "Emiliano Martínez") and [Enzo Fernández](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzo_Fern%C3%A1ndez "Enzo Fernández") won the [Golden Glove](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_Golden_Glove "FIFA World Cup Golden Glove"), awarded to the tournament's best [goalkeeper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goalkeeper_(association_football) "Goalkeeper (association football)"), and the [Young Player Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_Young_Player_Award "FIFA World Cup Young Player Award"), awarded to the tournament's best young player, respectively. With 172 goals, the tournament set a record for the highest number of goals scored in the 32-team format, with every participating team scoring at least one goal.

The choice to host the World Cup in Qatar [attracted significant criticism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies "2022 FIFA World Cup controversies"), with concerns raised over the country's [treatment of migrant workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies#Human_rights_concern "2022 FIFA World Cup controversies"), [women](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#LGBT_and_women's_rights), and [members of the LGBTQ+ community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Qatar "LGBT rights in Qatar"), as well as Qatar's climate, [lack of a strong football culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies#Qatari_football_record "2022 FIFA World Cup controversies"), scheduling changes, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and [wider FIFA corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_FIFA_corruption_case "2015 FIFA corruption case").[[B]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-15)

Format
------

The [FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup "FIFA World Cup") is a professional football tournament held between national football teams, organised by [FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA "FIFA").[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-16)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-17) The tournament, held every four years, was [first played in 1930](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1930_FIFA_World_Cup "1930 FIFA World Cup") in Uruguay,[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-foxsports.com-18) and has been contested by 32 teams since the [1998 event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_FIFA_World_Cup "1998 FIFA World Cup").[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-foxsports.com-18) The tournament was contested with eight [round-robin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament "Round-robin tournament") groups followed by a [knockout round](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-elimination_tournament "Single-elimination tournament") for 16 teams.[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-19) The defending champions were [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team "France national football team"), who defeated [Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Croatia_national_football_team "Croatia national football team") 4–2 in the [2018 FIFA World Cup Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_Final "2018 FIFA World Cup Final").[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-20)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-21) The event was scheduled to take place under a reduced length,[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-22) from 20 November to 18 December in Qatar.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-23)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-auto6-24)[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-25) Being held in Qatar, it was the first World Cup tournament to be held in the [Arab world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world "Arab world").[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-26) Spectators were not required to follow most [COVID-19 restrictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_restrictions "COVID-19 restrictions") such as social distancing, wearing masks, and negative tests.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-27)

### Schedule

Unlike previous FIFA World Cups, which are typically played in June and July, because of [Qatar's intense summer heat and often fairly high humidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geography_of_Qatar#Climate "Geography of Qatar"),[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-auto5-3)[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-auto6-24)[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-28) the 2022 World Cup was played in November and December.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-Atlantic_2022-7)[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-29) As a result, the World Cup was unusually staged in the middle of the seasons of many domestic association football leagues, which started in late July or August, including all of the major European leagues, which had been obliged to incorporate extended breaks into their domestic schedules to accommodate the World Cup. Major European competitions had scheduled their respective competitions group matches to be played before the World Cup, to avoid playing group matches the following year.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-30)

The match schedule was confirmed by FIFA on 15 July 2020.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-schedule_confirmed-31) The group stage was set to begin on 21 November, with four matches every day. Later, the schedule was tweaked by moving the Qatar vs Ecuador game to 20 November, after Qatar lobbied FIFA to allow their team to open the tournament.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-32)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-33)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-34) The final was played on 18 December 2022, [National Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Day_(Qatar) "National Day (Qatar)"), at [Lusail Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusail_Stadium "Lusail Stadium").[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-schedule_confirmed-31)[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-schedule-35) Unlike previous tournaments where the match venues and kick-off times for each fixture were set prior to the draw, the assignment of group fixtures for each matchday to a specific venue and kick-off time was only made after the final draw, with the teams of each specific fixture known. This was due to the close proximity of the venues, which allowed the organisers to optimise stadium allocation for spectators and kick-off times for television audiences.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-schedule_confirmed-31)

The matches for each group were allocated to the following stadiums:[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-schedule-35)

*   Groups A, B, E, F: [Al Bayt Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Bayt_Stadium "Al Bayt Stadium"), [Khalifa International Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalifa_International_Stadium "Khalifa International Stadium"), [Al Thumama Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Thumama_Stadium "Al Thumama Stadium"), [Ahmad bin Ali Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_bin_Ali_Stadium "Ahmad bin Ali Stadium")
*   Groups C, D, G, H: [Lusail Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusail_Stadium "Lusail Stadium"), [Stadium 974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium_974 "Stadium 974"), [Education City Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_City_Stadium "Education City Stadium"), [Al Janoub Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Janoub_Stadium "Al Janoub Stadium")

FIFA confirmed the group stage venue and kick-off times on 1 April 2022, following the draw.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-36)[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-37)

### Prize money

In April 2022, FIFA announced the prizes for all participating nations. Each qualified team received $1.5 million before the competition to cover preparation costs with each team receiving at least $9 million in prize money. This edition's total prize pool was $440 million, $40 million greater than the prize pool of the [previous tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup "2018 FIFA World Cup").[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-38)

| Place | Teams | Amount (in millions) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per team | Total |
| Champions | 1 | $42 | $42 |
| Runners-up | 1 | $30 | $30 |
| Third place | 1 | $27 | $27 |
| Fourth place | 1 | $25 | $25 |
| 5th–8th place (quarter-finals) | 4 | $17 | $68 |
| 9th–16th place (round of 16) | 8 | $13 | $104 |
| 17th–32nd place (group stage) | 16 | $9 | $144 |
| Total | 32 | $440 |

### Rule changes

The tournament featured new [substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football) "Substitute (association football)") rules whereby teams could make up to five substitutions in normal time, and an additional substitution in [extra time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_(sports)#Association_football "Overtime (sports)").[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-39)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-40)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-41) In addition, it was the first World Cup to feature [concussion substitutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitute_(association_football)#Concussion_substitute "Substitute (association football)"), whereby each team was permitted to use a maximum of one concussion substitute during a match. A concussion substitution did not count towards a team's quota of regular substitutions.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-42) Iranian goalkeeper [Alireza Beiranvand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alireza_Beiranvand "Alireza Beiranvand") suffered a concussion in [his country's opening match against England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_B#England_vs_Iran "2022 FIFA World Cup Group B") and was replaced by [Hossein Hosseini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hossein_Hosseini_(footballer,_born_1992) "Hossein Hosseini (footballer, born 1992)"). This was the first use of a dedicated concussion substitute during a World Cup.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-43)

Russian President [Vladimir Putin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin "Vladimir Putin") handing over the symbolic relay baton for the hosting rights of the 2022 FIFA World Cup to Qatar's Emir [Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamim_bin_Hamad_Al_Thani "Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani") in June 2018.

The [bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_and_2022_FIFA_World_Cup_bids "2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids") began in January 2009. National associations had until 2 February 2009 to register interest.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-44) Initially, 11 bids were made for the [2018 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup "2018 FIFA World Cup"), but Mexico withdrew from proceedings,[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-45)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-46) and [Indonesia's bid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia_2022_FIFA_World_Cup_bid "Indonesia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid") was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian Football Association failed to submit a letter of [Indonesian government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Indonesia "Government of Indonesia") guarantee to support the bid.[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-reject-47)

After [UEFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA "UEFA") were guaranteed to host the 2018 event, members of UEFA were no longer in contention to host in 2022.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-48) There were five bids remaining for the 2022 FIFA World Cup: Australia, Japan, Qatar, South Korea, and the United States. The 22-member [FIFA Executive Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Executive_Committee "FIFA Executive Committee") convened in [Zürich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z%C3%BCrich "Zürich"), Switzerland, on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-2018+2022_bids-49)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-50) Two FIFA executive committee members were suspended before the vote in relation to allegations of corruption regarding their votes.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-51) The decision to host the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, which was graded as having "high operational risk",[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-52) generated criticism from media commentators.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-53) It was criticised by many as being part of the FIFA corruption scandals,[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-54) which led to the [2015 FIFA corruption case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_FIFA_corruption_case "2015 FIFA corruption case").

The voting patterns were as follows:[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-55)

2022 FIFA bidding (majority 12 votes) | Bidders | Votes |
| --- | --- |
| Round 1 | Round 2 | Round 3 | Round 4 |
| **Qatar** | 11 | 10 | 11 | 14 |
| United States | 3 | 5 | 6 | 8 |
| South Korea | 4 | 5 | 5 | Eliminated |
| Japan | 3 | 2 | Eliminated |
| Australia | 1 | Eliminated |

### Cost of hosting the tournament

At an estimated cost of over $220 billion,[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-56) it is the most expensive World Cup ever held to date; this figure is disputed by Qatari officials, including organising [CEO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO "CEO") Nasser Al Khater, who said the true cost was $8 billion, and other figures related to overall infrastructure development since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-57)

Seven of the eight venues, including [Lusail Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusail_Stadium "Lusail Stadium"), the venue for the final, were new stadiums built specifically for the 2022 FIFA World Cup. The eighth was heavily renovated.

The first five proposed venues for the World Cup were unveiled at the beginning of March 2010. Qatar intended that the stadiums should reflect its history and culture, and for the designs to meet the following terms of reference: legacy, comfort, accessibility, and sustainability.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-58) The stadiums were equipped with cooling systems that aim to reduce temperatures within the stadium by up to 20°C (36°F).[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-auto32-59)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-auto8-60)

Their marketing included statements describing the stadiums as [zero waste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_waste "Zero waste"), and the upper tiers of the stadiums will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-auto32-59)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-auto8-60) Qatar aspired to be compliant and certified by the [Global Sustainability Assessment System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Sustainability_Assessment_System "Global Sustainability Assessment System") (GSAS) for all the World Cup stadiums. All of the five stadium projects launched were designed by German architect [Albert Speer & Partners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Speer_Jr. "Albert Speer Jr.").[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-61) The Al Bayt and Al Wakrah stadiums were the only indoor stadiums of the eight used.[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-62)

[![Image 25](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_Qatar_0%E2%80%932_Ecuador_-_%2821%29.jpg/250px-2022_FIFA_World_Cup_Qatar_0%E2%80%932_Ecuador_-_%2821%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:2022_FIFA_World_Cup_Qatar_0%E2%80%932_Ecuador_-_(21).jpg)

Some venues, such as the 68,000-seat [Al Bayt Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Bayt_Stadium "Al Bayt Stadium"), were planned to have their upper tiers of seating removed to reduce capacity after the tournament, however this is yet to happen.

In an April 2013 report by [Merrill Lynch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merrill_Lynch "Merrill Lynch"), the organisers in Qatar requested that FIFA approve a smaller number of stadiums due to the growing costs.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-63)[Bloomberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloomberg_News "Bloomberg News") said that Qatar wished to cut the number of venues to eight or nine from the twelve originally planned.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-64) By April 2017, FIFA had yet to finalise the number of stadiums Qatar must have readied in five years' time. Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy (SC) said it expected there would be eight in and near [Doha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha "Doha"), with the exception of Al Khor.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-65)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-66)

Eight stadiums in five Qatari cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup. Between 2010 (when Qatar were announced as hosts) and 2022, seven of the eight stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the [Khalifa International Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalifa_International_Stadium "Khalifa International Stadium") was renovated for the tournament.

*   Al Khor: Al Bayt Stadium (new). The first piles were driven into the ground in 2014. On 30 November 2021 it hosted its first match.
*   Lusail: Lusail Stadium (new). The construction of the stadium was started on 11 April 2017. It was completed on 21 November 2021.
*   Al Rayyan: Ahmad bin Ali Stadium (new). The stadium was built on the demolished [former stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_bin_Ali_Stadium_(original) "Ahmed bin Ali Stadium (original)") site. It was commissioned on 18 December 2020.
*   Al Rayyan: Education City Stadium (new). It was completed on 15 June 2020.
*   Al Rayyan: Khalifa International Stadium (heavily renovated). The largest stadium in the country at the time, it was closed for renovation in 2014. It was commissioned in May 2017.
*   Doha: Al Thumama Stadium (new). Construction was completed on 21 October 2021.
*   Doha: Stadium 974 (new). Construction commenced in 2018. It was completed on 30 November 2021 and had hosted some of the matches in 2021 FIFA Arab Cup.
*   Al Wakrah: Al Janoub Stadium (new). Construction officially started in 2014 and was completed on 16 May 2019.

Of these eight stadiums, all but two have since been either dismantled, or have been moderately or heavily modified. The [Stadium 974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium_974 "Stadium 974") was supposed to be dismantled after the tournament; as of November 2024 however, this has not happened and the stadium has sat abandoned in its original site—this stadium was the first planned temporary stadium ever used for a FIFA World Cup.[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-67)[Lusail Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusail_Stadium "Lusail Stadium"), [Al Bayt Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Bayt_Stadium "Al Bayt Stadium"), [Ahmad bin Ali Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_bin_Ali_Stadium "Ahmad bin Ali Stadium"), [Education City Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_City_Stadium "Education City Stadium"), [Al Thumama Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Thumama_Stadium "Al Thumama Stadium") and [Al Janoub Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Janoub_Stadium "Al Janoub Stadium") will be moderately or heavily modified as reduce their capacity by half.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-68) The [Khalifa International Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalifa_International_Stadium "Khalifa International Stadium") (latter along with the [Stadium 974](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium_974 "Stadium 974")) are the only largely unmodified stadium that were used for this tournament.

### Team base camps

Base camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. In July 2022, FIFA announced the hotels and training sites for each participating team.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-85)[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-86) This World Cup was the most compact since the inaugural edition [in 1930](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1930_FIFA_World_Cup "1930 FIFA World Cup"), with 24 of the 32 teams being within a 10 km radius of each other, and are concentrated within the [Doha Area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha_Metropolitan_Area "Doha Metropolitan Area"). It was the first Cup since 1930 in which players did not need to take flights to matches and could remain at the same training base throughout the entire tournament.[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-campsa2-87)[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-campsb2-88)

Not a FIFA member

FIFA's [six continental confederations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_confederations "FIFA confederations") organised their own [qualifying competitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_qualification "FIFA World Cup qualification"). All 211 [FIFA member associations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FIFA_member_associations "List of FIFA member associations") were eligible to enter qualification.

*   The [Qatari national team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_national_football_team "Qatar national football team"), as hosts, qualified automatically for the tournament. They still participated in the Asian qualifying stage as the first two rounds also acted as [qualification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_AFC_Asian_Cup_qualification "2023 AFC Asian Cup qualification") for the [2023 AFC Asian Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_AFC_Asian_Cup "2023 AFC Asian Cup").[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-92) Since Qatar reached the final stage as winners in their group, [Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon_national_football_team "Lebanon national football team"), the fifth-best second place team, advanced instead.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-93) Qatar were the only team making their debut in the FIFA World Cup, becoming the first hosts to make their tournament debut since [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team "Italy national football team") in [1934](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1934_FIFA_World_Cup "1934 FIFA World Cup").
*   Of the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2022 FIFA World Cup, 24 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2018,[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-94) including [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team "France national football team"), the reigning [World Cup champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FIFA_World_Cup_finals "List of FIFA World Cup finals"),[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-95) who qualified for the event through European qualification rather than automatically as champions.
*   The [Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_national_football_team "Netherlands national football team"), [Ecuador](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecuador_national_football_team "Ecuador national football team"), [Ghana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana_national_football_team "Ghana national football team"), [Cameroon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameroon_national_football_team "Cameroon national football team"), and the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men%27s_national_soccer_team "United States men's national soccer team") returned to the tournament after missing the 2018 edition.
*   [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_men%27s_national_soccer_team "Canada men's national soccer team") returned after 36 years, their only prior appearance being in [1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_FIFA_World_Cup "1986 FIFA World Cup").[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-96)
*   [Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales_national_football_team "Wales national football team") made their first appearance in 64 years, the longest-ever gap for any team; their only previous participation having been in [1958](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_FIFA_World_Cup "1958 FIFA World Cup").[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-:7-97)
*   [Ghana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana_national_football_team "Ghana national football team") were the lowest ranked team to qualify, ranked 61st.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-98)
*   [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italy_national_football_team "Italy national football team"), four-time winners and [reigning European champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2020_Final "UEFA Euro 2020 Final"), failed to qualify for a second successive World Cup for the first time in their history, losing in the [qualification play-off semi-finals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_%E2%80%93_UEFA_second_round#Semi-finals_3 "2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA second round").[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-99) The Italians were the only former champions and the highest ranked team in the [FIFA Men's World Rankings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Men%27s_World_Ranking "FIFA Men's World Ranking") that failed to qualify. Italy were also the fourth team to have failed to qualify for the upcoming World Cup after having won the previous [UEFA European Championship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_European_Championship "UEFA European Championship"), following [Czechoslovakia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czechoslovakia_national_football_team "Czechoslovakia national football team") in [1978](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_FIFA_World_Cup "1978 FIFA World Cup"), [Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark_national_football_team "Denmark national football team") in [1994](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_FIFA_World_Cup "1994 FIFA World Cup"), and [Greece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greece_national_football_team "Greece national football team") in [2006](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006_FIFA_World_Cup "2006 FIFA World Cup").[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-100)

### Squads

Main article: [2022 FIFA World Cup squads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_squads "2022 FIFA World Cup squads")

Before submitting their final squad for the tournament, teams named a provisional squad of up to 55 players. Teams were required to have their 55-player roster submitted to FIFA by 21 October.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-107) Teams were required to name their final squads by 13 November.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-108) In August 2022, FIFA increased the final squad size to 26 players from a total of 23 players at the [2018 World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup "2018 FIFA World Cup").[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-109) All teams had a total of 26 players in their final squads except for [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/France_national_football_team "France national football team") and [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_national_football_team "Iran national football team"), who chose 25 players.[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-110)[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-111)

### Draw

Main article: [2022 FIFA World Cup seeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_seeding "2022 FIFA World Cup seeding")

The final draw was held at the Doha Exhibition and Convention Center in [Doha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha "Doha"), Qatar,[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-112) on 1 April 2022,[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-113) 19:00 [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabia_Standard_Time "Arabia Standard Time"), prior to the completion of [qualification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification "2022 FIFA World Cup qualification"). The two winners of the [inter-confederation play-offs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_(inter-confederation_play-offs) "2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (inter-confederation play-offs)") and the winner of the [Path A of the UEFA play-offs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_%E2%80%93_UEFA_second_round#Path_A "2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA second round") were not known at the time of the draw.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-114) The draw was attended by 2,000 guests and was led by [Carli Lloyd](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carli_Lloyd "Carli Lloyd"), [Jermaine Jenas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jermaine_Jenas "Jermaine Jenas") and sports broadcaster Samantha Johnson, assisted by the likes of [Cafu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cafu "Cafu") (Brazil), [Lothar Matthäus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothar_Matth%C3%A4us "Lothar Matthäus") (Germany), [Adel Ahmed Malalla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adel_Ahmed_Malalla "Adel Ahmed Malalla") (Qatar), [Ali Daei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Daei "Ali Daei") (Iran), [Bora Milutinović](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bora_Milutinovi%C4%87 "Bora Milutinović") (Serbia/Mexico), [Jay-Jay Okocha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay-Jay_Okocha "Jay-Jay Okocha") (Nigeria), [Rabah Madjer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabah_Madjer "Rabah Madjer") (Algeria), and [Tim Cahill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cahill "Tim Cahill") (Australia).[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-drawProcedure-115)[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-116)

For the draw, 32 teams were allocated into four pots based on the [FIFA Men's World Rankings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Men%27s_World_Rankings "FIFA Men's World Rankings") of 31 March 2022.[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-117) Pot 1 contained host Qatar (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams. Pot 2 contained the next best eight teams, with the next best eight teams into pot 3. Pot 4 contained the five lowest-ranked teams, along with the placeholders for the two inter-confederation play-off winners and the UEFA Path A play-off winner. Teams from the same confederation could not be drawn into the same group except for UEFA teams, for which there was at least one and no more than two per group.[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-auto2-118)

This principle also applied to the placeholder teams, with constraints applying based on the confederation of both potential winners of each play-off tie. The draw started with pot 1 and ended with pot 4, with each team selected then allocated into the first available group alphabetically. The position for the team within the group would then be drawn (for the purpose of the [match schedule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#Schedule)), with the pot 1 teams automatically drawn into position 1 of each group.[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-auto2-118) The pots for the draw are shown below.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-needtoknow-119)

Main article: [2022 FIFA World Cup officials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_officials "2022 FIFA World Cup officials")

In May 2022, FIFA announced the list of 36 referees, 69 assistant referees, and 24 [video assistant referees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_assistant_referee "Video assistant referee") for the tournament. Of the 36 referees, FIFA included two each from Argentina, Brazil, England, and France.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-124)[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-125)

For the first time women referees officiated games at a major men's tournament.[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-126) France's [Stéphanie Frappart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St%C3%A9phanie_Frappart "Stéphanie Frappart"), [Salima Mukansanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salima_Mukansanga "Salima Mukansanga") from Rwanda, and [Yoshimi Yamashita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshimi_Yamashita "Yoshimi Yamashita") from Japan became the first female referees to be appointed to a men's World Cup.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-127) Frappart previously oversaw the [2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup_Final "2019 FIFA Women's World Cup Final").[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-128) They were joined by three female assistant referees, Neuza Back, Kathryn Nesbitt, and Karen Díaz Medina. Frappart then officially became the first-ever female referee to officiate a World Cup match when she worked the [Costa Rica vs Germany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_E#Costa_Rica_vs_Germany "2022 FIFA World Cup Group E") match in [Group E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_E "2022 FIFA World Cup Group E") on 1 December.[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-129)

Gambian referee [Bakary Gassama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakary_Gassama "Bakary Gassama") and Argentine assistant referee Juan Pablo Belatti were among the officials to serve at their third World Cup. Belatti was an assistant referee in the [2018 final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_Final "2018 FIFA World Cup Final").[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-130)[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-131)[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-132) Other returning officials included referees [César Arturo Ramos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9sar_Arturo_Ramos "César Arturo Ramos") of Mexico and [Janny Sikazwe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janny_Sikazwe "Janny Sikazwe") of Zambia, and Iranian assistant referee [Mohammadreza Mansouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammadreza_Mansouri "Mohammadreza Mansouri").[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-133)[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-134)[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-135)

On 15 December 2022, FIFA announced that [Polish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_Football_Association "Polish Football Association") referee [Szymon Marciniak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Szymon_Marciniak "Szymon Marciniak") would adjudicate the final.[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-136)

### Group A

Main article: [2022 FIFA World Cup Group A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_A "2022 FIFA World Cup Group A")

The first match of the tournament was held between Qatar and Ecuador in Group A. Ecuador had a disallowed goal in the opening minutes,[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-144) but eventually won 2–0 with two goals from [Enner Valencia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enner_Valencia "Enner Valencia").[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-145) Qatar became the first host nation to lose their opening match at a World Cup.[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-146)[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-147)[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-148) Many Qatar natives were seen leaving the game before the end, with [ESPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESPN "ESPN") reporting that two-thirds of the attendance had left.[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-149)[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-150) The other starting match in group A was won by the Netherlands 2–0 over Senegal. [Cody Gakpo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cody_Gakpo "Cody Gakpo") scored the opening goal in the 84th minute and [Davy Klaassen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Davy_Klaassen "Davy Klaassen") added a second in stoppage time.[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-151) Senegal faced Qatar in the third match of the group; [Boulaye Dia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulaye_Dia "Boulaye Dia") capitalised on a slip by [Boualem Khoukhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boualem_Khoukhi "Boualem Khoukhi") to put Senegal 1–0 ahead. [Famara Diédhiou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Famara_Di%C3%A9dhiou "Famara Diédhiou") scored a second with a header, before [Mohammed Muntari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Muntari "Mohammed Muntari") scored Qatar's first-ever goal at a World Cup to reduce the deficit back to one. Senegal eventually won the match 3–1 after an 84th-minute goal by [Bamba Dieng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamba_Dieng "Bamba Dieng"). With this result, Qatar became the first team to be eliminated from the tournament, as well as becoming the first host nation to ever be knocked out of the tournament after two games.[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-152) Gakpo scored his second goal of the tournament as the Netherlands led Ecuador; however, Valencia scored an equaliser in the 49th minute.[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-153) The Netherlands won 2–0 against Qatar following goals by Gakpo and [Frenkie de Jong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenkie_de_Jong "Frenkie de Jong") to win the group, while Qatar attained the distinction of being the first home nation to lose all three group matches.[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-154) Senegal faced Ecuador to determine the second knockout round qualifier. At the end of the first half, [Ismaïla Sarr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isma%C3%AFla_Sarr "Ismaïla Sarr") scored a penalty kick to put Senegal ahead. In the 67th minute, [Moisés Caicedo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mois%C3%A9s_Caicedo "Moisés Caicedo") scored an equaliser, but shortly after, [Kalidou Koulibaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalidou_Koulibaly "Kalidou Koulibaly") gave Senegal the victory. The win was enough to qualify Senegal as the runners-up of Group A.[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-155)

### Group D

Main article: [2022 FIFA World Cup Group D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_D "2022 FIFA World Cup Group D")

The match between Denmark and Tunisia ended as a goalless draw; both teams had goals disallowed by offside calls.[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-SKYDenTun-172) Danish midfielder [Christian Eriksen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Eriksen "Christian Eriksen") made his first major international appearance since suffering a cardiac arrest at the [UEFA Euro 2020](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UEFA_Euro_2020 "UEFA Euro 2020").[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-SKYDenTun-172) Defending champions France went a goal behind to Australia, after a [Craig Goodwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Goodwin "Craig Goodwin") goal within ten minutes. France, however, scored four goals, by [Adrien Rabiot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrien_Rabiot "Adrien Rabiot"), [Kylian Mbappé](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylian_Mbapp%C3%A9 "Kylian Mbappé") and two by [Olivier Giroud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Giroud "Olivier Giroud") to win 4–1.[[168]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-GuardianFraAus-173) The goals tied Giroud with [Thierry Henry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thierry_Henry "Thierry Henry") as France's all-time top goalscorer.[[168]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-GuardianFraAus-173)[Mitchell Duke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Duke "Mitchell Duke") scored the only goal as Australia won against Tunisia. This was their first World Cup win since 2010.[[169]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-auto4-174)[[170]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-175) Mbappé scored a brace as France defeated Denmark 2–1. This was enough for France to qualify for the knockout round—the first time since Brazil in 2006 that the defending champions progressed through the opening round.[[169]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-auto4-174)[[171]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-176)[Mathew Leckie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Leckie "Mathew Leckie") scored the only goal as Australia defeated Denmark 1–0, qualifying for the knockout round as runners-up with the win.[[172]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-177)[Wahbi Khazri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wahbi_Khazri "Wahbi Khazri") scored for Tunisia against France in the 58th minute. Although [Antoine Griezmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_Griezmann "Antoine Griezmann") equalised in stoppage time it was overturned for offside. Tunisia finished third in the group, as they required a draw in the Denmark and Australia game.[[173]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-178)

### Group E

Main article: [2022 FIFA World Cup Group E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_E "2022 FIFA World Cup Group E")

Group E began with Japan facing [2014 champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup "2014 FIFA World Cup") Germany. After an early penalty kick was converted by Germany's [İlkay Gündoğan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%B0lkay_G%C3%BCndo%C4%9Fan "İlkay Gündoğan"), Japan scored two second-half goals by [Ritsu Dōan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritsu_D%C5%8Dan "Ritsu Dōan") and [Takuma Asano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takuma_Asano "Takuma Asano") in a 2–1 win.[[174]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-179) In the second group match, Spain defeated Costa Rica 7–0. First-half goals by [Dani Olmo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dani_Olmo "Dani Olmo"), [Marco Asensio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marco_Asensio "Marco Asensio"), and [Ferran Torres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferran_Torres "Ferran Torres") were followed by goals by [Gavi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavi_(footballer) "Gavi (footballer)"), [Carlos Soler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Soler_(footballer) "Carlos Soler (footballer)"), [Alvaro Morata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alvaro_Morata "Alvaro Morata"), and a second by Torres.[[175]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-180)[[176]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-181) This was the largest defeat in a World Cup since Portugal's victory over North Korea in the [2010 event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup "2010 FIFA World Cup") by the same scoreline.[[177]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-182) Costa Rica defeated Japan 1–0, with [Keysher Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keysher_Fuller "Keysher Fuller") scoring with Costa Rica's first shot on target of the tournament.[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-183) Germany and Spain drew 1–1, with [Álvaro Morata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lvaro_Morata "Álvaro Morata") scoring for Spain and [Niclas Füllkrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niclas_F%C3%BCllkrug "Niclas Füllkrug") scoring for Germany.[[179]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-184)[[180]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-185)[[181]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-186) Morata scored the opening goal for Spain against Japan as they controlled the first half of the match.[[182]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-:10-187) Japan equalised on [Ritsu Doan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritsu_Doan "Ritsu Doan") before a second goal by [Ao Tanaka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ao_Tanaka "Ao Tanaka") was heavily investigated by VAR for the ball potentially being out of play.[[183]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-Bunshun.jp_interview_Josek-188) The goal was awarded, and Japan won the group following a 2–1 win. Disputes over the VAR's call was only settled when the [Associated Press](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press "Associated Press") released an iconic [bird's eye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird%27s_eye_view "Bird's eye view") photo of the ball after the match.[[183]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-Bunshun.jp_interview_Josek-188)[Serge Gnabry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serge_Gnabry "Serge Gnabry") scored on ten minutes for Germany against Costa Rica and they led until half-time. Germany required a win, and for Japan to not win their match, or for both teams to win their matches by a combined goal difference of at least 9 goals, to qualify. In the second half, goals by [Yeltsin Tejeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeltsin_Tejeda "Yeltsin Tejeda") and [Juan Vargas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Pablo_Vargas "Juan Pablo Vargas") gave Costa Rica a 2–1 lead, which would have qualified them into the knockout stages ahead of Spain. Germany scored three further goals—two by [Kai Havertz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Havertz "Kai Havertz") and a goal by [Niclas Fullkrug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niclas_Fullkrug "Niclas Fullkrug"), ending in a 4–2 win for Germany—which was not enough to qualify them for the final stages. This was the second time in a row that the four-time champions failed to progress past the group stages.[[184]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-189) Japan won the group ahead of Spain.[[185]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-190)

### Group H

Main article: [2022 FIFA World Cup Group H](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_Group_H "2022 FIFA World Cup Group H")

Uruguay and South Korea played to a goalless draw.[[201]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-206) A goalless first half between Portugal and Ghana preceded a penalty converted by [Cristiano Ronaldo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristiano_Ronaldo "Cristiano Ronaldo") to give Portugal the lead. In scoring the goal, Ronaldo became the first man to score in five World Cups. Ghana responded with a goal by [André Ayew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Ayew "André Ayew") before goals by [João Félix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jo%C3%A3o_F%C3%A9lix "João Félix"), and [Rafael Leão](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rafael_Le%C3%A3o "Rafael Leão") by Portugal put them 3–1 ahead. [Osman Bukari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osman_Bukari "Osman Bukari") scored in the 89th minute to trail by a single goal, while [Iñaki Williams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I%C3%B1aki_Williams "Iñaki Williams") had a chance to equalise for Ghana ten minutes into stoppage time, but slipped before shooting. The match finished 3–2 to Portugal.[[202]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-207) Ghanaian [Mohammed Salisu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Salisu "Mohammed Salisu") opened the scoring against South Korea, with [Mohammed Kudus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Kudus "Mohammed Kudus") following it up. In the second half, [Cho Gue-sung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cho_Gue-sung "Cho Gue-sung") scored a brace for South Korea, levelling the score. Mohammed Kudus scored again in the 68th minute, winning the match 3–2 for Ghana.[[203]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-208) Portugal defeated Uruguay 2–0 with two goals from [Bruno Fernandes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Fernandes "Bruno Fernandes"), advancing them to the knockout stage.[[204]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-209) A controversial penalty decision was called late in the game, with a suspected handball from [José María Giménez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Mar%C3%ADa_Gim%C3%A9nez "José María Giménez").[[205]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-210)[[206]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-211) Portugal led South Korea through [Ricardo Horta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Horta "Ricardo Horta") after 10 minutes. However, goals by [Kim Young-gwon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Young-gwon "Kim Young-gwon") and [Hwang Hee-chan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hwang_Hee-chan "Hwang Hee-chan") won the match 2–1 for South Korea.[[207]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-212)[Giorgian de Arrascaeta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgian_de_Arrascaeta "Giorgian de Arrascaeta") scored two goals as Uruguay defeated Ghana 2–0.[[208]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-213) However, with South Korea winning, Uruguay required another goal to progress as they finished third on goals scored.[[209]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-214) Several Uruguay players left the pitch after the game surrounding the referees and followed them off the pitch.[[210]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-215)[[211]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-216)[[212]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-217)

### Quarter-finals

The quarter-finals were played on 9 and 10 December.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-schedule-35) Croatia and Brazil ended 0–0 after 90 minutes and went to extra time. Neymar scored for Brazil in the 15th minute of extra time. Croatia, however, equalised through [Bruno Petković](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruno_Petkovi%C4%87 "Bruno Petković") in the second period of extra time. With the match tied, a penalty shootout decided the contest, with Croatia winning the shootout 4–2.[[222]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-227)[[223]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-228) In the second quarter-final match, [Nahuel Molina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahuel_Molina "Nahuel Molina") and Messi scored for Argentina before [Wout Weghorst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wout_Weghorst "Wout Weghorst") equalised with two goals shortly before the end of the game. The match went to extra time and then penalties, where Argentina would go on to win 4–3.[[224]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-229) Morocco defeated Portugal 1–0, with [Youssef En-Nesyri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youssef_En-Nesyri "Youssef En-Nesyri") scoring at the end of the first half. Morocco became the first African and the first Arab nation to advance as far as the semi-finals of the competition.[[225]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-230) Despite [Harry Kane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Kane "Harry Kane") scoring a penalty for England, it was not enough to beat France, who won 2–1 by virtue of goals from [Aurélien Tchouaméni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aur%C3%A9lien_Tchouam%C3%A9ni "Aurélien Tchouaméni") and [Olivier Giroud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olivier_Giroud "Olivier Giroud") and a late missed penalty by Kane, sending them to their second consecutive World Cup semi-final and becoming the first defending champions to reach this stage since Brazil in 1998.[[226]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-231)[[227]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-232)

### Final

Main article: [2022 FIFA World Cup final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_final "2022 FIFA World Cup final")

The final was played on 18 December between Argentina and France. Both teams had won the event twice previously.[[232]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-final1-237) Early goals from Lionel Messi and [Ángel Di María](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81ngel_Di_Mar%C3%ADa "Ángel Di María") gave Argentina, leading 2–0, a head start against the French.[[232]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-final1-237)[[233]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-final2-238) Despite substitutions in the first half, France did not record a shot until after the 70th minute but were energised by additional substitutions in the 71st. A few minutes later, France were awarded a penalty as [Randal Kolo Muani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randal_Kolo_Muani "Randal Kolo Muani") was brought down in the penalty area by [Nicolás Otamendi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicol%C3%A1s_Otamendi "Nicolás Otamendi"). Mbappé scored the penalty and added a second goal less than two minutes later to equalise the scores.[[233]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-final2-238) With the score tied at two goals apiece, the match went to extra time. Messi scored his second goal in the 108th minute, once again giving Argentina the lead. However, Mbappé was awarded a second penalty in the 115th minute after his shot hit the arm of [Gonzalo Montiel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gonzalo_Montiel "Gonzalo Montiel"). Mbappé scored his third goal, becoming the second player ever to complete a [hat-trick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hat-trick "Hat-trick") in the final of a World Cup after [Geoff Hurst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoff_Hurst "Geoff Hurst") for England in [1966](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1966_FIFA_World_Cup "1966 FIFA World Cup").[[233]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-final2-238) With the score tied at 3–3, the match was determined via a penalty shootout. Argentina won the final after scoring all of their penalties, winning 4–2.[[233]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-final2-238) This marked their third World Cup win and their first since [1986](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1986_FIFA_World_Cup "1986 FIFA World Cup"), and also the second team (after [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spain_national_football_team "Spain national football team") in [2010](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_FIFA_World_Cup "2010 FIFA World Cup")) to win the tournament after having lost their opening game.[[233]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-final2-238)

### Branding

The official emblem was designed by Unlock Brands[[250]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-255) and unveiled in September 2019, during simultaneous events at the [Doha Tower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha_Tower "Doha Tower"), [Katara Cultural Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katara_Cultural_Village "Katara Cultural Village") amphitheatre, [Msheireb Downtown Doha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Msheireb_Downtown_Doha "Msheireb Downtown Doha"), and [Zubarah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zubarah "Zubarah"). It is based on a [shawl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawl "Shawl") (reflecting upon the tournament's late-Autumn scheduling) and desert [dunes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune "Dune"), and was shaped to resemble the [tournament trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_Trophy "FIFA World Cup Trophy"), the [infinity symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity_symbol "Infinity symbol"), and the number "8"—reflecting upon the "interconnected" event and the eight host stadiums. The typography of the emblem's [wordmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordmark "Wordmark") incorporated [kashida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashida "Kashida")—the practice of elongating certain parts of characters in [Arabic script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_script "Arabic script") to provide typographical emphasis.[[251]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-256)[[252]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-257)[[253]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-258)

H.E Ambassador Dr. Hend Al-Muftah, Permanent Representative of the State of Qatar to the United Nations Office at Geneva, explained to [WIPO Magazine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIPO_Magazine "WIPO Magazine") that the tournament provided an opportunity to "promote our culture and showcase our signature hospitality in a multicultural environment", and highlighted that the country has [used sports to](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_and_sports "Politics and sports") demonstrate its "commitment to sustainable development, social inclusion and the values of community and mutual respect among peoples from different cultures and nations."[[254]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-259)

### Mascot

Main article: [La'eeb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La%27eeb "La'eeb")

The tournament's [official mascot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_mascot "FIFA World Cup mascot") was unveiled on 1 April 2022, during the group stage draw. Its name is "Laʼeeb" ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): لعيب, [romanised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic "Romanization of Arabic"):_Laʿīb_), which is an Arabic word meaning "super-skilled player". The official website of FIFA says: "Laʼeeb will be known for his youthful spirit; spreading joy and confidence everywhere he goes", and the official backstory of the character, published there, claims that it comes from a parallel world where tournament mascots live, "a world where ideas and creativity form the basis of characters that live in the minds of everyone".[[294]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-299)

Adidas Al Hilm

The first official match ball, "[Adidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas "Adidas") Al Rihla", was unveiled on 30 March 2022. It was mainly inspired by the culture, architecture, iconic boats and flag of Qatar. In Arabic, the word _Al-Rihla_ (الْرِّحْلَة _ar-riḥla_) means "the journey". The ball was designed with sustainability as a priority, making it the first-ever official match ball created with water-based glues and inks. As "the game is getting faster" and "speeds up", the ball has internal electronic sensors, allowing detection of its speed and position, updated 500 times per second[[295]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-300) and it has to be charged before each game.[[296]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-301) Two of the match balls were sent and returned from space by FIFA and [Qatar Airways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_Airways "Qatar Airways") on a [SpaceX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX "SpaceX")[falcon 9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falcon_9 "Falcon 9")[suborbital mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sub-orbital_spaceflight "Sub-orbital spaceflight") for promoting the World Cup.[[297]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-302)

The match ball for the semi-finals, third place play-off and [final](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_final "2022 FIFA World Cup final") was announced on 11 December 2022. It is a variation of the Al Rihla named the "Adidas Al Hilm _"_ ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language "Arabic language"): الحلم, [romanised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Arabic "Romanization of Arabic"):_al-ḥulm_, [lit.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_translation "Literal translation")''the dream'', a reference to "every nation's dream of lifting the FIFA World Cup").[[298]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-303) While the technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from the Al Rihla balls used in the group stages and preceding knockout games, with a _Gold Metallic_, maroon, _Collegiate Burgundy_, and red design,[[299]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-304) a reference to the [national colours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Qatar "Flag of Qatar") of host nation [Qatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar "Qatar") and the golden colours shared by the Final's [venue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lusail_Stadium "Lusail Stadium") and the [FIFA World Cup Trophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup_Trophy "FIFA World Cup Trophy").[[300]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-2022-03-30-fifa-305)

Controversies
-------------

Main article: [List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2022_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies "List of 2022 FIFA World Cup controversies")

Criticism of the 2022 FIFA World Cup focused on Qatar's [human-rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Qatar "Human rights in Qatar") record,[[309]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-foreignpolicy3-314) namely their [treatment of migrant workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies#Human_rights_concern "2022 FIFA World Cup controversies"),[[309]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-foreignpolicy3-314) women, and [position on LGBT rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Qatar "LGBT rights in Qatar"),[[310]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-JPost_2022-315) leading to allegations of [sportswashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sportswashing "Sportswashing").[[F]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-319) Others cited Qatar's climate, lack of a strong football culture, and allegations of bribery for hosting rights and [wider FIFA corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_FIFA_corruption_case "2015 FIFA corruption case").[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-Reason_2022-8)[[314]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-Atlantic_20222-320)[Boycotts of the event](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_controversies#Boycotts "2022 FIFA World Cup controversies") were declared by several countries, clubs, and individual players,[[312]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-Dhaka_2022-317)[[313]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-Comercio_2022-318) with former FIFA president [Sepp Blatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp_Blatter "Sepp Blatter") twice stating that giving Qatar hosting rights was a "mistake".[[315]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-321)[[316]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-322) The FIFA World Cup delivered record-breaking numbers of TV audiences across multiple markets.[[317]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-323) In June 2023, _[Le Point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le\_Point "Le Point")_ revealed that FIFA World Cup has raised great interest in the country despite "calls for a [boycott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boycott "Boycott")". According to the study by _Arcom_, six out of ten French people followed at least one match.[[318]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-324)

### Host selection criticism

There have been allegations of bribery and corruption in the selection process involving FIFA's executive committee members.[[319]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-325) These allegations are being investigated by FIFA (see [§Bidding corruption allegations, 2014](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#Bidding_corruption_allegations,_2014), below). In May 2011, allegations of corruption within the FIFA senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup 2022 being held in Qatar. The accusations of corruption were made relating to how Qatar won the right to host the event. A FIFA internal investigation and report cleared Qatar of any violation, but chief investigator [Michael J. Garcia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_J._Garcia "Michael J. Garcia") described FIFA's report on his enquiry as containing "numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations."[[320]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-326)

In May 2015, Swiss federal prosecutors [opened an investigation into corruption and money laundering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_FIFA_corruption_case "2015 FIFA corruption case") related to the [2018 and 2022 World Cup bids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_and_2022_FIFA_World_Cup_bids "2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids").[[321]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-327)[[322]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-328) In August 2018, former FIFA president [Sepp Blatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp_Blatter "Sepp Blatter") claimed that Qatar had used "black ops", suggesting that the bid committee had cheated to win the hosting rights.[[323]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-329) Some investigations found that Qatar sought an edge in securing hosting by hiring a former [CIA officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency "Central Intelligence Agency") turned private contractor, Kevin Chalker, to spy on rival bid teams and key football officials who picked the winner in 2010.[[324]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-330)

In September 2018, a delegation from al-Ghufran tribe lodged a complaint to FIFA's president to reject the establishment of the World Cup in Qatar unless its government restored the Qatari nationality to all those affected from the tribe and returned land allegedly stolen from them to build the sport facilities.[[325]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-331)

In September 2023 it was reported that court documents show a transfer of $300M dollars were sent top people who voted on the 2022 World Cup host.[[326]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-332)

Qatar faced strong criticism for the treatment of foreign workers involved in preparation for the World Cup, with [Amnesty International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International "Amnesty International") referring to "forced labour" and poor working conditions,[[327]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-333)[[328]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-334) while many migrant workers reported having to pay large "recruitment fees" to obtain employment.[[329]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-guardian-workers-pay-335)_[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Guardian "The Guardian")_ newspaper reported that many workers were denied food and water, had their identity papers taken away from them, and that they were not paid on time or at all, making some of them in effect slaves. _The Guardian_ estimated that up to 4,000 workers could die from lax safety and other causes by the time the competition was held. Between 2015 and 2021, the [Qatari government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Qatar "Government of Qatar") adopted new labour reforms to improve working conditions, including a minimum wage for all workers and the removal of the [kafala system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafala_system "Kafala system"). Furthermore, in November 2017, the [International Labour Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization "International Labour Organization") concluded that no rights were violated and made the decision to close the complaint against Qatar regarding the alleged violation of migrant workers' rights.[[330]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-336) According to Amnesty International, however, living and working conditions of the foreign workers did not improve in the last years.[[331]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-337)

Qatar was the smallest nation by area ever to have been awarded a FIFA World Cup– the next smallest by area was Switzerland, host of the [1954 World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1954_FIFA_World_Cup "1954 FIFA World Cup"), which was more than three times as large as Qatar and only needed to host 16 teams instead of 32. Qatar also became only the second country (not including Uruguay and Italy, hosts of the first two World Cups) to be awarded a FIFA World Cup despite having never qualified for a previous edition: Japan was awarded co-hosting rights of the [2002 World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_FIFA_World_Cup "2002 FIFA World Cup") in 1996 without ever having qualified for the finals, although they qualified for the [1998 edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1998_FIFA_World_Cup "1998 FIFA World Cup"). Of the eight stadiums used in the tournament, six were located in the [Doha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha "Doha")[metropolitan area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doha_Metropolitan_Area "Doha Metropolitan Area"), making it the first World Cup [since 1930](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1930_FIFA_World_Cup "1930 FIFA World Cup") in which most of the stadiums were in one city. While this decreased the distance that fans and players needed to commute, Qatar itself struggled to accommodate the numbers of arriving fans with its diminutive amount of space.[[332]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-338)

Due to Qatar's [laws on alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_alcohol_prohibition "List of countries with alcohol prohibition"), World Cup organisers announced the creation of designated "sobering-up" zones as an alternative to wide-scale arrests of intoxicated fans during the World Cup.[[333]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-339) Qatar's World Cup chief executive of the Supreme Committee for Delivery and Legacy, Nasser Al Khater, stated that the purpose of the designated sobering-up areas was to ensure the fans' safety.[[334]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-340) If a fan was sent to the "sobering up" zone, they were permitted to leave when they could display clearheaded behaviour.[[335]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-341) Multiple news agencies described the controversy as a "cultural clash" between [social conservatism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_conservatism "Social conservatism") and [Islamic morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality_in_Islam "Morality in Islam") against the "norms" of [secular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secularity "Secularity") Western [liberal democracies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy "Liberal democracy").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-:0-13)[[336]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-:2-342)

A number of groups and media outlets expressed concern over the suitability of Qatar to host the event.[[337]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-343)[[338]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-guardian-344) Issues regarding from [human rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Qatar "Human rights in Qatar"),[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-foreignpolicy-10)[[310]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-JPost_2022-315) worker conditions, the rights of [LGBT fans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_community "LGBT community"),[[310]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-JPost_2022-315) and the [illegality of homosexuality in Qatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Qatar "LGBT rights in Qatar").[[339]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-345)[[340]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-346)[[341]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-347) In December 2020, Qatar said [rainbow flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_flag_(LGBT) "Rainbow flag (LGBT)") would be allowed at the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[[342]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-348) Qatari officials initially stated that they would not prohibit the display of [pride flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_flag "Pride flag") at tournament venues, although the country still advised LGBT attendees to comply with the country's [modesty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modesty "Modesty") and avoid [public displays of affection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_display_of_affection "Public display of affection").[[343]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-:3-349)[[344]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-:4-350) Hassan Abdulla al-Thawadi, chief executive of the country's World Cup bid, said that Qatar would permit [alcohol consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcohol_consumption "Alcohol consumption") during the event,[[345]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-351)[[346]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-sportsgrid-352) even though [drinking in public](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drinking_in_public "Drinking in public") was not permitted.[[347]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-353) There were plans to allow the sale of alcohol inside stadiums and at fan villages.[[348]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-BBC_Sport-354) Normally, the sale of alcohol is restricted to non-Muslim guests at selected luxury hotels only.[[349]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-wsj201201072-355) However, in the months preceding the tournament, the display of LGBT material and the sale of alcohol were banned.[[348]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-BBC_Sport-354)[[350]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-:5-356)[[351]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-:6-357)[[352]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-Financial_Times-358)[[353]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-Reuters2-359)

The climate conditions caused some to call hosting the tournament in Qatar infeasible, with initial plans for air-conditioned stadiums giving way to a potential date switch from summer to November and December.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-Atlantic_2022-7) In May 2014, [Sepp Blatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sepp_Blatter "Sepp Blatter"), who was FIFA president at the time of the selection, remarked that awarding the World Cup to Qatar was a "mistake" because of the extreme heat.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-Atlantic_2022-7)[[354]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-360)[[355]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-361) While addressing delegates from African and Asian confederations, Blatter said allegations of corruption and some of the criticism, including those from sponsors, were "very much linked to racism and discrimination".[[356]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-362) The attendance figures at the matches also came under scrutiny as the reported crowd attendance was more than the stadium capacities despite games having visible empty seats.[[357]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-363)

Prior to the tournament, a reporter for Denmark's [TV 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_2_(Denmark) "TV 2 (Denmark)") was threatened by security during a live report from the [Katara Cultural Village](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katara_Cultural_Village "Katara Cultural Village"); the organising committee apologised, stating that they were "mistakenly interrupted".[[358]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-364)[Tony O'Donoghue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_O%27Donoghue "Tony O'Donoghue") of Ireland's [RTÉ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RT%C3%89 "RTÉ") also accused Qatari police of interrupting him while filming.[[359]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-365)

[Phaedra Almajid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phaedra_Al-Majid "Phaedra Al-Majid"), a former media officer for Qatar's 2022 World Cup bid, has alleged that three African football officials were offered bribes to support Qatar's bid. In a Netflix documentary series "[FIFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA "FIFA") Uncovered," Almajid claims that [Hassan Al Thawadi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_Al-Thawadi "Hassan Al-Thawadi"), who led Qatar's bid, offered €2.3 million each to [Issa Hayatou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issa_Hayatou "Issa Hayatou") of Cameroon, [Jacques Anouma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Anouma "Jacques Anouma") of Ivory Coast, and [Amos Adamu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Adamu "Amos Adamu") of Nigeria in exchange for their votes. Qatar was competing with Australia, Japan, South Korea and the US for their bid for the 2022 World Cup. The alleged offer was made during a meeting of African football federations in January 2010. Almajid states that the money was intended for the football federations, not as personal bribes. She initially disclosed these allegations anonymously to the [Sunday Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sunday_Times "The Sunday Times") after being dismissed from her position, but later retracted her claims, citing threats from [Qatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar "Qatar"). Al Thawadi has denied these allegations, calling them false and expressing disappointment at the situation. The controversy adds to the ongoing scrutiny surrounding Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup.[[360]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-366)

### Targeted hacking campaigns against critics

On November 2, 2022, Swiss media outlet SRF Investigativ published an investigative piece about Qatar's elaborate and extensive espionage operation to secure the World Cup hosting rights. The operation, which was dubbed [Project Merciless](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Merciless "Project Merciless"), involved hacking emails and phones of FIFA officials and critics of Qatar's corruption and [poor human rights record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Qatar "Human rights in Qatar"). It also targeted their friends and family members to run smear campaigns and influence FIFA policy. Starting on January 5, 2012, a cyberattack targeted Peter Hargitay, a Zurich-based FIFA insider and consultant for Australia's 2022 World Cup bid. Hargitay and his son hired an expert who traced the hack to a server linked to Rajat Khare of the mercenary Indian hack-for-hire firm [Appin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appin_(company) "Appin (company)").[[361]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-SRF-2022-11-02-367)[[362]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-ap-qatar-spy-on-fifa-368)[[363]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-io-rajat-khare-helping-qatar-369)[[364]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-st-buy-the-world-cup-370) In November 2022, a lower court in [Geneva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geneva "Geneva") ordered the publication to provisionally remove Rajat Khare's name and photo from the article.[[365]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-rsf-appin-silencing-media-371) As a result, he is currently referred to as an entrepreneur, though his name still appears in a [Reuters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reuters "Reuters") article about his involvement in the hacking.[[366]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-reuters-special-report-appin-372)

On 5 November 2022, _[The Sunday Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Sunday\_Times "The Sunday Times")_ and the [Bureau of Investigative Journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Investigative_Journalism "Bureau of Investigative Journalism") published an investigation reporting that a group from an Indian hacking company had compromised the email accounts of various politicians, reporters, and other prominent individuals that had been critical of Qatar's hosting of the World Cup. It was also reported that the group had been hired by Jonas Rey, private investigators based in Switzerland, which were in turn hired by Qatari officials.[[367]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-The_Bureau_of_Investigative_Journalism-373)

### Migrant workers

Main article: [Human rights issues involving the 2022 FIFA World Cup §Migrant workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_issues_involving_the_2022_FIFA_World_Cup#Migrant_workers "Human rights issues involving the 2022 FIFA World Cup")

There was criticism regarding the state of [human rights in Qatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_rights_in_Qatar "Human rights in Qatar") and of the conditions of migrant workers brought in to build the required infrastructure, including indentured servitude and working conditions leading to deaths.[[371]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-377) On 23 October 2022, an article published by _[The Guardian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Guardian "The Guardian")_ included statements from migrants working on the event infrastructure. Surveying 1,000 workers, 86% of participants said that the labour changes had improved their lives and that better working conditions are negotiable.[[372]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-378) Legislation has also been proposed on the minimum wage, summertime worker safety, and the election of migrant worker representatives in businesses. Labour mobility is a result of changes to the [Kafala system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kafala_system "Kafala system").[[373]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-379)

According to [Sharan Burrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharan_Burrow "Sharan Burrow"), general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, prior to the tournament, "the new Kafala system tranche of law will put an end to Kafala and establish a contemporary industrial relations system."[[374]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-380)

FIFA President [Gianni Infantino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gianni_Infantino "Gianni Infantino") has defended Qatar's decision to host the tournament.[[375]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-381)_[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Economist "The Economist")_ has asserted that Qatar has a better human rights record than [Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia "Russia") and [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China"), and that the country has received excessive criticism after being selected to host the event.[[376]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-382)

### Move to November and December

Owing to the [climate in Qatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_of_Qatar "Climate of Qatar"), concerns were expressed over holding the World Cup in its traditional time frame of June and July.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-Atlantic_2022-7) In October 2013, a task force was commissioned to consider alternative dates and report after the [2014 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_FIFA_World_Cup "2014 FIFA World Cup") in Brazil.[[377]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-autogenerated4-383) On 24 February 2015, the FIFA Task Force proposed that the tournament be played from late November to late December 2022,[[378]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-fifa_task_force-384) to avoid the summer heat and also avoid clashing with the [2022 Winter Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Winter_Olympics "2022 Winter Olympics") in February, the [2022 Winter Paralympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Winter_Paralympics "2022 Winter Paralympics") in March and [Ramadan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan "Ramadan") in April.[[379]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-385)[[380]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-386)

The notion of staging the tournament in November was controversial because it would interfere with the regular season schedules of some domestic leagues around the world. Commentators noted the clash with the Christian Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, while there was concern about how short the tournament was intended to be.[[381]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-387) FIFA executive committee member [Theo Zwanziger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theo_Zwanziger "Theo Zwanziger") said that awarding the event to Qatar was a "blatant mistake".[[382]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-388)

[Frank Lowy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lowy "Frank Lowy"), chairman of [Football Federation Australia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Federation_Australia "Football Federation Australia"), said that if the 2022 World Cup were moved to November and thus upset the schedule of the [A-League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-League "A-League"), they would seek compensation from FIFA.[[383]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-389)[Richard Scudamore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Scudamore "Richard Scudamore"), chief executive of the [Premier League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_League "Premier League"), stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.[[384]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-390) In 2015, FIFA confirmed that the final would be played in December.[[385]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-391) Critics condemned the Euro-centrism of these allegations, and questioned why global sporting events must be held within the traditional European summer season.[[386]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-392)

### Bidding corruption allegations, 2014

See also: [Garcia Report](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garcia_Report "Garcia Report")

Some allegations were made over the role of former football official [Mohammed bin Hammam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_bin_Hammam "Mohammed bin Hammam") played in securing the bid.[[387]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-393) A former employee of the Qatar bid team alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5 million by Qatar.[[388]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-394) She retracted her claims, but later said that she was coerced to do so by Qatari bid officials.[[389]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-395)[[390]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-396) In March 2014, it was discovered that former [CONCACAF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CONCACAF "CONCACAF") president [Jack Warner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Warner_(football_executive) "Jack Warner (football executive)") and his family were paid almost $2 million from a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign.[[391]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-397)

_[The Sunday Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Sunday\_Times "The Sunday Times")_ published bribery allegations based on a leak of millions of secret documents.[[392]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-398) Five of FIFA's six primary sponsors, [Sony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony "Sony"), [Adidas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adidas "Adidas"), [Visa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_Inc. "Visa Inc."), [Hyundai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyundai_Motor_Company "Hyundai Motor Company"), and [Coca-Cola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coca-Cola "Coca-Cola"), called upon FIFA to investigate the claims.[[393]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-399)[[394]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-400)[Jim Boyce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Boyce_(football_administrator) "Jim Boyce (football administrator)"), vice-president of FIFA, stated he would support a re-vote to find a new host if the corruption allegations are proven.[[395]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-401)[[396]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-402) FIFA completed a lengthy investigation into these allegations and a report cleared Qatar of any wrongdoing. Despite the claims, the Qataris insisted that the corruption allegations were being driven by envy and mistrust while Blatter said it was fuelled by racism in the British media.[[397]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-403)[[398]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-404)

In the [2015 FIFA corruption case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_FIFA_corruption_case "2015 FIFA corruption case"), Swiss officials, operating under information from the [United States Department of Justice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Justice "United States Department of Justice"), arrested many senior FIFA officials in Zürich and seized physical and electronic records from FIFA's main headquarters. The arrests continued in the United States, where several FIFA officers were arrested, and FIFA buildings were raided. The arrests were made on the information of at least a $150 million corruption and bribery scandal.[[399]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-405) From those arrested, $40 million was forfeited under guilty pleas.[[400]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-Justice_Dept-406) In 2022, the president of the El Salvador soccer association, Reynaldo Vasquez, was sentenced to 16 months in prison in connection to over $350,000 in bribes.[[401]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-407)

Following the corruption case, Phaedra Almajid, the former media officer for the Qatar bid team, claimed that the allegations would result in Qatar not hosting the World Cup.[[402]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-408) In an interview published on the same day, [Domenico Scala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domenico_Scala_(manager) "Domenico Scala (manager)"), the head of FIFA's Audit and Compliance Committee, stated that "should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled."[[403]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-BBC_News-409)[[404]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-Owen_Gibson-410)

In 2014, FIFA appointed Michael Garcia as its independent ethics investigator to look into bribery allegations against Russia and Qatar. Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids.[[405]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-411) At the end of the investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report. The FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge, Hans Joachim Eckert, who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later. The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations, stating that Qatar "pulled Aspire into the orbit of the bid in significant ways" but did not "compromise the integrity" of the overall bid process.[[406]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-BBC-412) Michael Garcia reacted almost immediately, stating that the report is "materially incomplete" and contains "erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions".[[406]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-BBC-412)

In 2017, a German journalist Peter Rossberg claimed to have obtained the report and wrote that it "does not provide proof that the 2018 or 2022 World Cup was bought" and stated that he would publish the full report. This forced FIFA to release the original report. The full report did not provide any evidence of corruption against the host of the 2022 World Cup but stated that bidders tested the rules of conduct to the limit.[[407]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-413)

### Russian participation

On 9 December 2019, the [World Anti-Doping Agency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Anti-Doping_Agency "World Anti-Doping Agency") (WADA) handed Russia a four-year ban from all major sporting events, after [RUSADA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Anti-Doping_Agency "Russian Anti-Doping Agency") was found non-compliant for handing over manipulated lab data to investigators.[[408]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-414) The [Russian national team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_national_football_team "Russia national football team") were still permitted to enter qualification, as the ban only applied to the final tournament to decide the world champions. A team representing Russia, which used the [Russian flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Russia "Flag of Russia") and [anthem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_anthem_of_Russia "National anthem of Russia"), could not participate under the WADA decision whilst the ban was active.[[409]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-415) The decision was appealed to the [Court of Arbitration for Sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Arbitration_for_Sport "Court of Arbitration for Sport"),[[410]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-416) and on 17 December 2020, Russian teams were banned from competing at world championships organised or sanctioned by a WADA signatory until 16 December 2022, the day before the third place play-off.[[411]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-417)

After the [Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine "Russian invasion of Ukraine"), Russia's participation was further thrown into doubt. On 24 February 2022, the three teams in Russia's [qualifying path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_%E2%80%93_UEFA_second_round "2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA second round")—[Czech Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic_national_football_team "Czech Republic national football team"), [Poland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poland_national_football_team "Poland national football team"), and [Sweden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_men%27s_national_football_team "Sweden men's national football team")—announced their unwillingness to play any matches in Russian territory.[[412]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-418) Poland and Sweden extended the boycott on 26 February to any qualifying games, and the Czech Republic made the same decision one day later.[[413]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-419)[[414]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-420)[[415]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-421)

On 27 February 2022, FIFA announced a number of sanctions impacting Russia's participation in international football. Russia was prohibited from hosting international competitions, and the national team was ordered to play all home matches [behind closed doors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behind_closed_doors_(sport) "Behind closed doors (sport)") in neutral countries. Under these sanctions, Russia would not be allowed to compete under the country's name, flag, or national anthem; similarly to the Russian athletes' participation in events such as the Olympics,[[416]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-422) the team would compete under the abbreviation of their national federation, the [Russian Football Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Football_Union "Russian Football Union") ("RFU"), rather than "Russia".[[417]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-423) The next day, FIFA decided to suspend Russia from international competitions "until further notice", including its participation in the 2022 FIFA World Cup.[[418]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-424)

### LGBT and women's rights

Main article: [LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_issues_at_the_2022_FIFA_World_Cup "LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup")

There are no [LGBT rights in Qatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Qatar "LGBT rights in Qatar"), with homosexuality as well as campaigning for [LGBTQ+](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ%2B "LGBTQ+") rights criminalised. As such, when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with the security of fans,[[419]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-425) as well as the homophobic football chants of certain nations, were points of discussion.[[420]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-426) The main controversy came from a last-minute FIFA decision to hand out player punishments to European captains who had months earlier announced their intention to continue wearing rainbow-coloured armbands (which began in 2020) in support of anti-discrimination. Typically, kit violations incur a fine, which the teams had said they would pay; on the day of the first match involving one of the teams, FIFA reportedly told the teams that they would receive a yellow card at a minimum for wearing the armbands.[[421]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-Denmark_ready_to_lead_European_withdrawal_from_FIFA_over_armband_row-427) Qatari officials stated that all people are welcome as long as they follow the public display of affection laws which apply to everyone.[[422]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-428)[[423]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-429)

Security officials at stadiums also confiscated items of rainbow clothing and flags featuring rainbows.[[424]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-Qatar_insists_rainbow_colours_are_allowed_at_World_Cup_after_%E2%80%98localised_incidents%E2%80%99_|_The_Independent-430)[[425]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-CNN_11-28-2022-431) American journalist [Grant Wahl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Wahl "Grant Wahl") was briefly detained for wearing a t-shirt with a rainbow on it.[[426]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-432) Wahl reportedly received death threats for wearing the shirt, later dying at the stadium.[[427]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-433)[[428]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-434) Other journalists with Wahl at the time of his death have reported that he began fitting or experiencing a seizure, and called for help himself. They criticised the Qatar Supreme Committee for not providing [defibrillators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defibrillator "Defibrillator") in the stadium, as they had looked for one to try to help Wahl.[[429]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-435) In response, FIFA said that according to the ambulance service, a defibrillator was made available when paramedics later arrived on scene.[[430]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-436) An autopsy done on Wahl in [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") later revealed that Wahl died from an [aortic aneurysm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aortic_aneurysm "Aortic aneurysm") rupture.[[431]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-437)

Discrimination against women in Qatar was also criticised.[[432]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-FIFI_World_Cup_Qatar_Controversial_Host-438)[[433]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-439)[Women in Qatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Qatar "Women in Qatar") have few freedoms,[[432]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-FIFI_World_Cup_Qatar_Controversial_Host-438)[[434]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-440) as they must obtain permission from their male guardians to marry, study abroad on government scholarships, work in many government jobs, travel abroad, receive certain forms of reproductive health care, and act as the primary guardian of children, even if they are divorced.[[435]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-441)

Qatar attracted particular criticism for an incident where a Mexican employee of the World Cup Organizing Committee was accused of allegedly having [sex outside of marriage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zina "Zina"). The woman had previously reported rape, while the male claimed to have been in a relationship with her, after which the woman was investigated for extramarital sex. Women in Qatar face the possible penalty of [flagellation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagellation "Flagellation") and a seven-year prison sentence if convicted for having sex outside of marriage. The criminal case was eventually dropped months after she was allowed to leave Qatar.[[436]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-442)

### Influence of Iran

[![Image 751](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/59/Iran_national_team_fan_01.jpg/250px-Iran_national_team_fan_01.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Iran_national_team_fan_01.jpg)

An Iranian fan showing a banner with "[Woman, Life, Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman,_Life,_Freedom "Woman, Life, Freedom")" slogan.

In November 2022, there were reports suggesting that the government of [Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran "Iran") were working with Qatari officials to suppress anti-government protests at the 2022 FIFA World Cup,[[437]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-auto7-443) in light of the [Mahsa Amini protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahsa_Amini_protests "Mahsa Amini protests"). Leaked documents and audio clips suggested that Iranian government officials were in correspondence with Qatari authorities in order to handle possible protesters.[[438]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-444)

In November 2022, the Qatari government revoked the visas of journalists from a London-based Iranian news channel, [Iran International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_International "Iran International"), known for being critical of the regime, who were seeking to cover the World Cup.[[439]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-445) On 21 November 2022, during the first group stage match from Group B, between Iran and England, attempts were reportedly made by the stadium's security forces to block Iranian fans who wore clothing or carried items bearing slogans that were deemed unsympathetic to the Islamic government of Iran.[[440]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-446) These included t-shirts and signs with "[Woman, Life, Freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman,_Life,_Freedom "Woman, Life, Freedom")" embedded onto them, Iran's previous flags, or any slogans containing the name of [Mahsa Amini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Mahsa_Amini "Death of Mahsa Amini").[[441]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-447) This crackdown continued throughout all of Iran's matches at the World Cup.[[437]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-auto7-443) In addition to removing fans from stadiums, reports showed that officials tried to suppress any filming or photography of possible protests. In one case, Qatari police detained Danish TV presenter, Rasmus Tantholdt, for filming fans with "Woman, Life, Freedom" slogans, some of whom who had been earlier abused by a group of pro-government supporters.[[442]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-448)

### Treatment of Jewish and Israeli visitors

Qatar had previously promised to provide Jewish tourists with cooked [_kosher_ food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashrut "Kashrut") and public [Jewish prayer services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prayer_in_Judaism "Prayer in Judaism") at the tournament. However, shortly before the World Cup began, both were banned by Qatar, who claimed it could not secure the safety of Jews.[[443]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-449)[[444]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-450) Qatar alleged that they could not "secure" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat. It was estimated that 10,000 [religious Jews from Israel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_Jews "Israeli Jews") and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar.[[445]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-:23-451)

Whilst Jewish organisations complained of being unable to find cooked kosher food,[[445]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-:23-451) the [Israeli government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Israel "Government of Israel") said it was happy with the efforts made by Qatar to meet its requests, including kosher food, direct flights from Israel to Qatar, and temporary diplomatic representation in the country. A kosher kitchen under the supervision of Rabbi [Mendy Chitrik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendy_Chitrik "Mendy Chitrik") was open in time for the first match. Rabbi [Marc Schneier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Schneier "Marc Schneier"), president of [The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foundation_for_Ethnic_Understanding "The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding"), said he had never asked the Qatari government for cooked food, and he had been the only person in communication with the Qataris regarding making the World Cup experience inclusive for Jews.[[446]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-452)

Multiple Israeli reporters at the tournament reported fans from [Arab nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_world "Arab world") waving [Palestinian flags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Palestine "Flag of Palestine") and chanting [anti-Israeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Israel "Criticism of Israel") slogans while harassing them.[[310]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-JPost_2022-315)[[447]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-merged1-453)[[448]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-454) Some Israelis reported that they had been escorted out of restaurants when their nationality was revealed.[[449]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-455) The Israeli government warned its citizens traveling to the tournament to hide their Israeli identity out of safety concerns.[[450]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-456)

### Accommodation

The [Rawdat Al Jahhaniya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rawdat_Al_Jahhaniya "Rawdat Al Jahhaniya") fan village was criticised for its overpriced "night cabins" (£185 per night) made out of shipping containers. Tourists complained that the air conditioners in the cabins did not function well, facilities were falling apart, and the sleeping experience did not match their expectations.[[451]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-457) The BBC reported that the tent accommodation at the Qetaifan Island fan village got criticism for having brown-coloured tap water and no air conditioning other than a standing fan.[[452]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-458)[[453]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-459) The tent village in [Al Khor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Khor "Al Khor") was criticised for having inconvenient transportation, a lack of alcohol, long waits to check in, and no locks on the tents.[[454]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-460)[[455]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-461) The lack of suitable and affordable accommodation raised demand for daily shuttle flights from neighbouring areas, such as Dubai, that had adequate numbers of hotel rooms.[[456]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_FIFA_World_Cup#cite_note-462)
