**1940**

_January 2_. The United States protested British interference with mails. ("It cannot admit the right of the British authorities to interfere with American mails on American or other neutral ships on the high seas nor can it admit the right of the British Govern­ment to censor mail on ships which have involuntarily entered British ports. . . ." _Bulletin,_ Vol. II, No. 28, p. 3.)

_January 14_. The Netherlands canceled army leaves and Belgium mobilized. (Fear German spring offensive. _Times,_ Jan. 15, 1940, p. 1.)

Britain rejected protest of twenty‑one republics of December 23, 1939. (". . . the proposal, involving as it does the abandon­ment by the belligerents of certain legitimate belligerent rights, is not one which, on any basis of International Law can be im­posed upon them by unilateral action, and . . . its adoption re­quires their specific assent._. . . ._ Moreover the acceptance of the zone proposals would have to be on the basis that it should not constitute a precedent for a far‑reaching alteration in the existing laws of maritime neutrality. Up to the present it does not appear that means have been found by which the dis­advantages of the zone proposal could be eliminated. . . ." _Bulletin,_ Vol. II, No. 35, p. 200.)

_January 20_. Winston Churchill, First Lord of British Admiralty, warned European neutrals and asked them to join Allies. ("At present their plight is lamentable and it will become much worse. They bow humbly and in fear to German threats of violence, com­forting themselves meanwhile with the thought that the Allies will win, that Britain and France will strictly observe all the rules and conventions and that breaches of these laws are only to be expected from the German side. Each one hopes that if he feeds the crocodile enough, the crocodile will eat him last. All of them hope that the storm will pass before their turn comes to be de­voured. "_Times,_ Jan. 21, 1940, p. 30.)

_January 23_. France rejected protest of twenty‑one republics. (". . . it is the strict right of France and Great Britain to oppose this in good time by a counter‑attack and . . . they cannot be asked to renounce this right." _Bulletin,_ Vol. II, No. 35, p. 202. Cf. Dec. 23, 1939, Jan. 14, _supra_.)

_January 24_. Prime Minister Chamberlain renewed British pledge to Belgium. (Because of German invasion rumors. _Times,_ Jan. 25, 1940, p. 5. Cf. Nov. 20, 1936, _supra_.)

_February 1_. Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita in statement on foreign policy invited active participation of third powers in the construc­tion of the new order in East Asia. (": . . although there are some who suspect Japan of the intention to eliminate the rights and interests of third powers in China. . . . We are, in fact, anxious to see the development of China's trade with other powers and welcome foreign investments in China as long as they are of a purely economic character. And that I am confident, is also the wish of the new Central Government of China that is about to be established." _Ibid._, Feb. 1, 1940, p. 12.)

_February 6_. The United States appointed a minister to Saudi Arabia.

_March 19_. Prime Minister Chamberlain defended lack of British help to Finland. (". . . except for Field Marshal's [Mannerheim's] intimation in January that he would wish to have 30,000 men in May, no request of any sort for land forces was made to us by the Fins. . . . Germany publicly professed her neutrality; but behind the scenes made every effort to prevent others from saving Finland and from performing the task which she had always declared to be her own. The responsibility for this affair stands squarely and firmly upon the shoulders of Germany and no other country. It was fear of Germany which prevented Norway and Sweden from giving us permission to pass our troops through their countries, the fear of Germany which prevented her from making her appeal to us for help." _Commons,_ Vol. 358, col. 1841-1842.)

_March 20_. Russia opposed suggested Finnish‑Norwegian‑Swedish alliance,. (". . . for this kind of an alliance would be directed against the Soviet Union–as is revealed by the strongly anti­-Soviet speech made on March 14 in the Norwegian Parliament by the Speaker of the Parliament, Mr. Hambro–and would run a together counter to the Peace Treaty concluded by the U. S. S. R. and Finland on March 12, 1940. _Finland_, p. 41.)

_March 30_. Winston Churchill forecast long war. ("The British Empire and the French Republic are now joined together in indissoluble union so that their full purposes maybe accom­plished. . . . But the fact is that many of the smaller States of Europe are terrorized. by Nazi violence and brutality into supply­ing Germany with the material of modern war, and this fact may condemn the whole world to a prolonged ordeal with grievous, unmeasured consequences in many lands." _Ibid._, Mar. 31, 1940, p. 35.)

Wang Ching-wei government proclaimed in Nanking. ("He came out for national salvation through opposition to com­munism and conclusion of peace with. Japan. In the face of

EVENTS LEADING UP TO WORLD WAR II 233

all manners of pressure and persecution by Chungking, he pur­sued the path of his conviction, bringing light to his people lost in darkness. Thus has he won the confidence and the following of his nation. His peace and national salvation movement as well as the preparation for a new central government have made rapid headway since the Sixth Kuomintang National Congress which was held in Shanghai in August of last year." _Japan_, Vol. II, p. 57: "A renascent China has just set out on the road to progress; a new defence is about to commence in East Asia." _Ibid._, p. 61.)

The United States refused to recognize the Wang Ching‑wei regime. "In the light of what has happened in various parts of China since 1931, the setting up of a new regime at Nanking has the appearance of a further step in a program of one country by armed force to impose its will upon a neighboring country and to block off a large area of the world from normal political and economic relationships with the rest of the world. The develop­ments there seems to be following the pattern of other regimes and systems which have been set up in China under the aegis of an outside power and which in their functioning especially favor the interests of that outside, power and deny to nationals of the United States and other third countries enjoyment of long‑established rights of equal and fair treatment which are legally and justly theirs.

"Twelve years ago the Government of the United States recog­nized, as did other governments, the National Government of the Republic of China. . The Government of the United States has ample reason for believing that that Government, with capital now at Chungking, has had and still has the allegiance and support of the great majority of the Chinese people. The Government of the United States of course continues to recognize that Govern­ment as the Government of China." Statement by Secretary of State Hull, _Japan,_ Vol. II, p. 59.

_April 2_. Lithuania notified League of her determination to keep Vilna. (Based on peace treaty of July 12, 1920. "In recovering possession of her capital Lithuania vindicated her ancient rights, which never at any time were transferred to Poland." Times; Apr. 3, 1940, p. 15.)

_April 8_. Britain and France mined Norwegian waters. ("Whatever may be the actual policy which the Norwegian Government, by German threats and pressure, are compelled to follow, the Allied Governments can no longer afford to acquiesce in the present state of affairs, by which Germany obtains from Norway facilities which place the Allies at a dangerous disadvantage.

"They have, therefore, already given notice to the Norwegian Government that they reserve the right to take such measures as they may think necessary to hinder or prevent Germany from obtaining in Norway resources or facilities which for the purpose of war would be to her advantage or to the disadvantage of the Allies." _Ibid._, Apr. 8, 1940, p. 10. Cf. _Norway,_ p. 45. "These violations are carried out solely because the States concerned

"The German Government possesses documentary proof that England and France had jointly decided, if necessary, to carry out their action through the territory of the Northern States against the will of the latter." _Norway_, p. 55. "Germany has thus preserved the Scandinavian countries and peoples from destruction, and will until the end of the war defend true neu­trality in the North.

"I am convinced that this action of the Führer has saved an ancient and respected part of Europe from that certain. ruin and utter destruction to which our English and French enemies are clearly indifferent." _Ibid._, p. 64.)

Prime Minister Chamberlain announced full Allied aid to Nor­way. (". . . in view of the German invasion of their country . . ." _Times,_ Apr. 10, 1940, p. 2. Cf. _Norway,_ pp. 61 f.)

Denmark submitted to Germany under protest. ("In these circumstances, which are so grave to our country, I ask all of you inhabitants of the cities and country to maintain an attitude completely correct and dignified, since every inconsiderate act or word can draw in its wake most serious consequences." _Times,_ Apr. 10, 1940, p. 4.)

_April 10_. Iceland suspended exercise of royal power of King of Denmark. (". . . having regard for the fact that the situation created makes it impossible for His Majesty the King of Iceland to execute the royal power given to him under the constitutional act, . . . having regard for the situation now created, Denmark is not in a position to execute the authority to take charge of the foreign affairs of Iceland granted to it by the provisions of Article VII of the Danish‑Icelandic Union Act, nor can it carry out the fishery inspection within Icelandic territorial waters. . . ." _Ibid._, Apr. 11, 1940, p. 6.)

Cf. _Norway,_ p. 70.)

EVENTS LEADING UP TO WORLD WAR II 235

_April 15_. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita said Japan desired _status quo_ of The Netherlands Indies. ("With the South Seas region, and especially the Dutch East Indies, Japan is economically bound by an intimate relationship of mutuality in ministering to one another's needs. Similarly other countries of East Asia maintain close economic relations with these regions. That is to say, Japan, those countries, and these regions are contributing to the prosperity of East Asia through mutual aid and inter­dependence.

"Should the hostilities in Europe be extended to The Nether­lands and produce repercussions in the Dutch East Indies, it would not only interfere with the maintenance and furtherance of the above‑named relations of economic interdependence and co‑existence and co‑prosperity, but would also give rise to an undesirable situation from the standpoint of peace and stability in East Asia." _Times,_ Apr. 16, 1940, p. 9. Cf. _Bulletin,_ Vol. III, No. 66, p. 248.)

They produce considerable portions of the world's supplies of important essential commodities such as rubber, tin, quinine, copra, et cetera. Many countries, including the United States, depend substantially upon them for some of these com­modities." _Ibid._, p. 411, Cf. _Peace,_ pp. 515 f.)

_April 19_. The Netherlands declared state of siege and reaffirmed neutrality. ("As far as is humanly possible we rely on ourselves, but, in addition, we have promises that our neutrality will be respected as long as we actively maintain it. Of this there can be no doubt. Therefore, we do not wish any arrangements. We shun them. The government rejects all suggestions of assistance, whether offered or actually forced on us. The same applies to our overseas territories." _Times,_ Apr. 20, 1940, p. 1.)

Germany dismissed Norwegian envoy. (Because of Norwegian hostility to Germany. _Times,_ Apr. 20, 1940, p. 1. Cf. _Norway,_ pp. 76 f.)

236 EVENTS LEADING UP TO WORLD WAR II

as by the military operations which have taken place by its decision, has created a state of war between Norway and Ger­many. In order to safeguard public order and public life in the parts of Norwegian territory which are under the protection of German troops, I [Hitler] decree: . . ." _Norway,_ p. 78.)

_April 29_. President Roosevelt appealed to Premier Mussolini to exert Italian influence for a just and stable peace. ("A further exten­sion of the area of hostilities, which would bring into the war still other nations which have been seeking to maintain their neutrality, would necessarily have far‑reaching and unforeseeable consequences, not only in Europe, but also in the Near and the Far East, in Africa, and in the three Americas. No man can today, predict with assurance, should such a further extension take place, what the ultimate result might be–or foretell what nations, however determined they may today be to remain at peace, might yet eventually find it imperative in their own defense to enter the war." _Peace_, p. 519.)

_May 1_. The United States established a provisional consulate in Greenland. ("Since communication between Copenhagen and Greenland has been interrupted, direct consular representation has been deemed advisable by the United States and lay the Greenland authorities." _Bulletin,_ Vol. II, No. 45, p. 473.

_May 2_. Prime Minister Chamberlain reported on British retreat from, northern Norway. (". . . it has always been possible for the Germans, with their usual disregard for life, even of their own people, to send reinforcements to Norway at a much greater rate than would be open to us with the inadequate landing places we have to rely on. . . . We have no intention of allowing Norway to become merely, a sideshow, but neither are we going to be trapped into such dispersal of our forces as would leave us danger­ously weak at a vital center." _Commons,_ Vol. 360, cols. 910, 912. Cf. _Norway,_ pp. 95 ff,)

Premier Mussolini wrote President Roosevelt that the Axis opposed extension of the war. (". . . no peace is possible without the fundamental problems of Italian liberty being settled. . . . Italy, however, has never concerned itself with the relations of the American republics with each other and with the United States (thereby respecting the Monroe Doctrine), and might therefore ask for `reciprocity' with regard to European affairs." _Peace,_ p. 522.)

EVENTS LEADING UP TO WORLD WAR II 237

_May 3_. President Roosevelt revealed he had appealed to Italy May 1 not to enter war. (Trying to prevent extension to new areas. _Times,_ May 4, 1940, p. 1. Cf. Apr. 29, _supra_.)

_May 7_. The Netherlands completed defense preparations. (Called up two marine reserve classes. _Times,_ May 8, 1940, p. 1.)

Prime Minister Chamberlain reported on British retreat from Trondheim, Norway. ("I believe it was right to make the first attempt and equally right to withdraw the troops when it was clear that plan would not succeed . . . it became clear we could only maintain our force in the Trondheim region by such a concentra­tion of men and materials and aircraft as would have drawn off altogether an undue proportion of our total resources, and in these special circumstances we decided that we could carry on the campaign in Norway, elsewhere, with greater vigour and effect." _Ibid_., p. 4. Cf. _Norway,_ pp. 110 f. _Commons,_ Vol. 360, col. 1080.)

_May 8_. Winston Churchill attributed failure in Norway to lack of air parity with Germany. ("If we have decided to speak in this plain manner, it is because of the cataract of unworthy sugges­tions and of actual falsehoods which have been poured out to the public during the last few days." _Commons,_ Vol. 360, cols. 1357‑1358. _Norway,_ p. 112.)

_May 9_. British troops occupied Iceland. ("Since the German seizure of Denmark it has become necessary to reckon with the possibility of a sudden German descent on Iceland.

"It is clear that in the face of an attack on Iceland, even on a very small scale, the Icelandic Government would be unable to prevent their country from fallings completely into German _,_ hands." _Times,_ May 10, 1940, p. 1.)

Germany invaded Belgium, Luxemburg, and The Netherlands.

238 EVENTS LEADING UP TO WORLD WAR II

_May 10_. Chancellor Hitler told the Reichswehr the decisive hour had come. ("For 300 years it was the aim of the English and French rulers to prevent every real consolidation of Europe and, above all, to hold Germany in weakness and impotency.

"For this purpose France alone has declared war on Germany thirty‑one times in 200 years.

"For decades it has been the aim of British world rulers to keep Germany from unity, to deny the Reich every earthly possession which is necessary to the preservation of a nation of 80,000,000 people." _Ibid._, May 11, 1940, p. 4.)

Prime Minister Chamberlain resigned. ("I am not now going to make any comment upon the debate in the House of Commons which took place on Tuesday and Wednesday, but when it was over, I had no doubt in my mind that some new and drastic action must be taken if confidence was to be restored to the House of Commons and the war carried on with the vigor and energy which are essential to victory. What was that action to be? It was clear that at this critical moment in the war what was needed was the formation of a government which would include members of the Labour and Liberal Oppositions and thus present a united front to the enemy. . . .

"The essential unity could be secured under another Prime Minister, though not myself. . . .

"His Majesty has now entrusted to my rt. hon. colleague, Mr. Winston Churchill, the task of forming a new Administration on a national basis . . ." _London Times_, May 11, 1940, p. 3.)

The United States froze Belgian, Dutch, and Luxemburg credit. (_Bulletin,_ Vol. II, No. 46, p. 493.)

Belgium protested violation of neutrality. ("Although Ger­many has not declared war, the German Army has just crossed the frontier of the Kingdom of Belgium and has attacked the Belgian Army with considerable forces. All the facts and all the documents in the possession of the Belgian Government prove that the aggression was premeditated. No complaint was brought to its notice before the act of aggression. Moreover, there was nothing in the relations between the two countries, for the most part good, to suggest that a conflict was likely to arise." _Belgium,_ pp. 100 f.)

_May 11_. Allied troops landed at Curaçao and Aruba. (". . . to prevent possible German attempts at sabotage in the important oil refineries of these islands." _Times,_ May 12, 1940, p. 1. Cf. May 9, _supra_.)

Prime Minister Churchill named new cabinet. (Coalition. _Ibid._, p.1.)

_May 13_. Prime Minister Churchill said British policy was war by land, sea, and air, and victory at all costs. (". . . for without victory there is no survival. Let that be realized. No survival for the British Empire, no survival for all that the British Empire has stood for, no survival for the urge and impulse of the ages, that mankind will move forward toward his goal." _Commons,_ Vol. 360, col. 1504.)

EVENTS LEADING UP TO WORLD WAR II 239

_May 14_. The Netherlands Government fled to Britain. ("When it became certain that we and our Ministers would be unable to con­tinue to exercise freely the authority of the State, we took the harsh but imperative step of transferring our residence abroad for as long as would be necessary with the firm intention of returning to The Netherlands when possible.

"The government now is in England. It wanted to prevent ever being placed in such a position that it would have to capitu­late.. By the steps which we have taken, The Netherlands remains a full member of the community of States and will be in a position to continue cooperation with its allies." _Times,_ May 15, 1940, p. 3.)

President Roosevelt again appealed to Premier Mussolini to stay out of war. (". . . reports reaching me from many sources, to the effect that you may be contemplating early entry into the war, have given me great concern _. . . ._ if this war should extend throughout the world it would pass beyond the control of heads of States, would encompass the destruction of millions of lives and the best of what we call the liberty and culture of civilization. And no man, no matter how omniscient, how powerful, can foretell the result either to himself or his own people." _Peace,_ p. 526. Cf. Apr. 29, _supra_.)

_May 15_. The Netherlands Army capitulated. (On advice of the Allies. _Times,_ May 16, 1940, p. 1.)

_May 16_. President Roosevelt asked new defense appropriations. ("First, to procure the essential equipment of all kinds for a larger and thoroughly rounded‑out Army;

"Second, to replace or modernize all old Army and Navy equipment with the latest type of equipment;

"Third, to increase production facilities for everything needed for the Army and Navy for national defense. We require the ability to turn out quickly infinitely greater supplies;

"Fourth, to speed up to a 24‑hour basis all existing Army and Navy contracts and all new contracts to be awarded. . . .

"Our task is plain. The road we must take is clearly indicated. Our defenses must be invulnerable, our security absolute. But our defense as it was yesterday, or even as it is today, does not provide security against potential developments and dangers of the future.

"Defense cannot be static. Defense must grow and change from day to day. Defense must be dynamic and flexible, an expression of the vital farces of the nation and of its resolute will to meet whatever challenge the future may hold." _Bulletin,_ Vol. II, no. 47, pp. 531 f. Cf. _Peace,_ p. 530.)

Ambassador Kensuke Horinouchi told Secretary of State Hull Japan had no plans nor purpose to attack The Netherlands Indies. (Japan "was entirely satisfied with the situation following the reiteration of the _status quo_ in respect to the Netherlands Indies by each of the four governments interested, and . . . it had no purpose to raise any further controversy in that connection unless perchance the British or French should land troops there to protect them . . ." _Ibid._, p. 534. Cf. Apr. 15, 17, _supra_.)

Cf. Apr. 9, May 9, _supra_.)

Prime Minister Churchill promised victory in the coming battle of Britain. ("I have received from the chiefs of the French Republic, and in particular from its indomitable Prime Minister, M. Reynaud, the most sacred pledges that, whatever happens, they will fight to the end, be it bitter or be it glorious. Nay, if we fight to the end, it can only be glorious," _Times,_ May 20, 1940, p. 4.)

_May 26_. President Roosevelt in third appeal to Premier Mussolini offered his good offices to obtain readjustments for Italy from Britain and France. ("Events have been marching swiftly but I still believe that political long range vision favors the limitation of the war to its present areas. . . . The people of the United States are greatly concerned by the indications of the past few days which would seem to show that there was an increasing possibility of the extension of the European War to the Mediter­ranean area. . . . I would take this action in the belief that I am thereby rendering a constructive service at this critical moment with the hope that the cause of peace might thereby be furthered." _Peace,_ pp. 536 f.)

"An extension of the war into the Mediterranean region will almost unquestionably likewise involve a further extension, of the war area in the Near East and in other regions of the world . . . the further extension of the war as a result of Italian participation would at once result in an increase in the rearmament program of the United States itself and in a redoubling of the efforts of the Government of the United States to facilitate in every practical way the securing within the United States by the, Allied Powers of all the supplies and materiel which they may require." _Peace,_ p. 539.)

"If today we have decided to take the risks and sacrifices of war, it is because the honor, interests, and future firmly impose it, since a great people is truly such if it considers its obligations sacred and does not avoid the supreme trials that determine the course of history.

"We are taking up arms, after having solved the problem of our continental frontiers, to solve our maritime frontiers. We want to break the territorial and military chains that confine us in our sea, because a country of 45,000,000 souls is not truly free if it has not free access to the ocean.

"This gigantic conflict is only a phase of the logical develop­ment of our revolution. It is the conflict of poor, numerous peoples who labor against starvers who ferociously cling to a monopoly of all riches and all gold on earth.

"The Constitution lays it down in its first paragraph that the Kingdom of Norway is a free, independent, indivisible, and

EVENTS LEASING UP TO WORLD WAR II 247

inalienable kingdom It prescribes in its last paragraph that no change may ever be made in the Constitution which conflicts with its spirit. Independence is the greatest and highest prin­ciple in the Constitution and everyone who undertakes anything contrary to this principle infringes the Constitution. The Con­stitution also expressly lays it down that anyone who in any way impedes the Storting's freedom of decision makes himself guilty of treason against the Fatherland, so that even decisions of the Storting made under duress must be regarded as illegal.

"This article, to which the French Government have sub­scribed, says that the French Fleet excepting that part left free for the safeguarding of French interests in the Colonial Empire, shall be collected in ports to be specified and there demobilized and disarmed under German or Italian control. From this text it is clear that the French war vessels under this Armistice, pass into German or Italian control while fully armed." _Commons,_ Vol. 362, cols. 303, 304.)

The Soviet Union never reconciled itself to the forcible wrest­ing of Bessarabia, which the U. S. S. R. Government more than once openly declared for the whole world to hear.

"Now, when the military weakness of the U. S. S. R. has be­come a thing of the past, while the present international situa­tion demands the speediest solution of outstanding issues in­herited from the past in order to lay at last the foundations of a durable peace between countries, the Soviet Union considers it necessary and timely in the interests of the restoration of justice to take up jointly with Rumania the immediate settlement of the question of the restoration of Bessarabia to the Soviet Union.

"The Government of the U. S. S. R. considers that the ques­tion of the restoration of Bessarabia is organically bound with the question of transfer to the Soviet Union of that part of Bukovina of which the population in its overwhelming majority is bound to the Soviet Ukraine by the unity of historic destinies as well as by unity of la age and national composition." _Times,_ June 29, 1940, p. 8.

"We have been accustomed to think of our navy and the seas which surround our country as constituting a line of defense so strong that a powerful army was unnecessary. But today the great shipbuilding industries of Norway and Holland have passed into German hands. The fleet of Italy and her shipbuilding capacity are subject to German disposition.

"A prudent trustee must take into consideration the possibility that in another thirty days Great Britain herself may be conquered and her shipyards pass under German control. Many of the war vessels of France have already come under the control of Germany, and the same thing may occur in regard to the great fleet of Great Britain.

Accordingly, the immediate aim of our foreign policy at present is to establish a great East Asian chain of common prosperity with the Japan‑Manchukuo‑China group as one of the links.

The Italian Government, says the Note, find themselves obliged to remind the Hellenic Government of the provocative attitude adopted towards the Albanian nation, * * *. He adds that Italy can no longer tolerate the continuance of this state of things; that the neutrality of Greece has become more and more of a pure fiction. The Italian Government have therefore decided to demand from the Hellenic Government, as a guarantee of the neutrality of Greece and the security of Italy, the right to occupy with their military forces, for the duration of the present conflict with Great Britain, certain strategic points in Greek territory. The Italian Government demand that the Hellenic Government shall not oppose this occupation nor hinder the free passage of the forces detailed to carry it out.

In handing me the above communication the Italian Minister added verbally that the Italian forces would start advancing into Greek territory at 6 a. m. I replied to the Italian Minister that I regarded the contents of this Note and the form of an ultimatum in which it was put as amounting to a declaration of war on the part of Italy against Greece.

Emphatically we must get these weapons to them in sufficient volume and quickly enough; so that we and our children will be saved the agony and suffering of war which others have had to endure.

"There is no demand for sending an American Expeditionary Force outside our own borders. There is no intention by any member of your Government to send such a force. You can, therefore, nail any talk about sending armies to Europe as deliberate untruth.

"Our national policy is not directed toward war. Its sole purpose is to keep war away from our country and our people.

"We must be the great arsenal of democracy. For us this is an emergency as serious as war itself. We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show, were we at war." _Messages_, pp. 73‑79 ; _Bulletin,_ Vol. IV, No. 8, pp. 3‑8.
