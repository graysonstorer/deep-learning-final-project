**24 Oct 1938 - 29 Aug 1939**

Contributor: [C. Peter Chen](https://web.archive.org/web/20160505010109/https:/ww2db.com/credits.php)

After WW1, the Versailles Treaty made former Prussian city of Danzig a quasi-independent city-state. It was governed by a local parliament while was overseen by a League of Nations appointed high commissioner. Being surrounded by Polish territory, the port facilities were also open for Polish use, but the Polish did not take comfort in mere usage. The Polish wanted Danzig within its boundaries, but the predominantly ethnic German city wished for the status quo. When the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany, many recruitment efforts by the party were active in Danzig. By 1933, 38% of the Danzig parliament was consisted of Nazi Party members, and a similarly significant percentage of the population expressed their wish to become a part of Germany. With pride, some of the parliamentarians wore the Nazi swastika on their arms.

Unlike previous annexations of Austria and Memelland, Adolf Hitler treated Danzig somewhat differently. During the Czechoslovakia annexation, Hitler was ready to use force, but diplomatic victories averted military action. Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop went as far as quoting the Czechoslovakia crisis a failure because he was not able to provide the German military an opportunity to make war. With Danzig, Hitler intended to use it as a catalyst to provoke war with Poland. Karl Burckhardt, the League of Nations high commissioner of Danzig, noted to British Lord Halifax that Hitler told him

 "If the slightest incident happens now, I shall crush the Poles without warning in such a way that no trace of Poland can be found afterwards. I shall strike with the full force of a mechanized army, of which the Poles have no conception." 
Burckhardt thought Hitler was boasting his military might instead of threatening war, perhaps setting up a strong façade in the face of the currently ongoing British-French-Russian talks of an alliance to contain Germany. Halifax agreed and made nothing of it.

Although the end-goal was different, the German propaganda machine deployed similar strategies that had worked for them in the previous annexations. One of them was the spread of propaganda using newspapers. While Jewish-owned businesses were vandalized with yellow stars and swastikas or simply attacked, German newspapers told stories of prejudice against the German people in Danzig. William Manchester gathered a collection of headlines from the period:

 "In Karlsruhe the daily paper carried the headline 'WARSAW THREATENS BOMBARDMENT OF DANZIG - UNBELIEVABLE AGITATION ON THE POLISH ARCHMADNESS!' '_POLEN, GIB ACHT!_' ('POLAND, LOOK OUT!') warned the _Berliner Arbeiterzeitung_; 'ANSWER TO POLAND, THE RUNNER-AMOK (_AMOKLÄUFER_) AGAINST PEACE AND RIGHT IN EUROPE!' On Saturday, August 26, the _Zwölf-Uhr Blatt_ reported: 'THIS PLAYING WITH FIRE GOING TOO FAR - THREE GERMAN PASSENGER PLANES SHOT AT BY POLES - IN CORRIDOR MANY GERMAN FARMHOUSES IN FLAMES!' The banner headline in the _Berliner Arbeiterzeitung_ that day read, 'COMPLETE CHAOS IN POLAND - GERMAN FAMILIES FLEE - POLISH SOLDIERS PUSH TO EDGE OF GERMAN BORDER!' Goebbels saved his masterpiece for the Sunday _Völkischer Beobachter_: 'ALL OF POLAND IN A WAR FEVER! 1.5 MILLION MEN MOBILIZED! UNINTERRUPTED TROOP TRANSPORT TOWARD FRONTIER! CHAOS IN UPPER SILESIA!'" 
Of course, no German newspaper mentioned the German mobilizations on the Polish border.

Within Danzig, Germany built support both politically and militarily. The Nazi Party appointed Albert Forster as the city's _Gauleiter_, who proclaimed Danzig German; "In these happy times", he said, "we will stand together and give thanks to the Führer that he has brought us back into Greater Germany." Forster's proclamation was not without forceful support. Starting in Jun 1939, a force 4,000-strong and loyal to the Nazi party was organized in Danzig. On 25 Jun 1939, 1,000 men of the SS bolstered that force under the guise of a sporting contest; of course, most of them did not leave after the competition was over. By the next month, people knew they had no intentions of leaving as they observed the words _Heimwehr Danzig_, "Home Guard Danzig", on the sleeves of their SS uniforms. By Aug, men were working around the clock to build barracks large enough to house 10,000 soldiers.

Through his diplomats, Hitler demanded several items that he knew would worsen relations with Poland, which included the admittance of Danzig into the German _Reich_, the building a German highway a German railway through the Polish Corridor, and the Polish participation in the Anti-Comintern Pact. Hitler knew he must constantly keep demands a bit above Polish tolerance, but yet reasonable enough to stretch out the negotiations, so that he could keep the issue open while Germany prepared for war. The last set of demands was given by Ribbentrop to British Ambassador to Berlin Neville Henderson on 29 Aug 1939, demanding a plebiscite in the Polish Corridor with voting rules tilted to favor a pro-German outcome. Two days later, the German military crossed the Polish border on a conquest that had been in the plans for months. The world finally realized the negotiations for Danzig was nothing but a catalyst, or perhaps, only a distraction.

Finally, addressing US President Franklin Roosevelt's letter of 14 Apr 1939, in which Roosevelt requested Germany to guarantee the borders of 31 nations, Hitler noted the result of the subsequent survey that revealed most of the nations (Poland excluded) responded they were not at all threatened by Germany.
