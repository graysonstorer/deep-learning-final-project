> SLOVAK NATIONAL UPRISING 1944

# The armed struggle of the Slovaks and national minorities living 

# in Slovakia against Nazism was also a fight for the Slovaks’ own 

# national existence in the face of probable liquidation by the Nazis. 

# The growing national self-consciousness of the Slovaks manifested 

# itself in the Uprising, sparked by their decision to end their vassal 

# dependency on Nazi Germany. 

# They thereby proved both to themselves and to the democratic 

# world at large that they had a distinct national existence. 

# This manifested itself in true patriotism and in a display 

# of solidarity with anti-fascists from other European nations. SLOVAK NATIONAL UPRISING 1944 Division of Czechoslovakia 

Following the annexation of Austria, interests of Nazi 

Germany turned against the last bastion of democracy 

in Central Europe – Czechoslovakia. On September 29, 

1938, Germany, Italy, France and Great Britain ordered 

the Czechoslovak government to cede the Sudetenland 

to Germany in accordance with the Munich Agreement. 

Following the signing of the Vienna Arbitration 

on November 2, 1938, Germany and Italy permitted 

Hungary and Poland to take possession of Czechoslovak 

territory. On March 14, 1939, the Slovak State was declared, 

in effect dividing Czechoslovakia. On March 15, 1939, 

Nazis occupied Bohemia and Moravia and declared 

the founding of the Protectorate. 

On July 21, 1939, the Constitution of the Slovak Republic 

was adopted. It was a corporatist constitution like those 

in fascist Italy and Portugal. Economic and foreign policy 

was subordinated to the interests of Nazi Germany. 

On October 26, 1939, a Catholic priest named Jozef Tiso, 

chairman of Hlinka’s Slovak People’s Party, became 

president and head of state. The leading role of Hlinka’s 

Slovak People’s Party was embodied in law.

In addition to this Slovak political party, there were also 

a couple of ethnic minority parties – Deutsche Partei 

(Franz Karmazin) and Szlovenszkoi Magyar Párt (János 

Esterházy). 

The Slovak Republic fought alongside Nazi Germany 

in the war against Poland on September 1, 1939, against 

the USSR on June 22, 1941 and declared war against 

the USA and Great Britain in December 1941. SLOVAK NATIONAL UPRISING 1944 On completion of negotiations in Salzburg on July 27 and 28, 1940,

Political emigrants found asylum in Paris and, after the 

defeat of France, in London. Former Czechoslovak President 

Edvard Beneš was the leader of the London emigrant 

community. The Slovak Communists were represented in 

the London-based resistance by Vladimír Clementis. The 

Czechoslovak Communists in Moscow, led by Klement 

Gottwald, formed the other centre of resistance abroad. 

Following the German attack on the USSR, the Soviets 

acknowledged the Czechoslovak government-in-exile in 

London and broke off diplomatic relations with the Slovak 

Republic. The British government followed suit. On 

December 12, 1943, E. Beneš signed a Treaty of Friendship, 

Mutual Assistance and Post-War Cooperation with the 

Soviet Union. SLOVAK NATIONAL UPRISING 1944 Political resistance in Slovakia 

Former political party members (mainly Social Democrats, 

Agrarians, Nationalists and National Socialists), members 

of civic resistance groups (Obrana národa, Flóra, Justícia, 

Victoire and Demec), the church, and the illegal Communist 

Party had fought since 1939 against the new conditions in 

Slovakia and against Nazi policy. 

Those representing civil democracy and members of the 

Illegal Fifth Central Committee of the Communist Party of 

Slovakia created an underground Slovak National Council 

in December 1943. The founding agreement and the first 

programme document – the Christmas Agreement, which 

demanded the restoration of the Czechoslovak Republic 

and the equal status of Slovakia within it, were signed by 

J. Ursíny, J. Lettrich and M. Josko on behalf of the civic 

bloc and K. Šmidke, G. Husák and L. Novomeský on 

behalf of the Communists in Bratislava. Social Democrats 

I. Horváth and J. Šoltés and representatives of other civic 

groups (P. Zaťko, J. Styk) made up the rest of the underground 

Slovak National Council in January 1944.

Slovak National Uprising 

The Slovak National Uprising occurred partly as 

a consequence of the decision taken by Josef Tiso, 

President of the Slovak Republic, to concede to the 

German occupation of Slovakia on August 28, 1944 – the 

Uprising began the following day. It was also the result 

of long months of preparation, and the political ambitions 

of the Czechoslovak government-in-exile in Great Britain, 

the Czechoslovak Communists in Moscow, sections 

of the Slovak army becoming an insurgent force, and the 

work of the pro-democracy and Communist resistance. 

The Uprising began as General Staff Lieutenant Colonel 

J. Golian, the military commander of the insurgent Slovak 

army ordered Slovak troops to resist the German troops. 

The order with the code name: “Start the evacuation” 

came into effect at 8 pm that evening.

Slovak National Uprising 

In response to Romania switching sides to join the 

anti-fascist Allied countries (on August 23, 1944), 

developments taking a turn for the worse on the Eastern 

front and increased pressure from the partisans, Nazi 

Germany decided to occupy Slovakia. 

Banská Bystrica became the centre of the anti-Nazi 

uprising. The Slovak National Council and National 

Councils took power. Free Slovak Radio began 

broadcasting in Banská Bystrica. The insurgent army 

of around 60 000 men played a key role in defending 

the insurgent territory. The insurgent army fought 

alongside 18 000 partisans for 61 days against well-

-equipped German troops of over 48 000 soldiers 

with front-line experience. Disarmament of two East 

Slovak Divisions by the Germans before the outbreak 

of the Uprising, was a heavy loss.

The Slovak National Uprising brought radical political, 

economic, and social change to those living in the 

liberated insurgent territory of Slovakia, an area measuring 

20 000 km 2 and containing more than 30 districts and 

approximately 1 700 000 inhabitants. The Slovak National 

Council became the political power in the liberated zone 

and the supreme legislative, government and executive 

body. From September 1, till October 26, 1944, it issued 

40 directives. 

The Slovak National Council maintained executive 

authority in the liberated zone via the Revolutionary 

National Committees. These people’s authorities and 

the administration oversaw life in the towns and villages 

in the liberated zone and organized civilian support for 

the insurgent fighters.

The main armed forces to defend the insurgent territory 

from August 29, 1944 onwards, was the Czechoslovak 

Army in Slovakia (from October 1, the 1 st  Czechoslovak 

Army in Slovakia). Together with the partisans, the 

insurgent army joined the Allied forces in the anti-

Hitler coalition. 

The Council for the Defence of Slovakia, the main 

operational and coordinating body of the Uprising, was 

established on September 12, 1944. Its primary task was 

to coordinate the advance of all the armed units (the 1 st 

Czechoslovak Army in Slovakia, partisans, gendarmerie, 

financial guard and other armed units) and to organize the 

defence of insurgent territories. 

The first phase in defending the insurgent territory lasted 

from August 29 till September 10, 1944. The insurgent 

military forces managed to secure the front despite losing 

large areas of territory. The Carpathian–Dukla operation 

run by the Red Army and the 1 st  Czechoslovak Army 

Corps in the USSR greatly assisted in securing the front.

this phase, the 1 st  Czechoslovak Fighter Regiment in 

the USSR and the 2 nd  Czechoslovak Paratroop Brigade 

in the USSR were incorporated into the 1 st  Czechoslovak 

Army in Slovakia. The Plesnivec and Kosatec units 

of the 2 nd  Tactical group made a successful counter-

attack in the north-eastern and northern sections of the 

insurgent front in the Telgárt–Hranovnica and Malužiná 

–Kráľova Lehota areas. Units of the 6  th  Tactical Group 

took Liptovská Osada–Biely Potok and fought intensely 

in the Ostrô highlands. The enemy had the upper hand 

in the north-western section of the insurgent front, 

pushing the insurgents out of Turiec. The insurgents 

in the western section of the front retreated from 

the Handlová–Prievidza–Kremnica area and the Svätý 

Kríž nad Hronom area. Hungary remained neutral on the 

Uprising, and therefore southern sections of the insurgent 

defences saw no activity.

The German Army began its general offensive against 

the insurgents during the third phase of the defence 

of the insurgent territory, from October 18 till the end 

of October 1944. The German Headquarters gradually 

amassed its military forces numbering approximately 48 

–50 000 experienced and well-armed soldiers. Hungary’s 

unsuccessful attempt to exit the war under Regent 

M. Horthy’s leadership on October 15, 1944, became 

grounds for Germany to launch its general offensive 

against the insurgent forces. Consequently the German 

occupation was able to create a base in Northern Hungary 

to launch an attack on the weakly defended and still 

inactive area south of the insurgent territory.

The 2 nd  Czechoslovak Paratroop Brigade fought hard in the 

Slovak National Uprising. It was engaged in many a battle 

en route from Jefremovo in the USSR to the insurgent 

territory in Slovakia, fighting in the successful Carpathian 

–Dukla Operation along the way. The deployment of the 

2nd  Czechoslovak Paratroop Brigade, due to begin on 

September 25, was delayed till October 19, 1944, owing 

to bad weather. Headquarters of the insurgents embattled 

the 2 nd  Czechoslovak Paratroop Brigade into the most 

vulnerable zones on the front. 

Once the Slovak National Uprising had begun, a Combined 

Squadron was formed at Tri Duby airfield. Although the 

Combined Squadron used rather outdated aeroplanes, 

it supported the insurgent land operations and hampered 

the Luftwaffe air-raids. Combined Squadron members 

helped set up and maintain the Air Bridge of Soviet Long 

Range Aviation at Tri Duby airfield. 

The 1 st  Czechoslovak Fighter Regiment in the USSR was 

the first Czechoslovak unit abroad to fly from the USSR 

to the insurgent territory in Slovakia. It engaged in battle 

on September 17, 1944, operating in the enemy’s rear, first 

of all from Zolná airstrip, and later from Tri Duby airfield 

till October 25, 1944. The Army Corps in the USSR greatly 

assisted in securing the front.

With volunteers arriving at the end of August/beginning 

of September 1944, the number of partisans swelled 

to almost 18 000. On September 7, 1944, the Slovak 

National Council appointed K. Šmidke main commander 

of the partisan units in Slovakia. Two weeks later 

he became Commander of the Headquarters of Partisan 

Units in Slovakia. 

The joint military actions carried out by insurgent soldiers, 

partisans, the gendarmerie and financial guard were 

coordinated by the Council for the Defence of Slovakia 

from September 12, 1944 onwards.

International Participation in the Slovak National Uprising 

In terms of scope, military, national and international 

importance, the Slovak National Uprising was one 

of the greatest armed-political acts of the Slovak nation 

in its modern history. It was part of the wider resistance 

movement in Europe. The Slovak Uprising against Nazism 

was also a fight for the Slovaks’ own national existence. 

The Slovak National Uprising provoked a great 

international reaction and became an important part 

of the European anti-fascist resistance during World 

War II. Thirty-three nations and nationalities from four 

continents were involved.

Allied assistance 

Soviet support for the Slovak National Uprising was 

legally formalised in the Czechoslovak and Soviet 

Agreement on Friendship, Mutual Assistance and Post-War 

Cooperation dated December 12, 1943. The Carpathian 

-Dukla Operation was the most important Soviet act in 

support of the Slovak National Uprising. The operation 

of the 1 st  and 4 th  Ukrainian Front lasted from September 8 

till October 28, 1944. The Soviets also provided extensive 

air support to the Slovak National Uprising. All military 

and sanitary material was supplied via the Air Bridge. 

The Air Bridge was also used to fly in ground personnel 

of the 1 st  Czechoslovak Fighter Regiment, members 

of the 2nd  Czechoslovak Paratroop Brigade and the 

operating Headquarters of the Corps of the Soviet Long 

Range Air Force, commanded by Colonel B. F. Chirskov. 

During operations Manganese/Windproof, the British 

parachuted in a Czechoslovak intelligence and 

communication group near Veľké Uherce in Topoľčany 

district on June 10, 1944. On the night of September 

18, 1944 to September 19, 1944, the crew of a Halifax 

BMk from the 148 th  RAF Squadron dropped containers 

holding radio and sanitary material in the Tri Duby area 

and also flew in a 4-member SOE group.The Amsterdam

Allied assistance 

The US 15 th  Air Force provided military assistance 

during the Slovak National Uprising by transporting 

out US airmen shot down over Slovakia, particularly 

in Banská Bystrica, following the launch of the Uprising. 

In addition to military, communications and sanitary 

material, Western Allies also flew in a group of liaison 

and intelligence officers and OSS petty officers to Tri 

Duby airfield. The US Air Force (fighting on the same 

side as the insurgent armed forces) hit and destroyed 

large quantities of German military material and wagons 

at Vrútky railway station on September 13, 1944. 

The US Airforce bombing of the key Luftwaffe airbase 

at Malacky-Nový Dvor on September 20, 1944 was 

its greatest contribution in support of the Slovaks.

Life at the insurgent territory 

Significant changes occurred in education, culture and 

training in the insurgent territory. The education system 

was nationalized, a Front Theatre was established, Free 

Slovak Radio began broadcasting and a military film 

company provided the News. Many Slovak writers, 

artists and musicians were involved in the Uprising. 

The military and political authorities began publishing 

and delivering periodicals, leaflets and appeals within 

the insurgent territory. The most important of these was 

“Bojovník”, the bulletin of the 1 st  Czechoslovak Army 

in Slovakia. The National Committee of Banská Bystrica 

established an Information Agency.

Hlinka Guard Flying Squads were established under 

Otomar Kubala’s command on September 21, 1944. They 

underwent special training courses in Germany and Slovakia 

to prepare them for close cooperation with Nazi security 

services – SiPO, SD, DP, and FS. The Hlinka Guard had 37 

flying squads and 6 troops in the field, comprising around 

5000 guards on rotation, at the end of January 1945. They 

cooperated closely with the SS units in terrorist, intelligence 

and shock actions against the partisans, insurgent soldiers, 

civilians and racially persecuted. The Hlinka Guard Flying 

Squads also took part in the mass executions of the defenceless 

populations of Nemecká, Kremnička, Kováčová, Zvolen and 

many other places in Slovakia. 

General Timotej Ištók, Supreme Commander of the 

gendarmerie, organized the remaining declassed 

gendarmerie, still faithful to the “Ľudák” regime once 

the Slovak National Uprising had begun, into three Flying 

Squads – in Bratislava, Banská Bystrica (from November 

1944) and Trenčín. These cooperated with the Hlinka 

Guard Flying Squads and SiPo and SD German security 

services. SLOVAK NATIONAL UPRISING 1944 Pro-regime military and repressive units 

The Hlinka Youth also began organizing Flying Squads. 

Volunteers from Hlinka Youth Flying Squads attended 

special training courses. The intelligence and information 

service became their major task. 

Minister of National Defence Š. Haššík focused on building 

up the Home Defence, the Slovak Republic war-time army, 

from September 1944 to April 1945. 

It contained 41 533 men (29 139 in Slovakia and 12 394 

abroad) including the Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment, 

Air Force Regiment, permanent warning service, unarmed 

members of the Technical Corps and Labour Corps of the 

National Defence. 

A paramilitary youth organization called the Slovak Labour 

Service was established on March 12, 1942 in accordance 

with Act No. 36. Young men, who were 18 years of age 

or less and had not yet joined the military, were called 

up to the Slovak Labour Service. Jews and those with 

criminal records were not called up. They joined the service 

for 3 to 6 months on average. The Slovak Labour Service 

became an important Home Defence reserve. In March 

1945, its members numbered around 2 000.

48 000 Nazi soldiers from the Wehrmacht, Waffen SS 

and Volkssturm troops fought in the Slovak National 

Uprising. In spite of the initial self-confidence of the 

Nazi troops, the poorly armed insurgents resisted the 

enemy attack for almost two months (from August 29 

till October 27, 1944). The German general offensive 

began on October 18, 1944.

Following the retreat of the insurgents into the mountains, 

around 20 000 partisans fought in 40 partisan units from 

the end of October 1944 till the end of March 1945. 

They carried out 169 subversive actions and hampered 

German troops on front line access paths and in the rear 

of retreating troops.

Partisan War and Liberation of Slovakia 

When the insurgents still controlled part of Central Slovakia, 

the units of the 1 st  and 4 th  Ukrainian Front together with 

units of the 1 st  Czechoslovak Army Corps crossed the 

Carpathian Mountains in the Dukla Pass region and entered 

Slovakia (East Carpathian Operation). The units formed 

a line running from the river Ondava to Vranov nad Topľou, 

central and southern Slánske hills and the river Hornád south 

of Košice. The south east of Slovakia, ceded to Hungary, 

was liberated at the end of 1944. 

The battle for Slovakia continued in January 1945. The troops 

of the 1 st  Ukrainian Front and the 1 st  Czechoslovak Army 

Corps advanced from the north east, the 4 th  Ukrainian 

Front from the east and the 2 nd  Ukrainian Front along with 

the Romanian army from the south east. Intense fighting 

occurred in the Veľká and Malá Fatra area and in Liptovský 

Mikuláš. The German army was pushed out of Bratislava 

on April 4, 1945, and thus most areas in Slovakia had been 

liberated. The border village of Makov was the last place 

to be liberated by the Red Army on May 3, 1945. The war 

in Slovakia had come to an end.

August 29 is rightfully a public holiday in the Slovak 

Republic. The significance of the Slovak National Uprising 

lies in the fact that the Slovak nation took up arms against 

the occupation of its own historical lands and succeeded 

despite the uncertainty of the outcome. The Uprising was 

spontaneous. It had not even been officially declared when 

the soldiers garrisoned in Žilina rebelled against the enemy. 

Following mobilization, recruits flocked to join the insurgent 

army. The army, the partisans and the civil administration 

were all helped by people living at the insurgent territory. 

Breaking the yoke of cooperation with Nazi Germany was 

an inevitable historical step for the Slovak nation. We must 

be rightfully proud of all those who found the moral strength 

to join in the two-month-long heroic resistance against 

a more experienced and better-armed enemy. The victims of 

the Uprising should be revered and all those who participated 

deserve the respect of the people of the Slovak Republic. SLOVAK NATIONAL UPRISING 1944 Memorial places 

The Museum of the Slovak National Uprising (SNU) in 

Banská Bystrica is a central, specialized, research institution

Some of the toughest battles of the Slovak National 

Uprising took place in Strečno. Newly formed insurgent 

units, soldiers and partisans halted the advance of German 

units early on in the Uprising. It took several days for the 

German units to fight their way to Turiec. The defence of 

Strečno is one of the symbols of the military successes of 

the Uprising. SLOVAK NATIONAL UPRISING 1944 Memorial places 

Kalište National Cultural Landmark was initially a charcoal 

settlement in the Baláže village area. It was the centre of 

the partisan movement – the Partisan Republic. The Smrť

frontline unit were based here. Nazis attacked the village 

and murdered 13 inhabitants on March 18, 1945. They 

also murdered 15 Hungarian soldiers in nearby Moštenica. 

The village was not rebuilt after the war and it is a memorial 

to 102 villages burnt down in Slovakia between 1944 

and 1945. SLOVAK NATIONAL UPRISING 1944 Nations in the Slovak National Uprising SLOVAK NATIONAL UPRISING 1944
