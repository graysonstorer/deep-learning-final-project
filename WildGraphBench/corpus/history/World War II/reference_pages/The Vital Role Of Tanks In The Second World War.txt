COLLECTED BY

Organization: [Archive Team](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam)

![Image 4](http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg) Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at [archiveteam.org](http://www.archiveteam.org/) and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php), providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

**The Archive Team Panic Downloads** are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

Collection: [ArchiveBot: The Archive Team Crowdsourced Crawler](https://archive.org/details/archivebot)

ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites).To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.

There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at [http://www.archivebot.com](http://www.archivebot.com/).

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at [https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot](https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot).

The Vital Role Of _Tanks In The Second World War_
=================================================

Britain had been first to use tanks on a mass scale during the [First World War](https://web.archive.org/web/20220325104344/https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/first-world-war). But by the [Second World War](https://web.archive.org/web/20220325104344/https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/second-world-war), it was German forces that had more fully integrated tanks into their fighting methods. Armoured warfare was to be a vital part of the fighting in the Second World War.  
  
In the early years of the war, Germany held the initiative. German forces used [_Blitzkrieg_ tactics](https://web.archive.org/web/20220325104344/https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/the-german-lightning-war-strategy-of-the-second-world-war) in France in 1940, making full use of the speed and armour of tanks to break through enemy defences. It was clear that German tank tactics had evolved during the inter-war period. By contrast, Britain and the Allies were playing catch-up.  
  
The fighting in the North African desert between 1940 and 1943 was highly dependent on tanks. Britain deployed tank models including Crusaders, Valentines and Matildas, which were all relatively lightly armed and susceptible to mechanical problems. But from 1942, Britain was increasingly able to benefit from large numbers of American-produced tanks, like Grants and Shermans.

The Second World War saw armoured clashes on a scale never seen before or since. Tanks were a significant factor in most of the main fighting theatres, from North Africa to Russia and northern France. They featured in some of the critical battles of the war, such as El Alamein in 1942 and Kursk in 1943.

Some of the largest tank battles took place in the desperate struggle between Germany and Soviet Russia. The Russians had the T-34, a tank that was well armed, versatile and manufactured in huge numbers. It played a key role in helping turn the tide on the Eastern Front in favour of Soviet Russia.  
  
By the later years of the war, the German advantage had lessened. Whilst German forces benefitted from the huge armaments of tanks like the Tiger, the industrial might of the Allies meant they had tanks in larger quantities. Allied tank designs also improved, as did their tactical use of armour.

Second World War

### [_Britain's Struggle To Build Effective Tanks_ During The Second World War](https://web.archive.org/web/20220325104344/https://www.iwm.org.uk/history/britains-struggle-to-build-effective-tanks-during-the-second-world-war)

For much of the Second World War, the British Army was saddled with a succession of tanks that ranged from the bad to the barely adequate. Some were rushed into service too quickly and proved notoriously unreliable. Others spent too long in development, or only achieved a degree of usefulness after numerous modifications. Most lacked the armour to resist enemy anti-tank weapons, and nearly all were under-gunned.

These unusual vehicles played an important role in the D-Day landings, the Battle of Normandy and the campaign in north-west Europe. In early 1943, the 79th Armoured Division under the command of Major-General Sir Percy Hobart was given responsibility for developing equipment and tactics to perform specialised tasks in support of ground troops on and after D-Day.
