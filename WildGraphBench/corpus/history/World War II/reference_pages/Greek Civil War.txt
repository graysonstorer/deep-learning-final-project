**Greek Civil War**, (December 1944–January 1945 and 1946–49), two-stage conflict during which [Greek communists](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Communist-Party-of-Greece) unsuccessfully tried to gain control of [Greece](https://www.britannica.com/place/Greece).

The first stage of the civil [war](https://www.britannica.com/topic/war) began only months before Nazi Germany’s occupation of Greece ended in October 1944. The German occupation had been resisted by two principal Greek guerrilla forces, the communist-controlled [EAM-ELAS](https://www.britannica.com/topic/EAM-ELAS) (Ethnikón Apeleftherotikón Métopon–Ethnikós Laïkós Apeleftherotikós Strátos; “National Liberation Front–National Popular Liberation Army”) and the [EDES](https://www.britannica.com/topic/EDES) (Ellínikos Dímokratikos Ethnikós Strátos; “Greek Democratic National Army”), which occasionally cooperated in action. After eliminating all of its political and guerrilla rivals except the EDES in early 1944, EAM-ELAS set up a provisional government in the Greek mountains that by [implication](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/implication) disowned both the Greek king and his government-in-exile. Upon the German troops’ withdrawal from Greece in October, the communists and royalist Greek guerrillas were brought together under British [auspices](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/auspices) in an uneasy [coalition government](https://www.britannica.com/topic/coalition-government) in [Athens](https://www.britannica.com/place/Athens) (Modern Greek: Athína). But this government disintegrated a few weeks later when the communist members of the coalition refused to disband their guerrilla force. A bitter civil war broke out in Athens on December 3, which the British military forces managed to suppress with great difficulty, after EAM-ELAS had overrun virtually all of Greece except Athens and [Thessaloníki](https://www.britannica.com/place/Thessaloniki).

[![Image 4: Close-up of terracotta Soldiers in trenches, Mausoleum of Emperor Qin Shi Huang, Xi'an, Shaanxi Province, China](https://cdn.britannica.com/28/153528-131-208CEA18/Xian-Terra-cotta-soldiers-tomb-Qin-China-Shaanxi.jpg) Britannica Quiz History: Fact or Fiction?](https://www.britannica.com/quiz/history-fact-or-fiction)
The communists accepted defeat and the disbandment of their forces at a conference in February 1945, and a general election was held in Greece in March 1946. The communists and their followers abstained from the voting, however, and a royalist majority was returned. A [plebiscite](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plebiscite) was then held in September 1946 which restored the Greek king to the throne. During 1946 a full-scale guerrilla war was reopened by the communists, who had gone underground. The commitment of defending Greece became too much for Great Britain, and it was taken on by the U.S. government, with the announcement of the [Truman Doctrine](https://www.britannica.com/event/Truman-Doctrine). Massive military and economic aid from the [United States](https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States) was much needed, for by the end of 1947 the communists had proclaimed a provisional government in the northern mountains.

This second communist rebellion lasted until 1949, when the U.S.-supplied and strengthened Greek army managed to clear the rebel centres from the mountainous Greek interior. On Oct. 16, 1949, the Greek communist broadcasting station announced the end of open hostilities, and many of the remaining communist fighters fled the country into neighbouring [Albania](https://www.britannica.com/place/Albania). It is estimated that more than 50,000 combatants died in the conflict, and more than 500,000 Greeks were temporarily displaced from their homes by the fighting. The internecine strife and fierce brutality that characterized the civil war left a lasting [legacy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legacy) of bitterness between segments of the Greek population.

**George II**, (born July 20, 1890, Tatoi, near [Athens](https://www.britannica.com/place/Athens), Greece—died April 1, 1947, Athens), [king](https://www.britannica.com/topic/king-monarch) of [Greece](https://www.britannica.com/place/Greece) from September 1922 to March 1924 and from October 1935 until his death. His second reign was marked by the ascendancy of the military dictator Ioannis Metaxas.

The eldest son of King [Constantine I](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Constantine-I-king-of-Greece), George was excluded from the succession during [World War I](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-I) for his allegedly pro-German sympathies, but he came to the throne when his father was deposed by General Nikólaos Plastíras in September 1922. Feeling ran high against the royal family, however, and, after a royalist [coup d’état](https://www.britannica.com/topic/coup-detat) had been suppressed in October 1923, George felt compelled to leave Greece on December 19 with his queen, Elizabeth. In March 1924 the Greek [National Assembly](https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Assembly-historical-French-parliament) voted the end of the monarchy and proclaimed Greece a republic. The king remained in exile until the [conservative](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conservative)[Populist Party](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Populist-Party-political-party-Greece), with the support of the army, gained control of the Assembly and declared the restoration of the monarchy in October 1935; a [plebiscite](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plebiscite), which was most probably manipulated by the [prime minister](https://www.britannica.com/topic/prime-minister), General [Geórgios Kondílis](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Georgios-Kondilis), was held in November in an effort to demonstrate that the great majority of the people favoured his return.

In 1936 General [Ioannis Metaxas](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ioannis-Metaxas) seized power after asserting that the nation was on the verge of being taken over by the communists. The king’s support of Metaxas put the throne in a controversial position, particularly after Metaxas banned political parties, dissolved Parliament, suspended [constitutional](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/constitutional) rights, and even decreed the [censorship](https://www.britannica.com/topic/censorship) of Pericles’ great funeral oration to the Athenians as recorded by [Thucydides](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thucydides-Greek-historian). The king was forced into exile after the German invasion of Greece in April 1941, going first to [Crete](https://www.britannica.com/place/Crete) (Modern Greek: Kríti), then to Alexandria, and finally to London. After the war republican [sentiments](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sentiments) again threatened his throne, but he was restored by a plebiscite supervised by the [Allies](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Allied-powers-World-War-II) and returned to Greece in September 1946. Upon his death, he was succeeded by his brother Paul.
