# Japanese Atrocities in the Philippines

**People & Events: Japanese Atrocities in the Philippines** ![Image 1: A 1x5 image, likely be a tacker probe](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bataan/subimages/2_1_2blueline.gif) ![Image 2: Bataan Death March](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bataan/peopleevents/images/e_atrocities_01.jpg) On December 14, 1945, Japanese soldiers forced 150 American [prisoners of war](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/macarthur/sfeature/bataan_prison.html) at a compound on Palawan into an air-raid shelter. Then they doused them with gasoline and threw in a match. **A Survivor's Story** A few of the Americans, a very few, survived. Army PFC Eugene Nielson was one of the survivors. He later described the atrocity to U.S. intelligence officers: The trench smelled very strongly of gas. There was an explosion and flames shot throughout the place. Some of the guys were moaning. I realized this was it -- either I had to break for it or die. Luckily I was in the trench closest to the fence. So I jumped and dove through the barbed wire. I fell over the cliff and somehow grabbed hold of a small tree... There were Japanese soldiers down on the beach. I buried myself in a pile of garbage and coconut husks. I kept working my way under until I got fairly covered up... The Japanese were bayoneting [prisoners on the beach]. They shot or stabbed twelve Americans and then dug a shallow grave in the sand and threw them in. Nielsen hid in the garbage until the Japanese left. He then made a break for it but the Japanese saw him and started firing. He jumped into the sea and was shot several times. Miraculously, he lived and managed to escape -- swimming for nine hours and eventually finding his way through the Philippine jungle to American guerrilla forces. It was [Nielsen's story](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bataan/filmmore/ps_palawan.html) that helped convince the American Command to rescue the [prisoners](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bataan/peopleevents/p_pows.html) at Cabanatuan prison camp. It was also his story that made the prisoners of Cabanatuan particularly terrified. **Homemade Radio** The Cabanatuan POWs had heard all about Palawan. They had assembled a secret radio and, in fact, knew a lot about American movements and successes in the war. The radio was ingenious. It was assembled inside a water canteen. Former POW James Hildebrand recalled how the prisoners tricked the Japanese into helping them build their secret radio: ...[The guys] were fixing Japanese radios and they would take certain parts out and tell the Japanese those parts needed replacing, and it was up to the Japanese to get those parts. Well, the Japanese never asked for those parts back, and if you get enough parts you can make a radio, and that's exactly what they did. They fooled the Japanese. **Living in Fear** The news of Palawan terrified the POWs. Many felt that they were next. They believed that their Japanese captors were plotting their massacre. After all, they had all seen acts of Japanese brutality firsthand. Many had been through the infamous [death march](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/macarthur/sfeature/bataan_capture.html) -- where the Japanese army had marched an estimated 72,000 Americans and Filipinos 65 miles to San Fernando, Pampanga. Hampton Sides, author of _Ghost Soldiers_, estimates that 750 Americans and 5,000 Filipinos died on the march -- victims of starvation, disease, and random executions. (It should be noted that estimates vary widely. A study document put out by the Department of Veteran's Affairs puts the American deaths at 650 and Filipino deaths at 16,500. Forrest Johnson, author of _Hour of Redemption_, puts the U.S. deaths at 2,275 and Filipino deaths between 9,000-14,000.) **Atrocities on the March** On the march, the men witnessed arbitrary executions of their fellow American and Filipino soldiers and of Filipino civilians who had offered food or water to the marchers. Bert Bank remembers: One of the POWs had a ring on and the Japanese guard attempted to get the ring off. He couldn't get it off and he took a machete and cut the man's wrist off and when he did that, of course, the man was bleeding profusely. [I tried to help him] but when I looked back I saw a Japanese guard sticking a bayonet through his stomach. On the second day, a fully pregnant Filipino woman threw some food out... this POW in front of me picked up the food and started eating it; and a Japanese guard came... and decapitated that POW... and then he went and cut the stomach out of the Filipino woman. She was screaming "Kill me, Kill me," and they wouldn't do it. **Cruelty in the Camps** ![Image 3: Zero Ward, POW Camp, Philippines, World War II](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bataan/peopleevents/images/e_atrocities_02.jpg) The POWs also experienced intense cruelty at the hands of their captors in Cabanatuan. All had witnessed hundreds of their compatriots die for lack of food and medicine. All had witnessed torture and summary executions. All had experienced Japanese brutality firsthand. Former POW Richard Beck remembered: It's a very sinking feeling to know that you are going to be abused for a long period of time, and that's exactly what it was, it was a long period of abuse -- starvation, beatings... Some people were shot for no reason at all, so you never knew how to assess the situation, whether you should try to lead a low profile. It was a case of never knowing how to cope. **The Kill-All Order** The Cabanatuan POWs' fear of becoming victims of another large scale massacre were well founded. After the war, it became clear that there existed a [high command order](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bataan/filmmore/ps_order.html) -- issued from the War Ministry in Tokyo -- to kill all remaining POWs. This order, read in part: Whether they are destroyed individually or in groups, and whether it is accomplished by means of mass bombing, poisonous smoke, poisons, drowning, or decapitation, dispose of them as the situation dictates. It is the aim not to allow the escape of a single one, to annihilate them all, and not to leave any traces. **Hell Ships** It also became clear after the war that the Japanese were responsible for horrific abuses of POWs aboard tankers leaving the Philippines and bound for Japan. These tankers became known as hell ships. The Japanese put masses of men in the holds of tankers and gave them little food, light, room or water. The men died at an alarming rate -- of suffocation, thirst, and madness. They also died of allied bombing , since the hell ships were not marked with a white cross, as specified by the [Geneva Conventions](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bataan/peopleevents/e_geneva.html), to indicate POWs were on board. The men who survived these tankers became slave laborers in Japanese mines and factories. **Extensive Barbarism** Throughout the Pacific theater, the Japanese treated POWs and civilians barbarically. Survivors of camps in Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Burma and Laos all reported experiencing tremendous cruelty, torture, disease and starvation. It is an astounding fact that while POWs died at a rate of 1.2% in Germany, they died at a rate of 37% across the Pacific. At the end of the war, [war crime trials](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/macarthur/peopleevents/pandeAMEX101.html) were held in Tokyo and throughout the Pacific to attempt to serve justice to the perpetrators of these atrocities. ![Image 4: A 1x5 image, likely be a tacker probe](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bataan/subimages/2_1_2grey.gif) [previous](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bataan/peopleevents/e_liberation.html) | [return to people & events](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bataan/peopleevents/index.html) | [next](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/bataan/peopleevents/e_disease.html)
