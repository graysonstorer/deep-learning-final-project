This monumental six-volume resource offers engaging entries of major diplomatic, military, and political events driving world conflicts from ancient times to the present.

Now from ABC-CLIO, long regarded as a premier publisher of military history, comes a monumental resource that encapsulates the entire scope of conflict among human societies. Spanning nearly five millennia, from the earliest documented fighting to the present, _A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East_, provides a comprehensive survey of major military events. With coverage that reaches beyond the battles, this work examines the political and diplomatic forces driving world conflicts, revolutions, forced changes of governments, international treaties, and acts of aggression and terrorism.

Written by acclaimed military historian Spencer C. Tucker, these six chronologically organized volumes offer an accessible, richly detailed timeline of military conflict across human history. The concise entries cover all important events on the battlefield and in the corridors of power, with special features highlighting hundreds of key leaders and weapon systems. From specific data on casualties to coverage of evolving weapons technology to insightful analyses of the social impact of war, _A Global Chronology of Conflict_ is an essential resource for students, researchers, history buffs, and general readers alike.

*   Sidebars highlighting hundreds of key individuals in the history of military conflict as well as important developments in weapon systems
*   A comprehensive glossary of military terms to help readers understand the language of warfare and weapons
*   A rich illustration program of images, drawings, and maps
