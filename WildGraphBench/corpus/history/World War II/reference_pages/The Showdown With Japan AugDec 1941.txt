A full history of American aid to China is given in Romanus and Sunderland, _Stilwell's Mission to China,_[Ch. I](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-CBI-Mission/USA-CBI-Mission-1.html). The troop strength of a Chinese division was about that of a U.S. regimental combat team, and its supply requirements were much less. In November 1941 the personnel strength of the thirty divisions was set by the Chinese at 10,000 each.

Grunert went on to point out that the conference, though it had recommended the expansion of ground and air forces in the Philippines, had made the main object of Allied naval operations the defense of Singapore, treating the support of the Philippines as "more or less incidental." He concluded, therefore: "More emphasis on the defense and holding of the Philippines is considered necessary."

According to a tabulation from a special War Department monthly report on aircraft, on 30 April 1941 there were on hand: 12 B-17's; 38 B-17B's; and 59 B-17C's and B-17D's. On order as of 30 April were 512 B-17E's. (Tabulation, Tab J, Item 6, Exec 4.)

Deliveries of the 512 B-17E's were scheduled to be completed by the end of July 1942. Forty-two were to be delivered by 30 November 1941. The rate of deliveries was to rise thereafter, from 35 in December to 75 in June.

[24](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic1/USA-WD-Strategic1-4.html#cn24). A detailed analysis of the need for heavy bombers was made by the AAF in September 1941 in AWPD/1. See (1) Chart 1, Sec I, and (2) Tab 17, Sec II, both in Part III, App II, JB 355, see 707.

[25](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic1/USA-WD-Strategic1-4.html#cn25). Craven and Cate, _AAF I,_[p. 172](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/AAF/I/AAF-I-5.html#page172). Twenty-one B -17D's, flown by members of the 19th Bombardment Croup, had been ferried from Hamilton Field, California, to Hickam Field, Hawaii, on 13 May 1941.

The reinforcement of the Philippines and the mobilization of the main part of the Philippine Army were scheduled to be carried out before the end of the winter 1941-42. (See memo, WPD for DCofS (Gen Moore), 8 Oct 41, sub: Phil, Tab A, Book A, Exec 8 and memo cited note 38.)

Maj. Gen. Lewis H. Brereton, who was called to Washington in October 1941 for instruction prior to his assumption of command of the U.S. Array Air Forces in the Far Fast, was told that the War Department recognized and was prepared to accept the risk of attack during the next few months but was going on the assumption that if hostilities came they would not begin before 1 April 1942. (See Lewis H. Brereton, _The Brereton Diaries_ (New York, William Morrow and Company, 1946), pp. 5-11.)

[29](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic1/USA-WD-Strategic1-4.html#cn29). At the time the Army proposed sending a square division to General MacArthur, it had been planned to use the three ships which the Navy proposed to convert to aircraft carriers, transporting the entire force in two trips across the Pacific. (Memo, G 4 for CofS, 26 Aug 41, sub: Indef Postponement by Navy of Conversion of Tr Transports _Wakefield_ _(Manhattan), Mt. Vernon_ _(Washington)_ and the _West Point (America)_ into Airplane Carriers, G-4/ 29717-67.1 General MacArthur had preciously stated that he would not need a division from the United States. (For an account of General MacArthur's reaction to the Army proposal, see Morton, The Fall of the Philippines, Ch. III, [p. 63](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-PI/USA-P-PI-3.html#page63), MS.)

The Army had preciously succeeded in getting the Navy to postpone the contemplated conversion in May 1941. (2) Ltr, JB to SW, 16 Oct 41, same sub. Both ltrs in JB 320, ser 723.

[31](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic1/USA-WD-Strategic1-4.html#cn31). The issue of the use of the three vessels continued to be debated but, ultimately, they were not converted to aircraft carriers.

[34](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic1/USA-WD-Strategic1-4.html#cn34). There is considerable variation in the calculations of troop strength in the Philippines made in Washington and in the Philippine Department on the eve of Pearl harbor-based on different systems of accounting and time of reporting. The figures cited here are based on WPD sources. (See memo [WPD] for SW, 6 Dec 41, sub: Reinforcement of Phil, Tab 1, Folder Book 1, Exec 4.)

Handy, for file in WPD without action, with the notation: "General MacArthur's proposed lines of action are entirely satisfactory. He states that he will go ahead unless the Chief of Staff decides otherwise. Thus, this paper would have required no answer even if the War had not broken."

Accounts published or soon to be published fully cover the negotiations, intelligence reports, and military orders of the final weeks preceding the attack on Pearl Harbor. Much of the evidence on the American side is contained in the various investigations of the Pearl Harbor disaster.

[55](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic1/USA-WD-Strategic1-4.html#cn55). According to Robert E. Sherwood, the best informed opinion in Washington on the eve of Pearl Harbor was that "further Japanese aggression was imminent and that it would come in the Southwest Pacific, its probably objective bring the Kra Isthmus, which joined the mainland of Thailand and Burma with the Malay Peninsula, six thousand miles from Pearl Harbor." (_Roosevelt and Hopkins,_ p. 424.)

[56](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic1/USA-WD-Strategic1-4.html#cn56). Published sources cover very fully the sequence of events and reports on 7 December. See _Pearl Harbor Hearings and Pearl Harbor Report,_ also memoirs of various public figures, in particular the notes of Harry Hopkins made at the close of the day (_Sherwood, Roosevelt and Hopkins,_ pp. 430-34). Apparently the first news of the attack that reached the War Department was a Navy message stating "This is not drill." It was signed by Admiral Husband E. Kimmel, Commander in Chief, United States Fleet, and delivered to the Office of the Chief of Staff by a Navy enlisted man. The authors arc indebted to Maj. Gen. John R. Deane and Lt. Gen. Leonard T. Gerow for filling a gap in the records with their recollections on this point. (1) Ltr, Gen Deane to Maj Gen Orlando Ward, 29 Mar 51. (2) Ltr, Gen Gerow to Gen Ward, 21 Mar 51. Both in OCMH Files.

The only official paper on presidential approval of Army execution of R AINBOW 5 is a penned note signed by General Marshall which stated, "I read to the President and Mr. Hull our message to MacArthur in Manila and to Commanders of Defense Areas, overseas garrisons, etc. They were approved orally." General Gerow added, "Handed to me by C/S 4:50 PM Dec, 7/41." (Filed with WPD 4544-20)

[58](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic1/USA-WD-Strategic1-4.html#cn58). At the Army staff meetings, held in the mornings of 8 through 12 December, the War Plans Division was represented by its chief, General Gerow, who was usually accompanied by another officer from the division. The Army Air Forces was represented by General Arnold or Brig. Gen . Carl Spaatz, or by both. (OCS Notes on Confs, Decisions by CofS, DCsofS, and Other Info, Dec 41. Cf. min, Confs in OCofS, 8-12, Dec, WDCSA CofS Confs, II).

At the Joint Board meetings held during the afternoon on 8, 9, 10, and 13 December, Generals Bryden and Grow, and either General Spaatz or General Arnold were also in attendance. (See min, JB mtgs.)

For movement of antiaircraft units and equipment in the United States, and of planes, ammunition, and units to Hawaii and Panama, and Marshall's insistence on "follow up," see minutes of meetings cited n. 58., For these arid other early movements of troops and equipment, and staff action in connection therewith, sec, in particular: (1) papers in WPD Msg File 1, WPD 3449, 3807, 4622, 4624, and (2) Hq ASF fibs under CofS, G-1,Mar-Jun 42.

The Far Eastern Air Force, like the U.S. Army as a whole, was in the process of being organized. Figures on planes give some indication-but only an indication - of how far it was from being ready. Of 165 modern B-17's allocated, 35 were in the Philippines, 33 of which were in commission, Of 240 modern pursuit planes allocated, 107 (P-40's) had arrived, of which about 90 were in commission, Larger total figures published on various occasions incorporate numbers of obsolete or obsolescent craft, of little or no value in combat.

[62](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic1/USA-WD-Strategic1-4.html#cn62). Toward the end of November the eight destroyers and one of the two cruisers of the Asiatic Fleet had been withdrawn to the south in two forces, one to Balikpapan on Makassar Strait, and one to Tarakan in the Celebes Sea. The "striking force" that remained in the Philippines--one light cruiser _(Houston)_ and a seaplane tender _(Langley)_--was ordered south to Makassar Strait on 8 December. (See Morison, _Rising Sun,_ pp. 154, 193.)

[63](https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-WD-Strategic1/USA-WD-Strategic1-4.html#cn63). The Navy apparently reached the conclusion very quickly that it was impossible to get reinforcements to the Philippines under existing circumstances. General Gerow so reported at a meeting of the General Council on the morning of 9 December. (1) See conf in Bryden's Off, 9 Dec 41, OCS Binder 29.

Marshall added the pledge to the message drafted by WPD. (Sec draft filed WPD 444-20.) This draft was evidently extracted from the volume prepared by WPD (Folder Book 1, Exec 4 cited n. 64) during the afternoon and evening of 6 December and taken to Marshall on the morning of 7 December to be gone over with The President. The volume included proposed messages to sand to commanders in the field in the event of war with Japan. Marshall added the pledge (and made one other addition) to the proposed message for MacArthur, presumably before receiving news of the attack, since it does not include a reference to the attack. The volume includes a copy of the message as corrected by Marshall.
