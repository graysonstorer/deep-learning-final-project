1.1  Meteorological Assessment 

From  1 January to  31  October 2012, totally 23 tropical cyclones (including tropical  storms, severe 

tropical storms, typhoons, severe typhoons and super typhoons) formed over the western North 

Pacific Ocean a nd the South China Sea (Fig1.1)  and  7 of them  made  their  landfall s on China’s 

coastal areas (Fig1.2). They were severe tropical storm  DOKSURI (1206), typhoon VICENTE (1208), 

severe typhoon SAOLA (1209), typhoon DAMREY (1210), severe typhoon HAIKUI (1211) ，typhoon 

KAI -TAK (1213) and severe typhoon TEMBIN (1214).

(From  1 January to  31  October 2012) 

1.1.1 The Characteristics of tropical cyclones in 2012 

The characteristics  of the tropical cyclones in 2012 are  described  as follows: 

1)  Stronger  landing  TCs than normal 

Until  31  October , 23  TCs formed over the Western North Pacific and the So uth China Sea. The  total 

TC  number is nearly the same as the  average ( 22 .9). Among those, 7 TCs made their landfall over 

Ch ina’s coastal areas. The number of landing TC is  slightly over  historical average (6. 6). Six of seven 

landing TCs made their landfall s in the form of  typhoon or  with  higher intensity.  Among them, Severe 

Typhoon S AOLA  (1209), Severe Typhoon H AIKUI  (1211) an d Severe Typhoon T EMBIN  (1214) made 

their landfall s with maximum surface wind speed  around  42~45m/s. And the average d intensity of all 

landing  TCs is 38.1m/s , stronger than the average  (31.4  m/s ).

2) High frequency of  landing  activities  in  August 

In Aug ust,  5 TCs made their landfall over China’s coastal areas (1209 S AOLA , 1210 D AMREY , 1211 2

HAIKUI , 1213 K AI -TAK  and 1214  TEMBIN ). This number  also  br oke  the histor ical  record in August ,

just as  the same month  in 1994 and 1995 . Particularly  two  tropical cyclo nes S AOLA  and D AMREY 

made their landfall s on 2 Aug ust  2012  within only 10 hours  in between , which  was  the  earliest  in 

record. Few days later,  KAI -TAK  made its landfall in Zhejiang Province.  In one -week period,  3 TCs hit 

China’s coastal areas. 

3)  Extensiv e areas affected by strong rainfall and  winds 

In 2012, the coastal regions hit by  TC landfall s extend  from the  Southeast to the  North east  part of 

China with a large sp read of latitude. The TCs land ing  on  the  Southern China coast have high er 

frequency, whi le those land ing  on  the  Eastern China  coast have strong  intensity. D AMREY  (1210) 

and BOLAVEN (1215)  brought severe rainfall and gale wind s in  the north part of China, while 

normally  only one tropical cyclone in every two years would  impact  that region  in e very two years .

DAMREY (1210)  became the strongest TC land ing  to the north of the Yangtze River since 1949. 

There are 18 provinces /regions  in  China have been affected by strong rainfall related to  TC landfall s. 

Among them, Liaoning province, the northeast  part of Hebei  Province, Zhejiang  Province, Shanghai, 

and  the south part s of Jiangsu and Anhui  Provinces,  and  Guangdong and Guangxi  Provinces have 

witnessed regional heavy rainfall. During the period of S AOLA  (1209) affecting Taiwan Island, 

accumulated rain fall of 1786  mm has been observed in the Taiping Mountain in Yilan, Taiwan , China .

During the period of Severe Typhoon H AIKUI  (1211), strong wind s related to  TC landfall s affected 

coastal areas in Zhejiang Province  in  Aug  7-8. In those areas, gale wind s ab ove 12 -level (Beaufort 

scale) lasted 33hr and 14 -level lasted 24hr. The strong rainfall s and storm wind s lasted for about one 

week by 3 TCs,  which are  SAOLA  (1209), D AMREY  (1210) and H AIKUI  (1211) one after another. 

4) Binary tropical cyclones  (more than  usual )

There were much clearly more “binary typhoon” activities in 2012 than usual, and there were totally 10 individual typhoons that had formed into 5 binary typh oon processes, i.e. SAOLA and DAMREY; TEMBIN and BOLAVEN; JELAWAT and EWINIAR; MALIKSI and GAE MI; PRAPIROO and MARIA. Among them, SAOLA first landed on Hualien, Taiwan, China at 03:15 on August 2, and made its second landfall on Fuding, Fujian province at 06:50 on 3 August. DAMREY landed on Xiangshui County, Jiangsu Province at 21:30 on 2 August. DAMREY’s landing time differed in less than 10 hours from the SAOLA’s second landfall, breaking the record for the shortest interval of consecutive landing by two typhoons on China. TEMBIN first landed on Pingtung, Taiwan Province at 05:00 on 24 August, eventually on the Republic of Korea at 09:30 on 30 August. BOLAVEN first landed on PDRK and then entered Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces in China, bringing high winds and rainstorms to the East China coast, 3 provinces in the Northeast China and the Korean Peninsula. 

5)  Offshore intensification 

Among all TCs which either landed on or affected China in 2012, five typhoons were featured with offshore intensifications, and they were  VICENTE (1208),  DAMREY (1210),  HAIKUI (1211), KAI -TAK 

(1213)  and  SON-TINH (1223) respectively. Specifically,  VICENTE  got intensified when it was 3

approaching the coast of Midwest Guangdong, with its maximum wind near the centre increasing from Force 10 (25 m/s) up to Force 13 (40 m/s) before landing; DAMREY’s extreme wind intensit y at its centre reached 40 m/s after entering the Yellow Sea;  HAIKUI became a strong typhoon 13 hours 

before its landfall, with its  centre  only 270 km from Xiangshan, Zhejiang province, and it reached the 

peak  intensity  with the  maximum  wind of  Force 15 (4 8 m/s) near its  centre  just 4 hours before landing; 

KAI -TAK was only a severe tropical storm before it entered the 24 -hour alerting line,  but  it reached 

the  highest  intensity of 40 m/s (Force 13) in its lifetime, when it was approaching to and landing  on 

the  west  coast of the  Guangdong  Province;  SON-TINH was intensified into a severe typhoon over sea about 100 km away from Sanya City, Hainan Province.

1.1.2  Operational Forecast 

From the perspective of TC track forecasts in the past 5 years, there is a tendency that the errors of the official typhoon track forecasts are decreasing year by year. In 2012, the deviations of 24-, 48-and 72-hour typhoon track forecasts were 93 km, 163 km and 232 km respectively, which were obviously less than the multi-year mean values, especially, the 24-hour forecast error was less than 100 km for the first time.

1.2  Hydrological Assessment (highlighting water -related issues/impact) 

In 2012, in general, the precipitation was evenly distributed nationwide, but the precipitation in the Northern China was evidently more than usual, featuring earlier, more frequent and repeated occurrences of heavy rain with higher intensities in some localities. Compared with normal years, the precipitation increase ranged from 50% to 100% in Midwest Inner Mongolia, Western Gansu, Southern Xinjiang; and it was 20%~40% less than normal in Northwestern Henan, Southern Shanxi, and some areas in the Tibet. According to the statistical analyses by river basins, with only exception of the Huai River basin where the rainfall was 10% less than the normal value, all other river basins witnessed more rainfall than normal or close to it, especially in Zhejiang-Fujian region and Liaohe River basin where the rainfall increased by 20%. The short but high-intensity rainfalls occurred in Gansu, Guizhou, Sichuan, Beijing, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Xinjiang among others, among which the Min County in Gansu recorded the maximum hourly rainfall up to 65.4 mm in the first 10-day period in May, with a probability of reoccurrence beyond 1-in-100 year; and the Hebei Township in the Fangshan District of Beijing measured the daily rainfall of 541 mm on 21 July, approaching to the probability of 1-in-500 years. 

There were frequent floods from small- and medium-sized rivers nationwide, and there were more than 350 rivers with water exceeding their warning levels and eventually causing inundations, 60 rivers being overwhelmed due to super-saturation, and 35 rivers meeting historical record-breaking floods. The main trunk of the Yangtze River had met 4 water-level peaks, with its Zhutuo River segment leading to an extensive record-breaking flood, with Cuntan River segment causing the largest flood since 1981. Totally, 3 water level peaks occurred in the main trunk of the Yellow River, and its upper and lower reaches met the largest flood since 1989. The Beiyun River segment in the Hai River basin witnessed the historical record-breaking flood. The Juma River, a branch of the Daqing River, caused the largest flood since 1963. Flood took place in the Taihu Lake region as its water level was beyond the warning line. 

Overall, water was abundant in the major rivers across the country, and obviously there was more inflow water than usual in the upper reach of the Yellow River, whereas there was apparently less inflow water than usual in the Huai River and Songhua River. According to statistics of accumulated water inflows in 7 major rivers nationwide in comparison with same period in normal years, from January to September, with exceptions of the main trunk of the Huai River where inflow was 60%~70% less than normal, the Songhua River and Liao River where inflows were 10%~40% less than normal value, and Xijiang River where inflow was almost 20% less than normal, the rest 4 major rivers had more water inflows than normal or close to it. Specifically, the inflow of the upper reach of the Yellow River was increased by nearly 60%, those of the middle reach of the Yellow River and Yangtze River by more than 10%, and those of Xiangjiang River in Hunan and Ganjiang River in Jiangxi Province by 10%~30%. 

The water storage in the large reservoirs reached a high level across the country, especially the situation was better than that in last year in the northern area. By 1 October, the total water storage in nationwide 422 reservoirs reached 214.77 billion cubic meters, 16.03 billion cubic meters more than 14 

that in the same period of 2011, increasing by 10%, compared with the same period of many years, it was increased by 35.43 billion cubic meters on average, accounting for 20%. According to the statistics based on 134 large reservoirs in the nine provinces (cities, districts) to the north of the Yellow River, the total amount of water was 49.84 billion cubic meters by 1 October, or 2.25 billion cubic meters more than that in early September, accounting for 10% more; it was increased by 7.33 billion cubic meters compared with that in the same period of 2011, accounting for 20% increase; compared with the same period of many years, it was increased by 7.33 billion cubic meters on average, increasing by 20%. 

1.3  Socio -economic Assessment (highlighting socio -economic and DPP issues/impacts) 

Ty phoons or tropical storms brought abundant precipitation to China, and abated the agricultural 

drought and impact of  warm  weather  on Jiangnan  (areas to the south of the Yangtze River)  and  the 

South China , and favored  water storage in  reservoir s. The violen t gust, heavy rain and associated 

astronomical tides also brought about seve re losses in the coastal areas  in  2012 . About twenty 

provinces have been impacted, because generation locations of typhoons are northern shift  further 

than normal. Comparing  with  the economic losses caused by typhoons with those of the last 10 years, 

the economic losses  from  Jan. to Oct. 2012 were  heavier .

In 2012 typhoon disasters affected 50,445,000 person-times in 18 provinces/autonomous regions /municipalities including Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Hainan and Taiwan, claimed 78 lives, with 24 persons missing and 5,620,000 person-times being relocated, affecting 5,998,200 hectares of croplands, including 696,000 hectares of complete failure, and toppling 125,000 houses in which 246,000 were seriously damaged and 419,000 were moderately damaged, with a total direct economic loss of 113.73 billion RMB Yuan. Jilin, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Liaoning and Shandong among others in the North China, which are rarely affected by typhoons, suffered from serious damages and losses.

As ty phoons S AOLA  (1209)  and D AMREY  (1210)  impacted the coastal area of east China,  then 

typhoon H AIKUI  (1211)  approached. CMA had started the intensive observations of satellite, radar, 

and sounding to track the typhoon closely, the FY -2F meteorological sat ell ite typhoon image was 

made  every  6 minutes,126 times intensive observations from 20 soundin g stations were carried out, 

which are located in  7 provinces /cities. The  NMC  of CMA had carried out intensive forecast consults 

in  collaboration  with  Fujian, Zhejia ng, Jiangsu and Shandong provincial meteorological  service s. The 

NMC /CMA  issued red wa rning for typhoon in succession  twice  a day .

In response to typhoon H AIKUI  (1211) , CMA had initiated the  category  I emergency  response plan  on18 

August 7, which was  the fi rst time  in the past five years, and sent workgroup to Shandong, Zhejiang 

and Shanghai to guide the meteorological service. Although typhoon B OLAVEN  (1215) did  not make 

landfall  on  China, but it still brought severe impact  to the  Northeast China after it l anded  on  PDRK .

CMA had initiated  Category  III emergency response at 18:00  UTC  in  22  August, and Liaoning 

meteorological bureau had initiated  category  I emergency response at 8:00  UTC  in  27  August. 

Liaoning, Jilin and Heilongjiang suffered severe storm floo d disasters, which  brought  15 billion RMB 

Yuan  direct economic losses.

2.1.2  Hydrological Achievements/Results 

In 2012,  the  Bureau of  Hydrology , M WR  focused on the flood control and drought relief work, 

strengthen ed  the construction of hydrological information and forecasting institutions,  strengthened 

the efforts  in hydrological monitoring and forecasting, and  provid ed  better  hydrological services  in 

flood control - and drought  relief -oriented  services;  it  enhance d efforts to  upgrade  its  hydrological 

operational system, to  refine the  hydrological information  processing , and to extend hydrological 

services  and  products;  and it fully  implement ed  the co nstruction of hydrological monitoring system for 

medium - and small -sized  rivers, further  advanced  the monitoring and early warning of  flash  flood s20 

and hydrological monitoring  in  emergency .

1) Closely monitoring the Hydrology development, and making rolling  prediction and 

forecasting to enhance the efforts on flood control and drought hydrological meteorological 

services 

The first  is  to strengthen the hydro -meteorological  work shifts . During the Spring Festival, the 

hydro -meteorological personnel  were  arran ged  on duty every day,  routine work shifts were  arrange d

in March,  and  24 -hour  work shifts were  advance d in mid -May, monthly and ten -day  Hydrological 

Overview Summary  were added , apart from  the  issuing  of  the hydrological  situation reports  and 

forecast s as  well as  SMS  3 times per  day. The second  is  to increase efforts on the preparation of the 

service material s. Up to now, total ly  109 "Hydrological  Situation Report s", 141 "Hydrological 

Bulletin s", 38 " Hydrological  Forecast s” ha ve  been issued , and over 100 c omprehensive analysis 

materials have been submitted. The third is to timely submit the analys is on  significant hydrological 

situations and  forecast s. More than 10 analysis -based  comments o n rain fall and  hydrological trend 

forecast have been reported since  the beginning of  2012 , meanwhile the real -time flood forecast s

were released for more than  500 stations, to provide a scientific basis for the leaders of the Ministry 

of Water Resources  and the National Disaster Prevention Office to make decision. The four th is to 

expand the hydrological service  contents . The information including soil moisture and  water level  of 

medium -sized reservoirs  were  collected in  real  time , to lay a good foundation for drought information 

services. The prediction and forecasting  for  63  main control section s ha ve  been conducted,  which 

were issued  forecast s twice per  day at 9:00 and 21:00 respectively. 

2) Improving the related hydrological meteorological operational systems,  and  provid ing  the 

system platform in order to improve the lev el of hydrological meteorological consultation 

Based on ArcGIS platform developed  in  the  phase -1 project of  the  State Flood Control and Drought 

Relief Command System, a new version of the Regime Consultation System has been developed, 

which has  complet ed  the system function of service platform and information platform . The system 

provide four categories of 14 hydrological products,  featuring  intuitive  displays in both areas and 

specific  point s, automatic generati on, active push , easy to operate and rapid ac cess . The system  has 

been put into operation during the flood control consultation s of  the  National Disaster Prevention 

Office in flood season  of 2012 . The meteorological operational application system has been improved, 

initially completing software devel opment of precipitation forecast products production, to get a trial 

run in the weather forecasting operation; to transform and standardize the rainfall map displaying 

color of numerical prediction product,  and  enable  consistent  forecasting precipitation f igure showing 

consistent, which achieved good results in flood control consultation and publicity. In addition, the 

flash flood warning system , the flood forecasting system  and  the database maintenance 

management system ha ve  been improved,  regimen consulta tion system  has been  test ed , which 

provid e technical support for the hydrological services  in  2012 .

3) Strengthening the management of the information submission to conduct the integration of 

information source of small and medium -sized rivers, flash floo d monitoring and early 21 

warning 

In March, the National Disaster Prevention Office issued "Notice on Assigning the Task  for F lood and 

Drought  Reporting in 2012 ",  which has identified  4500 stations reporting flood s and drought s, 63 

major rivers forecasting s tations and 77 coastal typhoon forecasting stations , which  should  directly 

provide  the central government  with  the  water levels and  rain fall  situation, clearly  specify  the 

reporting  items including  elements and frequency,  and  ensure the successful reportin g of  flood s and 

drought s.

Making use of the nation al  hydrological information exchange system,  the regime situation and 

rainfall  information of small - and medium -sized river s monitoring project s, and project construction of 

flash flood monitoring and warni ng system has been integrated,  which  enable s the exchange of 

information between the Hydrological Services  at  minist erial,  river  ba sin, provincial, prefecture and 

city level s, and  greatly improv es the timeliness of  flood  reporting , and expanding the inform ation 

content. Currently, the number of stations reporting to  ministerial Hydrological Service  has  increased 

from 8500 stations to 39000 stations in 2012, among which 16,000  stations  are  for  flash flood 

projects, 15,000 stations  are for  medium - and small -sized  rivers project s, and  700  stations  of 

medium -sized reservoir s.

2.1.3  Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Achievements/Results 

In 2012, the number of deaths and missing people caused by typhoon disaster was the sixth lowest 

since 2000, being at middle  level compared with the same period in the history.       

> Fig 2.5 Deaths and Missing People Caused by Typhoon Disaster from 2000 to 2012

1) Timely Activated Early -warning Response System to Transfer People in Advance to Avoid 

Risks 

According to the typhoon  trac k and  landing forec asts provided by meteorological  departments, local 22 

civil affairs departments at all levels  can  timely activate early -warning response system and made 

emergency transfer and relocation of 5,620,000 person -times,  which  effecti vely redu ced  casualties. 

At the central level, the China National Committee for Disaster Reduction and the Ministry of Civil 

Affairs activated early -warning response system for seven times and dispatched a number of working 

groups to inspect relief material reserve s and shelters and guide local governments to cope with 

possible impacts of typhoon. 24.3

2) Promot ion of  the Normalization and Standard ization of National Comprehensive Disaster 

Reduction Demonstration Community 

China focused on promoting the normalization and standardization of the construction of national 

comprehensive disaster reduction demonstration communities. China promulgated the  industry 

standard  Standards for the Construction of National Comprehensive Disaster Reduction 

Demonstration Communities , printed and distributed the  Interim Measures for the Administration of 

the Construction of National Comprehensive Disaster Reduction De monstration Communities ,

developed the “Application & Exhibition Management System of National Comprehensive Disaster 

Reduction Demonstration Community”, and standardized the construction of demonstration 

communities. According to the statistics, as of the  end of September, the China National Committee 

for Disaster Reduction and the Ministry of Civil Affairs named 2,843 national comprehensive disaster 

reduction demonstration communities. China constantly improved grass -root capability of disaster 

reduction  in urban and rural areas, raised the awareness of disaster prevention , preparedness  and 

reduction of all people, gradually fostered a social a wareness  of disaster prevention , preparedness 

and gradually scored achievements. 23 

3) Actively Planned Promotional  and Education Activities Based on the Day of Disaster 

Prevention and Reduction 

In 2012,  the Day of Disaster Prevention and Reduction were themed with “Carrying Forward the 

Culture of Disaster Prevention and Reduction and Raising the Awareness of Disaster  Prevention and 

Reduction”. The  China National Committee for Disaster Reduction timely distributed the  Notice 

Concerning Doing a Good Job in Related Work  on  the  Day of Disaster Prevention and Reduction in 

2012  to arrange various works related to the Day of  Disaster Prevention and Reduction nationwide. 

According to incomplete statistics, during the Publicity Week of Disaster Prevention and Reduction 

2012, a total of more than 20 million popular science books and publicity brochures on disaster 

prevention and  reduction were distributed, over 3,000 lectures on disaster prevention and reduction 

were held and over 30,000  exercises  were organized. The activities of the Day of Disaster Prevention 

and Reduction have gradually heightened the awareness of disaster prev ention and reduction, 

steadily promoted the efforts on comprehensive disaster reduction of urban and rural communities, 

effectively facilitated community disaster risk and hidden danger inspection and control and 

constantly raised the awareness of disaster  prevention and reduction among all people. 

2.1.4  Research, Training, and Other Achievements/Results 

In the past year, National Climate  Centre  had promoted several researches to satisfy the need of 

seasonal prediction of typhoon, including climatic relat ionship between the track, intensity, genesis of 

tropical cyclones and large -scale circulations. Furthermore, we also had developed a seasonal 

dynamical downscale ensemble prediction system for Northwestern Pacific Ocean typhoon based on 

a WRF model. 

1) Th e dynamic model of TC climate prediction and the climate prediction of WNP 2012 TC 

season 

The characteristics of the TC activities over the  Western North Pacific (WNP) in 2011 were 

summarized. A dynamic climate model was developed for TC short term climate  prediction. The 

preliminary tests were carried out. The prediction of TC activity over the WNP in 2012 was made in 

the spring. The results were the frequency would be below normal, the frequency of TCs landfall 

China would be around normal. The 2 nd  wester n North Pacific TC climate  assessment  report was 

completed. 

2) The TC disaster estimations in 2012 

The disaster pre -estimation was made for every major TC impacting China  in 2012. For those severe 

impacting TCs, the disaster risk s were also  analy zed .

2.1.5  Regional Cooperation Achievements/Results 

1) Cooperation with Malaysian Meteorological Department 

According to the cooperation agreement between the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) 

and the Malaysian Meteorological Department (MMD), Dr. Wan Mai sarah and Muhamad Sofian from 24 

MMD visited CMA for two -week  visit  from  2 to  15  September, mainly focusing on the numerical 

weather prediction post -processing and products interpretation and application. Taking lectures by 

CMA expert as the main form of this  study and exchange, according to the learning needs of the 

Malaysian experts, the NWP  Centre  has carefully organized the entire learning process, arranging 10 

experts from the field of NWP (including typhoon numerical forecasting), the server weather 

fore casting, MICAPS system, web pages production, weather graphics software, system software, 

and so on to give lectures. 

Fig 2.7  Two Malaysian experts visiting the National NWP  Centre 

2) International Promotion of the 3r d version of MICAPS 

Up to  now , MICAPS has been applied  to  17 countries, and relevant trainings have been provided for 

their technicians. In 2012, MICAPS developers visited Mongolia,  Pakistan  and  Laos  among others for 

technical training and guidance. Meanwhile, training and guidance were also provided for technicians 

from D PRK and Malaysia, etc. At the International Training Course for Weather Forecasters, which 

was held  in Nanjing in September 2012, training and guidance related to MICAPS application were 

provided for the forecasters from various countries. 25 

Fig 2.8  MICAPS developers  train ed  for  technicians  from the  Laos .

2.1.6  Identified Opportunities/Chal lenges for Future Achievements/Results 

The main hazard  cau sed by  tropical cyclones on land  is  gale and rainstorm. The influence s of 

ra instorm  are much severe  than gale.  By  collecting  hazard factors, hazard bearing body,  and 

environment , the  capacity of d isaster prevention and reduction, and disaster information of tropical 

cyclones  will  be built . These data will be used to build assessment model of tropical cyclone disaster 

for the service of disaster assessment of tropical cyclones. We also plan to resea rch the threshold 

conditions of rainstorm and gale to build the risk assessment model of tropical cyclone for the 

pre -disaster assessment service. 

To satisfy the need of seasonal prediction of typho on, Beijing Climate  Centre  will further develop a 

downscal ing  ensemble prediction system for Northwestern Pacific Ocean typhoon based on the 

seasonal ensemble prediction system. 26 

2.2  Progress on Key Result Area 2: Minimized Typhoon -related Social and Economic 

Impacts. 

2.2.1  Meteorological Achievements/Results 

The tropical cyclone frequency prediction issued in the early of April 2012 was as follows: It is 

estimated that the tropical cyclones (the max. wind near the  centre  above  8 grade level) number 

would be from 22 to 24 in 2012 in the western North Pacific  and  the  South China Sea, less than 

normal (26, average between 1981 and 2010), and more than that of 2011(total number 21). The 

number of landing tropical cyclones in China would be  from 7 to 9, more than normal (7).The 

beginning landing date would be earl ier than normal ( 28  June), the ending landing date later than 

normal ( 4 October). 

The number of generated tropical cyclones was 2 3 in the western North Pacific and  the  So uth China 

Sea in 2012, near the same as  normal (22.9) . The number of landing tropical  cyclones was 7, near 

normal. The beginning landing date of tropical cyclone in China was  29  June, later than normal; the 

ending landing date was  17  August, earlier than normal. The further analysis of large -scale 

circulation anomalies showed that, during t he active period of tropical cyclone (July to September), 

sea surface temperatures were below or near normal over northwestern Pacific and above normal 

over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, which were unfavorable to the development of tropical 

cyclone. Tropical cyclone activity was found to be related significantly to the variability of the 

monsoon trough, during July to September 2012, the location of monsoon trough was more westward 

and northward than normal, implied an inactive monsoon trough  over the western North Pacific and 

the South China Sea. Meanwhile, the magnitude of the vertical zonal wind share was 4m/s -6m/s 

larger than normal over the western North Pacific, the larger wind share enhanced the divergence of 

heat and energy, which was a lso not conducive for development of tropical cyclone. Therefore, the 

occurrence number of tropical cyclone was less than normal in 2012. 

When we reviewed the predictions results, we found the following predictors support our prediction: 

 According to the  inter -annual and decadal variation analysis, the number of generated 

tropical cyclones was less than normal in 2012, landing tropical cyclones in more than 

normal. 

 According to the forecast of summer vertical wind shear i ndex (weak) at troposphere and 

vor tices at 850hPa by the numerical dynamic model, the number of generated tropical 

cyclones would be less than normal in 2012. 

 Considering the relationship between the landing tropical cyclone and SLP in previous winter, 

the number of landing tropical cyclo nes would be more than normal in 2012. 

 According to statistical analysis, when the western North Pacific subtropical high is strong in 

summer, landing tropical cyclones would be more than normal. 

2.2.2  Hydrological Achievements/Results 

In the 42nd Sessio n of the Typhoon Committee, the project “Urban Flood Risk Management (UFRM)” 27 

initiated and led by China was identified as a comprehensive cooperation project for the three 

working groups on meteorology, hydrology, and disaster risk prevention and mitigatio n, and planned 

to be completed in the first half of the 2013. Its demonstration cities include Shanghai (China), 

Anseong (Korea) and Yokohama (Japan). In addition, five pilot cities including Bangkok (Thailand), 

Manila (the Philippines), Hanoi (Viet Nam),  Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) and Guangzhou (China) 

actively engaged in the project activities. The expected results of the project include the preparation 

and publication of the Guidelines on Urban Flood Risk Management, provision for the pilot cities of 

techni cal support and operational capacity building in terms of weather and flood forecasts and urban 

flood risk mapping. 

To actively and effectively make smooth progress of the project, and successfully complete the tasks 

undertaken by China on schedule, the Bu reau of Hydrology (BOH) under the Ministry of Water 

Resources (MWR) organized a series of activities under the UFRM project in 2012. 

1)  Drafting Meeting on UFRM Guidelines 

The Drafting Meeting on UFRM Guidelines was jointly held by the Bureau of Hydrology,  Ministry of 

Water Resources and the Typhoon Committee and hosted by WMO Regional Training  Centre 

Nanjing from 13 -14 February 2012 in Nanjing. There were 14 participants from Typhoon Committee 

secretariat, China, Hong Kong (China), Japan, Korea and the Phi lippines. The meeting  mainly 

focus ed on the  first draft of UFRM Guidelines submitted by China, and defined the further points to be 

modified, milestones and timetable for the Guidelines, and the deadline for submission of the report. 

At present, the second  draft of the Guidelines has been completed for discussion at the 7th Typhoon 

Committee Integrated Workshop.          

> Fig 2.9 Meeting site 28
> Fig 2.10 Group photo of participants in the drafting meeting on UFRM guidelines

2)  Urban Flood Risk Management Training  Course 

The MWR Bureau of Hydrology and the Typhoon Committee jointly held the Urban Flood Risk 

Management Training Course in Guangzhou from 24 -26 September 2012, with participants from 

Thailand, the Philippines, Viet Nam, Malaysia and China, representing  five pilot cities of UFRM 

project respectively. The Typhoon Committee secretariat dispatched its hydrological experts for 

technical guidance. The 3 -day  training  focused on the application of the Xin’anjiang model, urban 

flood risk mapping, and QPE/QPF tech niques and products application. 

2.2.3  Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Achievements/Results 

Compared with the same periods since 2000, the number of houses collapsed by typhoon disasters 

is decreased by 20.6% in 2012. 

1) Initiated Emergency Respons e System Many Times to Effectively Carry out Disaster Relief 

Efforts 

To cope with such typhoons as Vicente, Saola, Damrey, Haikui and Kai -tak, the National Committee 

for Disaster Reduction and the Ministry of Civil Affairs successively initiated the Nation al Natural 

Disaster Relief and Emergency Response System for four times, timely sent working groups to 

disaster -affected areas to assist and guide local governments in emergency relief efforts, and activity 

cooperated with the Ministry of Finance to arrang e the distribution of disaster relief funds and 

materials from the central government. According to the statistics  by  the end of September, the 

Ministry of Civil Affairs and the Ministry of Finance arranged central disaster relief funds of 6.125 

billion  RM B in 59 batches, including 700 million  RMB  for typhoon disaster. 

2) Timely Carried out Rapid Risk Evaluation on Typhoon Disaster 

China can determine the coverage (county -level administrative unit) and risk levels of typhoons by 29 

leveraging forecast data o f typhoon track and in accordance with precipitation forecasts, data of 

typhoon losses in history, data of potential geological -disaster -prone areas, etc., and can estimate 

the possible losses to be caused by typhoons by drawing similar tracks in history.  In 2012, China 

carried out seven evaluations on  early -warning  of  typhoon disaster, each of which was  completed 

within 5 -8 hours on average. China has further strengthened its capability of rapid risk evaluation on 

typhoon disaster.  

> Fig 2.11 Assessment o f disaster risks caused by Kai -tak

3)  Further buildup of volunteers for last -mile d isaster  inform ation delivery  and  their t rainin g

In 2012, the Ministry of Civil Affairs has  built up  the team s of volunteers for  disaster informa tion 

delivery,  and various l ocal governments have also actively conducted training s on  volunteers for 

disaster informat ion delivery . According to the statistics  by  the end of  September, China ha s more 

than 630,000  volunteer  disaster messengers and further strengthened the  volunteer  messenger 

teams at provincial, city, county, town and village levels. 

4) Earnestly Implemented the Instructions of the Chinese Leaders to Enhance Organization 

and Leadership of Typhoon Prevention and Preparedness 

In 2012 , the State Flood Control and Drough t Relief Headquarters held 6 video conferences to make 

arrangements according to 9 important instructions  from  the Chinese leaders on typhoon prevention 

and preparedness. The meteorological departments at all levels have established the leading groups 

on m eteorological services chaired by their executives to ensure their presence at the forecasting 

desks, and strengthen interaction between higher and lower level departments and emergency 

consultation to timely initiate emergency response based on weather si tuations. From January to 

September, CMA initiated 10 emergency responses to major meteorological disasters (typhoons, 

rainstorms). When the impact of  TC  Haikui was felt, CMA initiated its first  category -I emergency 30 

response over the past five years, and d ispatched 5 working groups to supervise and guide the 

emergency response services at the grass root meteorological departments. 

5) Strengthened Typhoon Monitoring and Warnings to Improve the Timeliness and Accuracy 

of forecasts and warnings 

In 2012, buildi ng on the modern meteorological operational reform and major projects construction, 

efforts were made to improve meteorological monitoring and forecasting services. The observing 

stations in disaster -prone areas were separated by 5 km, and the data was upl oaded hourly and even 

5 minutes in case of typhoon emergency response; the new generation weather radar transmits data 

and national and regional mosaics in real time every 6 minutes; when the impact of typhoon was 

being felt, CMA initiated upper air and sa tellite intensive observations, FY -2F provided monitoring 

imagery every 6 minutes which effectively improved typhoon location and intensity, and wind and 

precipitation forecasts. In 2012, the errors of 24 -, 48 - and 72 -hour typhoon track forecasts by the 

Ce ntral Meteorological Office (CMO) were 94, 162 and 212 km respectively, decreasing by 18, 19 

and 67 km respectively compared with 2011. When the impacts of such typhoons as Saola, Damrey 

and Haikui were being felt, CMA initiated satellite, radar and radios onde intensive observations, 

including monitoring images from FY -2F every 6 minutes and 126 observations at 20 radiosonde 

stations in 7 provinces (municipalities), to ensure more frequent monitoring of typhoon movement in 

all weather and all aspects, in or der to provide real -time and dynamic typhoon information for various 

sectors and the general public. CMO, together with provincial meteorological departments of Fujian, 

Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Shandong among others, conducted several decades of forecasting 

consultations, and provided 40 messages on the hourly location and intensity of Haikui. CMO also 

accurately forecasted the landfall time, location of the above three typhoons, and wind and rainfall 

influence caused by them, and issued 2 red typhoon warnings , which provided strong support for 

disaster prevention, preparedness and mitigation. 

6) Enhanced meteorological services for decision -making in typhoon prevention and disaster 

relief. 

In  2012 when typhoons affected the country, China Meteorological Admini stration (CMA) submitted 

approxi mately 200 reports for decision  making to CPC Central Committee, State Council, Ministry of 

Civil Affairs, Ministry of Land and Resources, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of  Water  Resources, 

National Tourism Administration,  State Oceanic Administration, etc. About 3000 reports of this kind 

were also submitted to local governments and relevant departments by meteorological services at 

various levels in provinces such as Fujian, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Guangdong, Hainan. When Haikui ,

Saola and Damrey affected China in the same period, China’s meteorological departments sent 2.25 

million person -pieces of warning information to heads of governments and those in charge of 

emergencies. The meteorological departments also participated in  typhoon response 

decision -making by providing suggestions to  CPC  committees and governments at all levels on 

evacuating people as well as relieving and preventing disasters. 

7) Pre -evaluation of typhoon related disasters in 2012 31 

In 2012, National Meteorolo gical  Centre  of CMA had carried out 4 typhoon disaster pre -evaluations 

with the accuracy of 60%. According to the pre -evaluation result for typhoons Saola and Damrey, 

their total economic losses would be 10 billion  RMB  or more and affected people  would be  ten 

million s or more, while the real losses and affected people were 46.1 billion  RMB  and 17.619 million. 

For severe typhoon Haikui, the pre -evaluation  result s showed especially severe typhoon disaster 

impacts with economic losses more than 10 billion  RMB  and affected people more than 10 million, 

while the real losses and affected people were 37.09 billion  RMB  and 14.38 million.  The 

pre -evaluation  results show consistent with the real disasters. 

2.2.4  Research, Training, and Other Achievements/Results 

Usi ng the related meteorological data and historical typhoon  - storm disaster data, and the local 

social economy and human resourc e data, environment data, etc. . Careful analysis on  the risk of 

hazard  -formative factors, hazard -affected body, multiply disaste r environment and typhoon  - storm 

catastrophe comprehensive risk distribution in main affect region of Asian ha ve  been  conducted .

Through the project research,  we  established Asian typhoon  - heavy rains comprehensive disaster 

index, and defined the grade standard of jumbo disasters above disasters level, formed risk 

assessment model about typhoon -storm, made relevant risk zoning maps, and mapped the typhoon -

rainstorm risk zoning series project atlas, published 24 study papers or articles.  We a lso developed  a

new meteorological element interpolation method, and applied to the intellectual property registration 

on the analysis of the typhoon -storm hazard  -formative factors. 

2.2.5  Regional Cooperation Achievements/Results 

Mr.  Xue Jianjun, an expert from Nati onal Meteorological  Centre  of CMA , attended the 7th 

international workshop of Typhoon Committee Working Group on Disaster Risk Reduction  (WGDRR) 

at Seoul, Korea on  30 -31  May 2012. He  presented a report entitled Typhoon disaster risk 

management in China. Th e report describes China typhoon disasters and disaster warning, 

emergency response, pointed out disaster early -warning and defense systems played effective roles 

obviously  in  typhoon pre paredness  in recent years, the personnel deaths reduced significantly . At the 

same time,  Mr.  Xue Jianjun raised some viewpoints such as uncertaint ies and sudden TC changes in 

direction and intensity in  typhoon landing forecast s and associated wind and rainfall prediction s, 

which  should be taken into account in the typhoon d isaster risk management . He also proposed that 

the  risk  mapping  should  consider  such  factors as climate change and economic and social 

development, recommended  that  the  case analysis  should be strengthened for  major typhoon 

disaster -oriented  services, and  share d some  efficient  and effective  experience.

2.3.2  Hydrological Achievements/Results 

Regarding typhoon preparedness in 2012, through enhanced leadership, thoughtful deployments, 

scientific directives and clear -cut responsibil ities,  the  State Flood Control and Drought Relief 

Headquarters  made goo d preparations for possible typhoon - induced floods by replacing people 

under risks to safety and minimizing damages and losses. On condition that preparatory work was 

well done to prevent and reduce typhoon -induced disasters , based on effective and timely  forecasts, 

the  local governments took opportunities to increase water storages from typhoon rainfall for 

reservoirs and bonds in dry areas. 

In 2012, on the basis of flood forecasting schemes for 77 sections of 66 rivers in 8 provinces in 

China’s coastal  regions, the MWR Hydrological Information and Forecasting  Centre  provided 

hydrological forecasts and early warnings for the regions that might be affected by landing typhoons. 

It also enhanced torrential rain forecasts/warnings for small - and medium -sized  reservoirs and 

improved accuracy and quality of the hydrological forecasts. Such information not only minimized 

damages, but also provided effective guidance for coastal provinces in making full use of favorable 

rainfall from typhoons for drought relief an d water storage. For example, during the landing of 

Typhoon Bolaven,  on condition that public  safety  is ensured , the  Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning 

provinces , which had not enough water,  increased  water  storages in  large  and medium -sized 

reservoirs. The  water  of big reservoirs was increased by 181 million cubic meters.

2. 4 Progress on Key Result Area 4: Improved Typhoon -related Disaster Risk 

Management in Various Sectors. 

2.4.1  Meteorological Achievements/Re sults 

Through  project of  the  Ministry of  Science and  Technology , the  stud ies  on  typhoon risk assessment 

techn iques  and application s in  Asia  have achieved  the following research  findings :

China has put forward  a classification  standard  for severe  disaster s including impacts of 

typhoon –induced  storm s. However, the typhoon -storm disasters differ from earthquake s and 

tsunami s, etc. The  TC  disaster frequency is high er , but  its casualties are  less relative to earthquake s

and  tsunami  among others. It is  not suit able  to  directly  establish  disaster categories from  existing 

disaster  research  findings . Therefore,  by using TC -related  casualties and  their d irect economic loss 

as  assessment  factors,  through analyses and plausible data  quantification, the corresponding 

disaster index  was established.  Then, considering different economic development level s in Asia, a 

comprehensive  typhoon  disaster grading  standard  was proposed,  which is more  valuable in 

applications .

China has e stablished  a comprehensive  risk  assessment  mo del  for t yphoon hazard , which  takes into 

account  "three factors" , i.e.  formative factors, hazard -affected bod ies and  multipl e disaster 

environment s. The typhoon -rainstorm hazard -formative factors generally include total precipitation, 

precipitation intensi ty  per  unit time, duration, rainfall coverage, etc. Hazard -affected body mainly 34 

includes three  categories,  i.e.  population (population distribution, population structure and personnel 

quality), wealth (regional economic density, disaster -resistant building s, disaster -resilient agriculture 

and aquaculture),  and  lifeline  systems  (transportation, communication, water  and  power suppl ies  and 

people ’s normal life). Multipl e disaster environment s mainly include terrain conditions, river 

distribution, vegetation co verage, land u se  condition s, geological conditions and soil types. 

The  risk  mapping has been made for  China and other parts of  Asia , taking  into account  typhoon 

hazard formative factors : hazard -affected bod ies  and multipl e disaster environment s, and  the 

co mprehensive risk  mapping is based on  integrated analysis of the above three factors.  The China 

regional risk  mapping  is  found  practical  in applications .

In  thematic  research es , 24 academic papers  have been written or published , and 8  master  degree  or 

gradu ate student s have graduated . Through the project research, the scientific research personnel's 

enthusiasm and creativity in risk management  have been  fully mobilize d, an  innovati ve  team  of 

professional s on  risk assessment  has been basically set up,  and  som e lead ing scientists  in the field 

of  comprehensive  disaster risk research  have played  a solid  role in meeting  the  China 's  target s for 

improving  technical capabilities in  comprehensive risk  avoidance  by  2020 .

2.4.2  Hydrological Achievements/Results 

In aspe ct of typhoon disaster risk management, the Ministry of Water Resources initiated emergency 

response mechanism and took emergency measures based on the changing flood situations to 

ensure people’s safety. 

On the afternoon of  1 August 2012, Bureau of Hydrol ogy, Ministry of Water Resources convened a 

special emergency meeting and initiated the  Category  II  emergency response plan against  typhoon s

Saola  (No.  9) and  Damrey  (No.  10 ). At the time  when  China faced se rious  flood threats as the two 

typhoons  were  appr oaching and likely to land  on the  east ern  and  north ern  coasts,  bringing about 

great potential impacts on  a dozen provinces. At the meeting , it was pointed out that the nation’s flood 

prevention was in a critical period and relevant departments must  recogni ze  the importance, urgency 

and complexity of the work. They were also  charged with specific  responsibilities  to  closely monitor 

typhoons,  associated  rainfall and floods , strengthen the duty system and the consultation mechanism ,

enhance the communication w ith relevant departments , to  provide high -quality forecasts and early 

warnings , ensure the smooth operation of communication s,  network s, video conference system s,

etc. , go all out in making  hydrological observation s and prediction s,  and provide  strong  supp ort to 

typhoon pre paredness  and flood  combat . Immediately after the meeting, Bureau of Hydrology issued 

Urgent Notice on Enhancing Hydrological Observation and Prediction , which required the 

hydrological departments in relevant basins and provinces (autono mous regions, municipalities) to 

release timely and accurate information, strengthen the duty system and secure smooth information 

flow , improve prediction and forecasting for decision -making  for people ’s safety. 

2.4.3  Disaster Prevention and Preparedness  Achievements/Results 

Since  2012, the Ministry of Civil Affairs has further advanced the build up  of  volunteer  team s for 35 

disaster informa tion delivery,  and local governments  at various levels  have also actively conducted 

training on  the last -mile  disaster  messengers . According to the statistics  by  the end of September, 

China had more than 630,000 disaster messengers and further strengthened the  volunteer  disaster 

informa tion delivery  teams at provincial, city, county, town and village levels.

2.6  Progress on Key Result Area 6: Improved Capacity to Generate and Provide 

Accurate, Timely, and understandable Information on Typhoon -related Threats. 

2.6.1  Meteorological Achievements/Results 

1) Improvement  in Marine Observation System 

By  June 2012,  there were 139 marine automatic weather stations (including  those  in island s, ship s

and oil drilling  rigs ), 18 buoy s and 34979 region al  automatic weather stations  across  China. In  the 

flood season,  these instrume nts  showed  good  performance  in  typhoon  observation s.

2) Improvement in Radar Observing System 

Since  2012, 6  additional  CINRAD radars have been set up on mainland China.  They have  further 

increased  China ’s capability  for  monitoring typhoon s along  its  southe ast coasts, among others. Th ey 

have  contributed to the disastrous weather pre paredness  and reduction in many provinces. 

3) Improvement in Satellite Observation System 

 FY -2F geostationary satellite rapid range scanning plays important role in TCs detecti on and 

analysis. 

A new geostationary satellite (FY -2F, the seventh of FY -2 series) was launched from  the  Xichang 

Satellite Launch  Centre  on  13  January 2012. FY -2F has more flexible and high er temporal  resolution 

for specific regions  to be  scann ed.  Using FY -2F  satellite data,  the  targeted TCs and convective 

weather  systems  can be  tracked  and monitor ed continuously . FY -2F  provides  the multi -temporal 

observation s and  in-orbit backup with FY -2D and FY -2E.  Together , they  will  play  an  important role in 

natural disas ter monitoring , prevention  and preparedness .

Bas ed on  the satellite image ry which is used  to determine TC  centre s, FY -2F cloud animations are 

very useful, especially for asymmetrical  TC  structure s (e.g. DOKSURI). Because they have six 

minutes interval and  can  show  more continuous TC structure evolution s. At the same time, a new 

improved calibration method was used in FY -2F infrared channels, which can make the brightness 

temperature and some retrieved products more reliable  for  TC application s. For example,  TBB 

product s reflect  evolution  of  mesoscale  TC internal convection s and it  is a useful tool for  accurate  TC 

intensity analysis by using DVORAK objective methods. 

 Satellite Weather Analysis Platform (SWAP) application in TC  forecasting , and  progress  in 

imp roving  satellite demonstration and support ive  cap ability. 

Since  2012 , Satellite Weather Analysis Platform (SWAP) has already be en  used for TC prediction in 

the National and Provincial Meteorological  Services , including the National Meteorological  Centre ,

Guangdong  Province, Shanghai  Municipality , and  Zhejiang  Province , etc. This platform provide s a37 

useful tool for all forecasters,  and  satellite data c an  be  easily  localiz ed . It w ill  become one of the 

important tools for TC prediction and  relevant  services wo rk. 

 Increased  comprehensive application s of  geostationary and polar  orbiting  satellites  have 

improved application s.

FY -3B polar  orbiting  satellites ha s several advantages in monitoring TC internal thermal structure, 

raining band structure, heavy precipitat ion range and cloud asymmetrical structure, with MWTS 

(Microwave Temperature Sounder), MWHS (Microwave Humidity Sounder) and MWRI (Microwave 

Radiation Imager). While, using FY -2D/E/F geostationary satellite, some products like Quantitative 

Precipitation Es timation and Cloud Classi fication c an  be  derived . In  2012 , taking  their respective 

advantages, new products  were  developed and applied to TC analys es. 

 High temporal resolution mosaic imagery  from  several geostationary satellites  has significant 

positive im pacts  on global TC monitoring. 

Taking  comprehensive us e of  the geostationary satellites of  a number of  countries, including Chinese 

FY -2 series, American GOES series, Europe MSG and Japanese MTSAT, a global imagery c an  be 

obtained  in a 3 -hour  internal. The  high temporal resolution mosaic imagery give forecaster s more 

information  including  global TC genesis, development and evolution.  In past  observation s, only the 

polar  orbiting  satellites or single geostationary satellite were used . S ignificant progress  ha s been 

made  in  application s of  multi ple  satellite s. In 2012, numerous TCs have be en  captured, includ ing 

Atlantic Ocean TCs (PAFAEL, NADINE, LESLIE, MICHAEL, ISAAC, ERNESTO), Eastern Pacific 

TCs (PAUL, MIRIAM, KRISTY, JOHN, HECTOR, FABIO, EMILIA, DANIEL), a nd Indian Ocean TCs 

(GIOVANNA, HILWA). 

4) Improvement of Tele -Communication System 

CMA cast, which is a newly established DVB -S2 standard satellite data broadcast system of CMA, 

has become  its formal operation  since  1 June 2012. The CMA cast is an integrated  satellite 

data -broadcasting system  in  conform ance  to the DVB -S2 standard, substituting for the present 

satellite data -broadcasting systems  (PCVSAT, DVB -S and FENGYUN cast ) which  already  have 2400, 

700 and 200 users  respectively . The CMA cast is the major co mponent of the national meteorological 

data dissemination  system,  continuously broadcasting the real -time observation al  data and products 

crucial for the weather forecast s and related services to more than 2500 users. It is also the most 

effective way to s hare the various meteorological data and products with the public user communities 

in China. At present, the daily broadcast data volume is more than 210 GB, including the territorial 

and international observation data, the CMA T639 NWP products, the satel lite observation products 

of FY2D/E and FY3A/B, EUMETSAT satellite products, etc. 38 Land-based observation data AsiaSat-4 C-band Exchanged data from GEONETCast Americas Exchanged data from EUMETCast

The CMACast system is also a major component of WMO IGDDS and GEONETCast systems. It 

substit utes the Regional GEONETCast Network Centre (GNC) for the FENGYUNCast, which 

was formerly integrated into GEONETCast in 2007 as the contribution of China to GEONETCast. 

The CMACast system, compared to the FENGYUNCast, provides higher bandwidth, many new 

da ta contents, as well as the improved user and data management mechanisms. The CMACast 

system has achieved the requirements so as to provide the full services within the framework of 

GEONETCast, plus the better ones to the users in Asia -Pacific Region.

And, in addition to the National Meteorological Information  Centre  designated as GISC and RTH 

Beijing designated as DCPC at the 16th WMO Congress in 2011, CMA has 4 centres, which are 39 

RCC  Beijing, RSMC Beijing, RSMC -ERR Beijing and the National Meteorology Satellite Centre 

(NMSC) of CMA, were designated as DCPC at the 64th session of WMO Executive Council. 

GISC Beijing become s operation al  as from August  15 , 2011. Apart from continu ous  pro vision of GTS 

data and service  product s, GISC Beijing provides an integrated web portal 

(http://wisportal.cma.gov.cn) , through which information from WMO and other interoperable systems 

can be discovered and accessed. Currently, it maintains over 200,000 metadata records for 

meteorological observations and products, and supports the data discovery and subscription service 

for GTS data, CMA’s NWP products and the satellite data of FY -2D/E, FY -3A/B, etc. And, the 4 

DCPCs will  initiate  operation by the end of  2012. 

5) Development in GRAPES_TYM 

GRAPES -TYM passed the quasi -operational test in July of 2012. It is mainly used to forecast typhoon 

tracks, intensity, wind and rainfall brought about by typhoon in  the w estern North Pacific and  the 

South China Sea. This  model runs twice per day when typhoon develops , with a forecast time  validity 

of 72h. Its  horizontal resolution  is 0.15  degree  and vertical  resolution 31 layers. The track forecast of 

GRAPES -TYM is  a slightly  better than T213 Global Typhoon Track Prediction System , while its 

typhoon intensity and rainfall forecast s are  significantly better than  T213. 

6) Development  in Guangzhou Tropical Cycl one  models 

In 2012, the Guangzhou Tropical Cyclone Model (GZTCM) was running smoothly at the Guangzhou 

Institute of  Tropical and Marine Meteorology  under CMA . A non -hydrostatic semi -Lagrange model 

with  a limited area , GZTCM  has  a horizontal resolution of  0.36  degree , 55 vertical layers ( updated 

from the former version  with  31 layers) and  a time step of 200 seconds. With this model,  5-day 

conventional weather forecasts, 72 -h typhoon track forecasts and 72 -h typhoon intensity (pressure  at 

TC  centre ) and  high  wind  forecasts  are issued . Assessments of real -time forecasts  are  made for 

reference in operational forecast s.

Due to the shortfalls in the former version of the GZTCM, work  has been done  on the processing 

techniques for the oceanic boundary layer, convec tion and underlying surface and related technical 

schemes  have been  upgraded, in an attempt of improving the model performance. 

As shown in related observational and experimental studies, the drag coefficient Cd no longer 

satisfies the Charnok equation und er the condition of strong winds. It is known in the analysis of the 

observations in offshore waters of the coast that Cd reduces significantly when local wind speed is 

larger than 25.2 m/s. The model marine area is divided into a domain of deep water, for  which the 

Large and Pong equation is used and Cd decreases when wind speed is larger than 35 m/s, and a 

domain of shallow water, for which an equation that was determined using the observations was used 

and Cd reduces significantly when wind speed is larg er than 25.2 m/s. The two equations were then 

applied in the GZTCM successfully. Take  the typhoon  Nanmadol  as  example. A comparative 

experiment wa s conducted that started  on  00UTC  26  Oct, 201 1. The results show that  TC track 40 

forecasts have been  improve d, especially  after the initial 24  hours . Besides, as Cd all reduces 

significantly in strong -wind condition and maximum wind speed at 10 m increas es accordingly, the 

model track s are found  more realistic.  

> Fig 2.14 Comparisons of the improved schem e and the original scheme (control):
> a) Track forecast errors; b) Maximum wind speed forecast.

Comparisons the improved convective scheme (NSAS)  with  the original scheme (SAS) have shown 

the following  improvements : (1)  the convection prohibitive energy is  defined as the function of 

cloud -base vertical velocity in the NSAS while being treated as a constant in the SAS ; (2)  the rate of 

entrainment was used as a constant in the SAS but as a value in NSAS that decreases with height 

and changes with relative hum idity of ambient atmosphere at heights above cloud base. For the SAS 

scheme, updraft was being entrained out only at heights above cloud top while downdraft was being 

entrained out only heights below cloud base. For NSAS  (new SAS ) scheme, the entrainment t ook 

place between the cloud base and cloud top at a constant rate of entrainment ; (3) the layer of dry air 

at the cloud base inhibits the triggering mechanism of convection  is  taken into account ; (4)  in NSAS, 

the mass flux at the cloud base  has  to meet the  needs of local CFL criteria ; (5)  in SAS, the cloud -top 

height was randomly chosen at heights in which the buoyancy of the air parcel was zero, but in the 

NSAS, the cloud -top height was where the height where the air parcel was at a zero vertical velocity ;

(6) In NSAS, the effect of vertical wind shear in the convective system on the transportation of 

momentum was taken into consideration ; and  (7)  in NSAS, the entrainment of cloud water and snow 

> b41

is  taken into account. The new scheme showed better results, a s shown in operational comparative 

experiments.

7) Improvement in the using of ensemble models 

In 2012,  Typhoon and Marine W eather Forecast  Centre  of CMA (TMWFC)  has  conducted  some 

research  work  in application  of  ensemble forecasts and  product  development . Based on multi -year 

experience in ensemble forecast applications, through analyses on TC track forecasts  in recent years, 

an ensemble –based  TC track rectifying approach has been developed, which has integrated the 

ensemble TC forecasts with operational TC positioning by the Central Forecasting Office/NMC. The 

TC track forecasts with this approach  show less errors compared with  subjective forecasts. The 

following chart shows the typhoon hindcast errors in 2011, in which the 24 -hour ensemble forecast 

error is within 83 km, better than subjective forecasts made by  experts  and 48 - and 72 -hour forecasts 

also show encouraging perform ances. Therefore, this approach has certain reference values, which 

helps forecasters consider uncertainties in typhoon track forecasts by integrating various conditions, 

so as to make better quality forecasts. 42

2.6.2  Hydrological Achievements/Results 

1)  The hydrological prediction and forecast for the key medium -sized reservoirs and their 

rain storm -resi lience  analysis have been  organized, including  hydrological warning and 

forecasti ng for the reservoirs in  typhoon -affected regions. 

Based on  studying and improving the air -land surface coupling technique  for  flood  forecasts , the 

hydrological  department  proposed the technical theory and methodology in  rain storm resi lient 

capacity of res ervoir s, and  collected  flood -prone  water level s and capacity curve s and forecasting 

schemes  for 19 reservoirs in river basins, provinces,  municipalities  and  autonomous  regions. 

Automatic  rain storm -resistant capacity forecasting and warning function s have b een developed  for 

750 key medium -sized reservoirs  based on China ’s flood forecasting system  platform , and put in 

operation  in  video consultation  on  typhoon pre paredness  in 2012 , provid ing  the scientific basis for 

flood prevention and control  in the  medium - and small -sized reservoirs. 

In  typhoon service  delivery , the Bureau of Hydrology  under the  Ministry of Water Resources h ad 

completed the flood forecast s for  total ly  77 sections of the 66 rivers in 8 typhoon -affected coastal

2) Natural Disaster Information Mobile Newspaper  has been o fficially l aunched 

To improve disaster information services, the Ministry of Civil Aff airs officially issued the “Natural 

Disaster Information Mobile Newspaper” on  10  May 2012. The “Natural Disaster Information Mobile 

Newspaper” timely and visually reports the latest news in the form of MMS about natural disaster 

information and disaster re lief on a daily basis to member units of the China National Committee for 

Disaster Reduction, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the departments (bureaus) of civil affairs of 

various provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the centra l government), 

covering more than 1,000 subscribers. 

3) Improved  comprehensive  disaster  response  capability by  leveraging the  project on  satellite 

constellation for  environment and  disaster  reduction 

In 2012, the National Disaster Reduction  Centre  of the  Ministry of Civil Affairs  has  completed  the trial 

operation and acceptance inspection of 10 subsystems of the project on satellite constellation for 

environment and disaster reduction, including operational management system software, database 

management  platform development service, user service and information distribution subsystem, 

remote sensing data processing subsystem, disaster monitoring and early -warning subsystem, 

emergency response subsystem, disaster information  assessment  subsystem, decision  making 

support subsystem, software assembly, and hardware assembly, and will launch the use of the 

subsystems. By leveraging the project on satellite constellation for environment and disaster 

reduction, the National Committee for Disaster Reduction will i mprove its comprehensive capabilities 

in disaster information acquisition, rapid  assessment , early -warning response, comprehensive 

research and judgment, service launching, etc. for various natural disasters. 

4) Actively  carried out  domestic  exchanges and  cooperation on  disaster  prevention ,

preparedness  and  reduction 45 

In April, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and the China Meteorological Administration jointly launched the 

Disaster Reduction in China , a weekly expert interview program broadcasted  via  China W eather TV 

for the first time, publicizing policies, technologies and knowledge on disaster prevention ,

preparedness  and reduction to the general public. In May, the third National Comprehensive Disaster 

Prevention and Reduction and Sustainable Development  Forum was held by the Expert  Panel  on the 

National Committee for Disaster Reduction and the National Disaster Reduction  Centre  in Beijing, 

further deepening domestic exchanges and discussions on the latest scientific research 

achievements and technologies  in disaster prevention , preparedness  and reduction. In May, the 

Ministry of Civil Affairs and PICC Property and Casualty Company Limited signed the Memorandum 

on Strengthening Strategic Cooperation in Disaster Prevention and Reduction to actively carry out 

cooperation in disaster risk  evaluation,  loss assessment, settlement of  insurance  claims and other 

business  sectors .

2.6.4  Research, Training, and Other Achievements/Results 

1)  Study on determining the extra -tropical transition (ET) onset and completion ti mes of 

tropical cyclones 

Four methods for determining the extratropical transition (ET) onset and completion times of 

Typhoons Mindulle (2004) and Yagi (2006) were compared using four numerically -analyzed datasets. 

The open wave and scalar frontogenesis pa rameter methods failed to smoothly and consistently 

determine the ET completion from the four data sources, because some dependent factors 

associated these two methods highly impact on the results. Although the cyclone phase space 

technique succeeded in de termining the ET onset and completion times, the ET onset and 

completion times of Yagi identified by this method exhibited large distinction across the datasets, 

agreeing with prior studies. The isentropic potential vorticity method was also able to identi fy the ET 

onset times of both Mindulle and Yagi using all the datasets, whereas the determined ET onset time 

of Yagi by such a method strikingly differed from that by the cyclone phase space technique, which 

may create forecast uncertainty. 

2)  Application of  Generalized Convective Vorticity Vector in a Rainfall Process Caused by a 

Landing  Tropical Depression 

A heavy rainfall caused by a  landing  tropical depression (TD) is studied via a numerical control 

experiment. It is found that contours of generalized equ ivalent potential temperature ( 

*) are almost 

vertical with respect to horizontal surfaces near the TD  centre  and more densely distributed than 

those of equivalent potential temperature ( 

e). Because the atmosphere is non -uniformly saturated in 

reality, 

* takes place of  e in the definition of convective vorticity vector (CVV) so that a new vector, 

namely the generalized convective vorticity vector (CVV*), is applied in this study. Since CVV* could 

reflect both the secondary circulation and the variation o f horizontal moist baroclinicity, the vertical 

integration of vertical component of CVV* can reflect the rainfall areas in the TD case better than 

potential vorticity (PV), moist potential vorticity (MPV), generalized moist potential vorticity (Pm), and 

CV V, with high -value area corresponding to heavy -rainfall area. 46 

By carrying out a numerical sensitivity experiment on the effect of Hangzhou Bay, it is found that the 

CVV* becomes weaker than that in the control experiment, resulting in reduced rainfall. Fur ther 

analyses show that the Hangzhou Bay provides good water vapor and surface latent and sensible 

heat fluxes to the TD system. Therefore, the bay is very important to mesoscale cloud clusters’ 

genesis and development around the TD and the associated rain fall. 

Fig 2.19  The rainfall and each physical quantity distributions. 

(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) is for PV, MPV, Pm, CVV, CVV*, and Rh respectively. 47 

3)  An observational study on distribution of precipitation associated with  landing  tropical 

cyclones a ffecting China 

In order to provide an operational reference for tropical cyclone precipitation forecast, this study 

investigates the spatial distributions of precipitation associated with  landing  tropical cyclones (TCs) 

affecting China using Geostationary  Meteorological Satellite 5 (GMS5) -TBB dataset. All named TCs 

formed over the western North Pacific that made direct landfall over China during the period  of 

2001 -2009 are included in th e study. Based on the GMS5 -TBB data, this paper reveals that in 

general  there are four types of distribution of precipitation related to  landing  TCs affecting China. (a) 

the South -West Type in which there is a precipitation maximum to the southwestern quadrant of TC; 

(b) the Symmetrical South Type in which the rainfall is mor e pronounced to the south side of TC in 

the inner core while there is a symmetrical rainfall distribution in the outer band region; (c) the South 

Type, in which the rainfall maxima is more pronounced to the south of TC; and (d) the North Type, in 

which the  rainfall maxima is more pronounced to the north of TC. Analyses of the relationship 

between precipitation distributions and intensity of  landing  TCs show that for intensifying TCs, both 

the maximum and the coverage area of the precipitation in TCs increas e with the increase of TC 

intensity over northern Jiangsu province and southern Taiwan Strait, while decreasing over Beibu 

Gulf and the sea area of  Yangtze River  estuary. For all TCs, the  centre  of the torrential rain in TC 

shifts toward the TC  centre  as t he intensity of TC increases. This finding is consistent with many 

previous studies. The possible influences of storm motion and vertical wind shear on the observed 

precipitation asymmetries  have  also  been  examined. Results show that the environmental vert ical 

wind shear is an important factor contributing to the large down -shear rainfall asymmetry, especially 

when a TC makes landfall on the south ern  and east ern  China ’s coast. These results are also 

consistent with previous observational and numerical studi es. 

4)  Impact of sea spray on tropical cyclone structure and intensity change 

The effects of sea spray on tropical cyclone (TC) structure and intensity variation are evaluated 

through numerical simulations using an advanced sea -spray parameterization from the  National 

Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/Earth System Research Laboratory (NOAA/ESRL), which 

is incorporated in the idealized Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecast 

(WRF -ARW) model. The effect of sea spray on TC boundary -lay er structure is also analyzed. The 

results show that there is a significant increase in TC intensity when its boundary -layer wind includes 

the radial and tangential winds, their structure change, and the total surface wind speed change. 

Diagnosis of the vo rticity budget shows that an increase of convergence in TC boundary layer 

enhances TC voritcity due to the dynamic effect of sea spay. The main kinematic effect of the friction 

velocity reduction by sea spray produces an increment of large -scale convergenc e in the TC 

boundary layer, while the radial and tangential winds significantly increase with an increment of the 

horizontal gradient maximum of the radial wind, resulting in a final increase in the simulated TC 

intensity. The surface enthalpy flux enlarge s TC intensity and reduces storm structure change to 

some degree, which results in a secondary thermodynamic impact on TC intensification. Implications 

of the new interpretation of sea -spray effects on TC intensification are also discussed. 48

5)  Numerical simulation on re -intensification of tropical cyclone remnant re -entering the sea: 

A case study 

When Typhoon Toraji (2001) reached the Bohai Gulf  in 1 -2 August 2001, a heavy rain event occurred 

over Shandong  Province in Chin a along the  Bohai G ulf. The  advanced Weather Research and 

Forecast (WRF -ARW) model was used to explore possible effects of environmental factors, including 

effects of moisture transportation, upper -level trough interaction with potential vorticity anomalie s, 

tropical cyclone (TC) remnant circulation, and TC boundary -layer process on the re -intensification of 

Typhoon Toraji, which re -entered the Bohai Gulf after having made a landfall. The National  Centre s

for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) global final (FN L) analysis provided both the initial and lateral 

boundary conditions for the WRF -ARW model. The model was initialized at 1200 UTC on 31 July and 

integrated until 1200 UTC on 3 August 2001, during which Toraji remnant experienced the 

extratropical transiti on and re -intensification. Five numerical experiments were performed in th e study, 49 

including one control and four sensitivity experiments. In the control experiment, the simulated 

typhoon had a track and intensity change similar to those observed. The resu lts from three sensitivity 

experiments showed that the moisture transfer by a southwesterly lower -level jet, a low vortex to the 

northeast of China, and the presence of Typhoon Toraji all played important roles in simulated heavy 

rainfall over Shandong and  remnant re -intensification over the sea, which are consistent with the 

observation. One of the tests illustrated that the local boundary layer forcing played a secondary role 

in the TC intensity change over the sea. 

6)  The use of shear gradient  vortices  in t ropical cyclone heavy precipitation prediction: a 

high -resolution numerical case study. 

This study introduces a new dynamical quantity, shear gradient vorticity (SGV), which is defined as 

vertical wind shear multiplying the horizontal component of vortici ty gradient, aiming to diagnose 

heavy precipitation induced by some strong convective weather systems. The vorticity gradient 

component can be used to study the collision or merging process between different vortexes or the 

deformation of a vortex with a s harp vorticity gradient. Vertical wind shear, another contributed 

component of SGV, always represents the environmental dynamical factor in meteorology. By the 

combined effect of the two components, overall, SGV can represent the interaction between the 

en vironmental wind shear and the evolution of vortexes with a large vorticity gradient. Other 

traditional vorticity -like dynamical quantities (such as helicity) have the limitation in the diagnosis of 

the convection, since they do not consider the vorticity  gradient. From this perspective, SGV has the 

potential to diagnose some strong convective weather processes, such as Extratropical Transition 

(ET) of tropical cyclones and the evolution of multicell storms. The forecast performance of SGV for 

the numerical  ET case of Typhoon Toraji (0108) has been evaluated. Compared with helicity, SGV 

has showed a greater advantage to forecast the distribution of heavy precipitation more accurately, 

especially in the frontal zone. 

7)  Development of a coupled atmosphere -sea  wave model 

A coupled atmosphere -sea  wave  model system has been developed  to evaluate the impact of sea 

surface roughness, sea spray and SST cooling on the changes in intensity and structure of tropical 

cyclone. The coupled model consists of mesoscale atm ospheric model Global and Regional 

Assimilation and Prediction System (GRAPES), Estuarine Coastal Ocean Model with sediment 

transport (ECOMSED) and WAVEWATCH III  (WW3). The coupling among model components is 

implemented by using Ocean Atmosphere Sea Ice So il (OASIS) coupling software. The results show 

the effect of waves in increasing the sea surface roughness under moderate winds conditions and 

enhancing the heat flux between air and sea. Overall, the wave tends to increase the intensity of 

tropical cyclon e. However, the air -sea interaction induced by the ocean model (SST cooling) 

weakens the intensity of tropical cyclone compared to the result of separate atmospheric model 

experiment. 

8)  New method for Typhoon targeted observation 

For typhoon occurred in t he low latitude, it is more nonlinear compared with those middle latitude 50 

systems. So the conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation (CNOP) is one of the most effective 

approaches for the determination of typhoon sensitive area. How to choose the cost func tion when 

CNOP is applied to typhoon intensity and track forecast is investigated. The impacts of CNOP 

targeted observation on typhoon forecast, as well as the sensitivity of different variables and 

variables on different layers in the sensitive area are i nvestigated. In addition, the results of observing 

simulation system experiments (OSSEs) are verified with real data through multiple typhoon cases. It 

shows that,  for  different  typhoon, the sensitive area differ s. The perturbation on variables in the 

sens itive area of initial field leads to significant variation of typhoon prediction. 

9) An update of GRAPES Typhoon Numerical Model 

Some improvements ha ve  been made in the GRAPES typhoon numerical model and compared to 

the operational one (GRAPES -TCM), inclu ding an initial vortex scheme using the MC -3dvar 

technique, an improved convection parameterization scheme, an adjusted algorithm of the drag 

coefficient in the boundary layer parameterization scheme and increased horizontal resolution (from 

25 km to 15 km ).Preliminary verification on the updated model shows decreased error in typhoon 

track prediction in comparison to that of the GRAPES -TCM. 

10 ) The sensitivity of Typhoon model forecast to the convective  parameterization 

To better understand the influence o f two convection parameterization schemes Kain -Fritsch (KF) 

and Betts -Miller -Janjic  (BMJ) on typhoon prediction, the GRAPES -TCM is used to make sensitivity 

experiments for 44 typhoon cases. The experiment results show that the typhoon overall prediction 

wi th KF scheme is better than that with BMJ scheme. The advantage of BMJ scheme is the intensity 

prediction of strong Typhoon. The influence of the two schemes on the Typhoon track prediction has 

no obvious feature of differences. The influence of the two sc hemes on the typhoon intensity and 

precipitation prediction depends on the typhoon initial intensity. The difference of the predicted 

typhoon intensity with the two schemes is basically consistent with the difference of the predicted 

typhoon precipitation  intensity with the two schemes. 

11 ) Four stream  radioactive  transfer parameterization scheme 

Two -stream -approxi mation  is  widely used in  radioactive  transfer model in weather (typhoon) model. It 

is very accurate under clear sky conditions, with a relative e rror less than 1.5% for heating rate and 

flux. However, under cloudy conditions, cloud heating might been underestimated by as much as 

12%. The incorrect cloud absorption could affect weather and climate model behavior as cloud top 

heating is crucial to cl oud evolution. In particular, tropical cyclone is a sophisticated cloud system 

associated with deep convection. Therefore, to obtain the accurate results for cloud absorption of 

deep convection in typhoon cyclone, a more accurate scheme for radiation trans fer 

parameterizations is required. Recently, an analytical method of four stream doubling –adding method 

was developed in Shanghai Typhoon Institute. The relative error of four stream doubling in heating 

rate and flux at cloud top layer could be less than 1 %. The scheme is expected to be implemented in 

tropical cyclone numerical model to improve cloud -radiation interaction and tropical cyclone 

prediction. 51 

12 ) The preliminary results of radar data assimilation with an EnKF for Typhoon forecast 

Taking into acc ount a tropical cyclone’s characteristic of highly rotational and axi -symmetric 

circulation, the ensemble Kalman  Filter (EnKF) with flow -dependent background error covariance is 

more suitable for the TC initiation. To obtain more refined initial field, rad ar radial wind data was 

assimilated into an EnKF system. A case -study of Typhoon MORAKOT showed the positive results 

by directly assimilating the radar data. 

13 ) Study on air -sea interaction under typhoon impact 

The research about air -sea interaction under  typhoon influence is further developed in Shanghai 

Typhoon Institute. A numerical system is established by coupling the mesoscale atmospheric model, 

ocean circulation model and wave model. On this basis, numerical simulations are conducted to find 

the cha racteristics of marine elements, e.g. the upper ocean sea surface temperature and ocean 

currents, wave and wind stress under typhoon  influence . The  influence of air -sea interaction to the 

change of typhoon intensity  is also analyzed. 

To meet the demands  of develop ing  of  marine meteorological service,  China has  developed an 

operational forecast system of global ocean waves with spatial resolution of 0.5*0.5  degree  and 

forecast ing  period of 7 days. Additionally , a hydrologic numerical forecast system of Huan gpu River in 

Shanghai is also established with high resolution of decade meters, and it can provide refined 

forecast products of sea level and  ocean  current, and provide reference to urban flood control  Work 

in Shanghai,  as an improvement  it can also meet  the demands of port area routine work of Shanghai 

International Port. 

14) Study in the structure, track and intensity of tropical cyclones  in  CAMS ( Chinese Academy 

of Meteorological Science) 

 Structure 

Early re search es  indicate  that 43% typhoons have a pr e-squall line in front of typhoon. Formation of 

pre -squall line is closely related to an unstable stratification atmospheric structure and convergence 

area with high value of CAPE which is produced by typhoon. 14.7% typhoons will produce a remote 

cloud clu ster and heavy precipitation (TRP). Observational and numerical simulation demonstrates 

that the occurrence of TRP is a result of the interaction between typhoon and a mid -latitude trough. 

The rain rate and distribution of TRP depend upon the moisture tran sport of typhoon and strength of 

the trough . Topographic effect plays an important role  on  rainfall increasing. 

To study the characteristics of barotropic wave, the simulation data of mesoscale WRF model is 

applied to a barotropic shallow water equation.  The results show that there are inertial -gravity waves 

which propagate  counterclockwise  and vortex Rossby waves in Typhoon Matsa. Th ose two kinds of 

waves have different structures and stabilities ．

 Track 

The northward turning of Typhoon Megi in 2009 is ana lyzed ．The results show that the enhancement 52 

and eastward movement of Qinghai －Xizang High g ave birth to the strengthening and development 

of upper -level westerly trough. Then the South China High which move d southward to the Indo -china 

peninsula hinder ed  Me gi from moving eastward. Meanwhile, southwest basic flow resulting from the 

cross -equatorial flow ma de  a contribution to the northward turning of Megi ．

 Intensity 

National Natural Science Foundation of China program (40730948) has studied the mechanism of 

intensity change for  Landing  Tropical Cyclones (LTC) which include those typhoons approaching land, 

moving across coast and reentering ocean from land. Offshore typhoons could increase its intensity 

from the binary typhoon interaction, upper level cold vort ex overlapping and cold cloud area 

expanding. It could decrease its intensity due to not only stronger vertical wind shear but  also 

reducing of the temperature difference between upper level and low layer air column . Typhoon over 

land will be dissipated by  the land friction consuming, but 9.7% of them could revive and perhaps 

bring about heavier rainfall than it s in landfall stage. Studies reveal that both ET process and 

monsoon surges drawn into the typhoon would be the major causes to reinvigorate the rem nant of 

LTC. Mesoscale shear line (MSL) could be occurred within LTC which would reinvigorate the 

convective systems and increase rainfall. Numerical simulation indicate that the large scale inland 

water surface could alleviate the decaying rate of LTC and  activate the mesoscale convection and 

rainfall.16%  of  LTC would reenter ocean and 45.8% of them could increase its intensity. Study shows 

that ET process, out flow divergence over the LTC, vorticity and moisture transport to the remnant 

and the decreasing  of the surface friction would be the major mechanism for resuscitating of the 

remnant when it move into the  East ern  coast. The high sea  surface  temperature is  a major cause for 

the increasing of  LTC when they entering the South China Sea. 

Based on Potent ial Vorticity (PV) budget diagnosis, the causes of intensity evolution of severe 

typhoon Saomai are analyzed. The results show that the variations of vertical wind shear, vorticity 

and divergence around the  centre  of the typhoon affect ed  the variation of i ts intensity significantly. 

The PV diagnosis shows that the condensation latent heat, vertical advection and horizontal 

advection  played  different influence on its intension and decaying. 

15) Study in the characteristics of momentum exchange between the s ea and land under 

conditions of varying wind speeds 

The observations from offshore sea surface profilers of a marine observation platform were to study 

the characteristics of momentum exchange between the sea and land under conditions of varying 

wind speed s. It was found that the friction velocity U* increases with the wind speed and the drag 

coefficient Cd and roughness length Z0 first decrease wi th the increase of U10 (U10≤6 m/s), within 

the range of U10<24 m/s and then  strengthen  with the increase of wind speed; when U10>24 m/s, U* 

shows a tendency of saturation and Z0 and Cd increase, after reaching the extreme value, with the 

growth of wind spe ed. 

Figure  2.21  show s the relationship between the effective wave height and 2 -min. wind speed at the 

height of 2m under the conditions of Typhoons Molave and Chanthu. As shown in the figure, the 53 

relationship was very good in the case of Chathu (with buoy  measurements from Maoming) and the 

correlation coefficient could be as high as 0.8921 with polynomial fitting, but it was discrete for 

Molave (with buoy measurements from Shanwei) and the correlation coefficient was 0.7464, which 

wa s much smaller than that  for Maoming. It suggests, to some extent, complicated relationships 

between the effective wave height and wind speed in the coastal region offshore.
