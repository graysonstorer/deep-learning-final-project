# CHAPTER 1 GENERAL 

1.1 Introduction Typhoons have always been a major threat to the Typhoon Committee region. As a result, they are a common target for meteorological services in the region to monitor, analyse, forecast and warn against. Under the spirit of international co-operation, a regional programme to mitigate the damage due to tropical cyclones was launched by the Typhoon Committee which was established in 1968. Since its establishment under the auspices of ESCAP in co-operation with WMO, the Typhoon Committee has developed its area of activities to consist of three components, i.e., meteorological, hydrological and disaster prevention and preparedness. Of these components, the meteorological component aims at improving and upgrading the analysis and forecast used for the routine operation. For this purpose, the Typhoon Committee has arranged a variety of co-operation efforts. One of the epoch-making events in the history of the Committee was the Typhoon Operational Experiment (TOPEX), which was organized for all three components. (The third component was specifically organized as Warning Dissemination and Information Exchange Component). The Meteorological Component of TOPEX had a co-operation programme where concerted efforts were exerted to analyze and forecast specified typhoons using common technical procedures. The procedures were described in the TOPEX Operational Manual which had been utilized in meteorological services in the Typhoon Committee region during the operational phase of TOPEX. Activities of the Meteorological Component of the Typhoon Committee – including execution of the meteorological component of TOPEX for three years – had been planned and organized under the Tropical Cyclone Programme (TCP) of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The main long-term objective of the TCP is to assist Members in upgrading the capabilities of NMHSs to provide better tropical cyclone, related flood and storm surge forecasts and more effective warnings through regionally coordinated systems, and to encourage Members to establish national disaster prevention and preparedness measures. As a result of international cooperation and coordination, and with the aid of meteorology and modern technology, such as satellites, weather radars and computers, all tropical cyclones around the globe are now being monitored from their early stages of formation and throughout their lifetime. Six centres designated by WMO as Regional Specialized Meteorological Centres (RSMCs) located in Honolulu, La Reunion, Miami, Nadi (Fiji), New Delhi and Tokyo, as well as other centres of national Meteorological Services carry out these activities. These centres also provide forecasts on the behaviour of tropical cyclones, their movement and changes in intensity and on associated phenomena –principally storm surges and flash floods. The responsibility of the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center is the provision of information on tropical cyclones for Members of the Typhoon Committee. Information should include formation, movement and development of tropical cyclones and associated 2

> 2012 Edition

meteorological phenomena. In addition, synoptic scale atmospheric situation which affects the behaviour of tropical cyclones should also be prepared by the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center and disseminated to NMCs in the appropriate format for operational processing. The RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should be operational throughout the year and be manned round the clock when a tropical cyclone exists over the region concerned. The RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should also carry out non-operational functions such as training. In order to implement the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center in the Typhoon Committee region, the Regional Co-operation Programme was discussed and adopted by the Typhoon Committee at its Extraordinary Session (Manila, March 1986). At the same time, the Committee approved a draft of the Typhoon Committee Operational Manual which specifies in more detail the extent and type of activity of the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center and shows the direction of realizing the regional co-operation between Members. The Operational Manual consists of the text and the appendices. Items included in the text relate to the Typhoon Committee agreement, in particular, basic information for executing meteorological operation, whilst the appendices contain national practices and procedures (it is felt that the Member concerned should have the right to be able to change without having to get prior formal agreement of the Typhoon Committee) together with detailed and technical information for meteorological operation. Information described in WMO official publications such as Manuals is only referred to and not included in this Manual. Since March 1986, the draft of the Operational Manual has been revised and is still subject to further refinement and revision through experience gained in the use of the Operational Manual. It is also intended that the text of the Manual be updated or revised from time to time by the Typhoon Committee and that each item of information given in the appendices relating to the Manual be kept up to date by the Members concerned. 1.2 Terminology used in the region 1.2.1 General Typhoon Committee Members 1.2.2 Classification of tropical cyclones *, ** (i) Low pressure area (L) (ii) Depression or tropical depression (TD) (iii) Tropical storm (TS) (iv) Severe tropical storm (STS) (v) Typhoon (TY) 1.2.3 Tropical cyclone characteristics (i) position of centre (ii) confidence in the centre position (iii) size and shape of eye, if any (iv) central pressure (v) direction of movement (vi) speed of movement

Bulletin: Cyclone warning bulletin Central pressure of a tropical cyclone: Surface pressure at the centre of the tropical cyclone as measured or estimated. Centre fix of the tropical cyclone: The estimated location of the centre of a tropical cyclone. Centre of the tropical cyclone: The centre of the cloud eye, or if not discernible, of the wind/pressure centre. Confidence in the centre position: Degree of confidence in the centre position of a tropical cyclone expressed as the radius of the smallest circle within which the centre may be located by the analysis. "Position good" implies a radius of 30 nautical miles (55 kilometres) or less. "Position fair", a radius of 30 to 60 nautical miles (55 to 110 km) and "Position poor", a radius of greater than 60 nautical miles (110 km). Cyclone: Tropical cyclone Cyclone warning bulletin: A priority message for exchange of tropical cyclone information and advisories. Direction of movement of the tropical cyclone: The direction towards which the centre of the tropical cyclone is moving. Extra-tropical cyclone: Low-pressure system which develops in latitudes outside the tropics. 4

> 2012 Edition

Eye of the tropical cyclone: The relatively clear and calm area inside the circular wall of convective clouds, the geometric centre of which is the centre of the tropical cyclone.

Storm surge: The difference between the actual water level under the influence of a meteorological disturbance (storm tide) and the level which would have been attained in the absence of the meteorological disturbance (i.e. astronomical tide). (Storm surge results mainly from the shoreward movement of water under the action of wind stress. A minor contribution is also made by the hydrostatic rise of water resulting from the lowered barometric pressure.) Storm tide: The actual sea level as influenced by a weather disturbance. The storm tide consists of the normal astronomical tide and the storm surge. Storm warning: Meteorological message intended to warn those concerned of the occurrence or expected occurrence of average wind speeds in the range of 48 to 63 knots or wind force 10 or 11 in the Beaufort scale.

(iv) Speed (wind speed and speed of movement of tropical cyclones) in knots, the unit (kt) being stated; (v) Confidence in the centre position in nautical miles (nm) or in position good, fair or poor; (b) The following units/indicators are used in non-coded segments of exchanges, other than marine bulletins: (i) Distance in kilometres (km) or nautical miles (nm); (ii) Location (position) by degrees and tenths of degrees in figures of latitude and longitude and/or bearing on the sixteen point compass and distance from well-known fixed place(s); (iii) Direction in sixteen points of compass given in figures; (iv) Speed (wind speed and speed of movement of system) in knots (kt), metres per second (m/s) or kilometres per hour (km/h); (v) Confidence in the centre position in kilometres (km), nautical miles (nm) or in position good, fair or poor. 1.5 Identification of tropical cyclones As soon as the wind speed in a tropical cyclone in the responsible area of the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center (between 0°N and 60°N and between 100°E and 180°E) attains 34 knots, it will be given an identification name with a 4-digit number by the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center. Each tropical cyclone should be identified by one of the names in Appendix 1-C, followed by the 4-digit number in brackets, whose number will consist of a year identification and a serial number identification (in two digits each). For example, the first tropical cyclone attaining the 34 knots threshold value in 2000 in the responsible area of the RSMC Tokyo-Typhoon Center will be identified as Damrey (0001). If the life of a tropical cyclone spans two calendar years, it will be accounted for in the year in which it has intensified to the stage where the wind speed has attained the 34 knots threshold value. 1.6 Acronyms A list of acronyms used in this Operational Manual is shown in Appendix 1-D. _______________ 7

# CHAPTER 2 OBSERVING SYSTEM AND OBSERVING PROGRAMME 

2.1 Networks of synoptic land stations The surface and upper-air stations in the regional basic synoptic network are those of the Typhoon Committee Members and are registered in Weather Reporting Volume A -Observing stations (WMO Publication No. 9). The RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center and all Typhoon Committee Members should initiate enhanced observation programmes for their stations in the area within 300 km of the centre of a tropical cyclone of TS intensity or higher. All the observations should be made available to the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center and all Members. Enhanced observations should include: (i) surface observations - hourly; (ii) buoy observations - hourly; (iii) radar observations - hourly; (iv) upper-air observations - 6-hourly. 2.1.1 Surface observations All surface stations included in the regional basic synoptic network should make surface observations at the four main standard times of observation, i.e., 0000, 0600, 1200 and 1800 UTC, and at the four intermediate standard times of observation, i.e., 0300, 0900, 1500 and 2100 UTC. Any surface station that cannot carry out the full observational programme should give priority to carrying out the observations at the main standard times. Additional surface observations at hourly intervals may be requested by any Member, whenever a tropical cyclone becomes an imminent threat to the Member, from the stations shown in Appendix 2-A. 2.1.2 Upper-air synoptic observations All the upper-air stations included in the regional basic synoptic network should carry out radiosonde and radiowind observations at 0000 and 1200 UTC, and radiowind observations at 0600 and 1800 UTC. The radiosonde/radiowind observations carried out at 0000 and 1200 UTC should reach the 30 hPa level for more than 50 per cent of the ascents. The carrying out of the radiosonde/radiowind observations at 0000 and 1200 UTC should receive priority over the radiowind observations at 0600 and 1800 UTC. Upper-air stations in the areas affected by tropical cyclones of TS intensity or higher should also make radiowind observations at 0600 and 1800 UTC which should aim at reaching the 70 hPa level. Enhanced upper-air observations given in Appendix 2-B will be made as appropriate whenever a tropical cyclone of TS intensity or higher is centred within 300 km of the station. The minimum required is two observations per day, but for a better understanding of the ambient wind field three or even four ascents per day on some days should be made when possible. All data of these enhanced upper-air observations will be distributed among the Members. 8

> 2012 Edition

In addition to the upper-air synoptic observations, newly developed observations such as wind profiler observations should be carried out when possible and the data should be made available to the Members. 2.2 Ship and buoy observations Hourly marine meteorological observations are made by the JMA research vessels (call signs of them are: JPBN and JGQH) in the seas adjacent to Japan and in the western North Pacific. Upper-air observations are usually made twice a day (00, 12 UTC) on board the JMA research vessel JGQH. Enhanced upper-air observations are carried out six-hourly when these ships are in the vicinity of a tropical cyclone of TS intensity or higher. Marine meteorological observations are made by the Voluntary Observing Ships which are recruited by the Members in accordance with the WMO Voluntary Observing Ship's Scheme. These are generally carried out every six hours and transmitted over the GTS. Marine meteorological observations, namely air pressure, sea surface temperature, significant wave height and period, are also made by the JMA drifting ocean data buoys every 3 hours in the western North Pacific. When waves are higher than thresholds set beforehand, the buoy changes into the hourly observation mode automatically. All reports are coded in the BUOY code (FM18), and immediately put onto the GTS with the header “SSVB01-19 RJTD”. 2.3 Radar observations It is essential that radar observations continue as long as a tropical cyclone of TS intensity or higher remains within the detection range of the radar. All meteorological centres should co-operate to ensure that the radar observations are transmitted through the GTS to the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center and all Members. Reports will be coded in the BUFR code (FM-94) with RADOB Template (TM316050) and/or the RADOB code (FM 20-VIII). In case the report is in plain language, the full range of information available at the radar station should be given. The message will therefore include, where available, the confirmation of the determination of the centre, the shape, definition, size and character tendency of the eye, the distance between the end of the outermost band and the centre of the cyclone and the direction and speed of movement with a statement of the interval of time over which the movement was calculated. Distribution of the radar stations and detailed information on the radar equipment of the Typhoon Committee Members are given in Appendices 2-C and 2-D. 2.4 Meteorological satellite observations 

2.4.1 Satellite imagery data and related products The meteorological satellite information obtained by MTSAT and related products are operated as follows: (i) full disk data are obtained hourly; (ii) half disk data in the northern hemisphere are obtained hourly in addition to the full disk data; 9

> 2012 Edition

(iii) additional half disk data in the northern and southern hemispheres for Atmospheric Motion Vector (AMV) extraction are obtained six-hourly; (iv) AMV data are derived hourly; (v) Clear Sky Radiance (CSR) data are derived hourly from the full disk data. Detailed information is given in Appendix 2-E. A list of satellite imagery receiving facilities at meteorological centres of the Typhoon Committee Members is given in Appendix 2-F. 2.4.2 SAREP reports SAREP reports (Part A) are disseminated eight times a day in the following cases from the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center to Typhoon Committee Members through the GTS under the heading of IUCC10 RJTD in the BUFR code (FM 94): (i) when a tropical cyclone of TS intensity or higher is located in the responsible area of the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center; (ii) when a tropical depression existing in the responsible area is forecasted to have an intensity of TS or higher within 24 hours; or (iii) when an area of wind speed of 34 knots or higher caused by a tropical cyclone is forecasted to be in the responsible area within 24 hours. 2.5 Aircraft observations Reports from aircraft in flight (AIREPs) in Asia and neighbouring areas are collected and exchanged according to the Regional OPMET Bulletin Exchange (ROBEX) scheme. AIREPs are collected by the centres in the Typhoon Committee Members areas and transmitted to the ROBEX centres at Bangkok, Beijing, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur and Tokyo. AIREPs in the north-east Pacific area are also collected by the centres at Honolulu, Washington, etc., and relayed to Tokyo. AMDAR (Aircraft Meteorological Data Relay) reports are collected by the centre at Tokyo. All reports will be disseminated in real-time to the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center and to other Members through GTS and AFTN circuits. 2.6 Tropical cyclone passage report Each Member’s tropical cyclone forecast center should compile reliable passage, landfall, near-buoy passage and near-ship passage data, tabulate that data and send it to the Typhoon Committee Secretariat (TCS) within a week after cyclone passage for distribution to other Members. The task is assigned to the focal point for the meteorological component of each Member. A proposed tropical cyclone passage report form is shown in Appendix 2-G. _______________ 10

# CHAPTER 3 TROPICAL CYCLONE ANALYSIS AND FORECAST 

3.1 Analysis at RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center The RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should produce analyses of various meteorological parameters in chart form and/or in grid point value depending on the facilities of NMCs to process these products. These analyses should include pressure distribution at the sea level and temperature, geo-potential height, humidity and wind at selected pressure levels. The streamline analysis is indispensable over the tropical region for forecasting tropical cyclones. The RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should produce streamline analyses of the upper and lower atmospheric levels utilizing cloud motion wind, aircraft reports, as well as upper-air observations. Furthermore, the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should issue analyses of ocean wave and sea surface temperature for the western North Pacific. A list of products provided by the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center is given in Tables 3.1 to 3.3. The RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should produce additional analyses of the tropical cyclone when it is in the responsible area, based on the enhanced observations. Such analyses should be disseminated in the form of additional bulletins consisting of information on: (i) position of the tropical cyclone; (ii) direction and speed of movement; (iii) central pressure; (iv) maximum wind and wind distribution. Various analyses based on MTSAT data other than cloud imagery itself should be produced by the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center. Analysis of sea-surface temperature combining satellite data and in-situ measurements should be prepared every five days. These analyses are useful for the better understanding of the tropical atmosphere and medium-range assessment of forecasting tropical cyclones. 11

3.2 Forecast at RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center The RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should prepare the products for numerical weather prediction shown in Appendix 3-A. These products should be made available to Members in real-time, and should include the following: (i) deterministic forecast products of a high resolution global model to predict the change in large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns as well as the tropical cyclone movement and intensity (ii) ensemble forecast products using a lower resolution version of the global model to enable estimation of uncertainties in tropical cyclone movement and intensity as well as to reduce forecast errors by using statistical methods such as ensemble mean. The RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should also prepare several statistical models for predicting the track of the tropical cyclone and apply the Dvorak method for the prediction of the intensity change of the tropical cyclone. Other relevant synoptic methods should also be applied for predicting the tropical cyclone. The RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should summarize in a consolidated form all available information and prepare the final forecasts of the tropical cyclone when it exists in the responsible area. These forecasts should include: (i) 24, 48 and 72-hour forecast position; (ii) forecast intensity and wind distribution; (iii) prognostic reasoning; (iv) tendency assessment if possible. Furthermore, the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should prepare a 24-hour ocean wave forecast once a day for the western North Pacific. Storm surge products suitable for the Typhoon Committee region should be provided by the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center. A list of forecast products of the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center, other than alphanumeric form, is shown in Tables 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. 3.3 Operational analysis and forecast at centres of Typhoon Committee Members The national meteorological services of Typhoon Committee Members are using various kinds of operational forecast methods for typhoon track. The ones currently used are shown in Appendix 3-B. The final responsibility for analysis and forecasting development and movement of tropical cyclones in the region will be with the national meteorological services of each of the Members. In order to promote uniformity in the adoption of proven techniques, a sample of such techniques currently used by Members is given in Appendix 3-C. _______________ 17

# CHAPTER 4 TROPICAL CYCLONE WARNINGS AND ADVISORIES 

4.1 General The responsibility for warning the human settlements on land which are threatened by a tropical cyclone rests in all cases with the National Meteorological Services (NMS). These national responsibilities are not subject to regional agreement. Therefore, only the cyclone warning systems intended for international users and exchanges among the Typhoon Committee Members are described in this chapter. 4.2 Classification of tropical cyclones *, ** Classifications of tropical cyclones for the exchange of messages among the Typhoon Committee Members are given below: (i) Low pressure area (L) Central position cannot be accurately assessed (ii) Tropical depression (TD) Central position can be identified, but the maximum sustained wind is 33 kt or less. (iii) Tropical storm (TS) Maximum sustained wind is between 34 and 47 kt. (iv) Severe tropical (STS) Maximum sustained wind is between 48 and 63 kt. storm (v) Typhoon (TY) Maximum sustained wind is 64 kt or more. 4.3 Tropical cyclone advisories The RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should disseminate six to three-hourly analyses and forecasts of tropical cyclones in the form of bulletins (tropical cyclone advisories - see examples in Appendix 4-A): (i) analysis of the central position, intensity and wind distribution; (ii) 24, 48 and 72-hour forecasts of the central position; (iii) forecasts of intensity and wind distribution; (iv) prognostic reasoning; (v) tendency assessment if possible.   

> *"Tropical cyclone" is a generic term that includes tropical depression, tropical storm, severe tropical storm and typhoon.

4.4 Tropical cyclone warnings for the high seas The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) in its Manual on Marine Meteorological Services sets out the issue of weather and sea bulletins for the high seas in six parts. The first part relates to storm warnings in plain language. Areas of responsibility of each nation for issuing the storm warnings are pre-assigned. The pre-assigned forecast areas of Typhoon Committee Members were agreed upon by Regional Associations II and V (Res. 17 (IV-RA II) and Res.10 (IV-RA V)). Weather forecast areas fixed nationally by individual Typhoon Committee Members are shown in Appendix 4-B. The radio stations broadcasting tropical cyclone forecasts and warnings for the benefit of the ships on the high seas in the Typhoon Committee Members are listed in Appendix 4-C, where are shown the names of coastal radio stations with their call signs and the area covered by their bulletins. The details are shown in the Manual on Weather Reporting Volume D - Information for Shipping (WMO Publication No. 9). 4.5 Warnings and advisories for aviation In accordance with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Annex 3 -

Meteorological Service for International Air Navigation / WMO Technical Regulations (C.3.1), tropical cyclone warnings, required for the international air navigation, are issued by designated meteorological watch offices (MWO) as SIGMET messages. SIGMET messages give a concise description in abbreviated plain language concerning the occurrence and/or expected occurrence of specified en-route weather phenomena, which may affect the safety of aircraft operations, and of the development of those phenomena in time and space. Each MWO provides information for one or more specified flight information regions (FIRs) or upper information regions (UIRs). The boundaries of the FIRs/UIRs are defined in ICAO Air Navigation Plan - Asia and Pacific Region (Doc 9673). The content and order of elements in a SIGMET message for tropical cyclone shall be in accordance with ICAO Annex 3/WMO Technical Regulations (C.3.1). The data type designator to be used in the WMO abbreviated heading of such messages shall be T1T2 = WC (WMO - No. 386, Manual on GTS refers). The designated Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre (TCAC) Tokyo shall monitor the development of tropical cyclones in its area of responsibility, as determined in the ICAO Air Navigation Plan - Asia and Pacific Region (Doc 9673) and issue advisory information concerning the position of the cyclone centre, its direction and speed of movement, central pressure and maximum surface wind near the centre. The tropical cyclone advisories shall be disseminated to the MWOs by TCAC Tokyo in its area of responsibility. In addition, the tropical cyclone advisories shall be disseminated to other TCACs, whose areas of responsibility may be affected, to the World Area Forecast Centres (WAFC) London and Washington, international OPMET data banks, and centres operating the ICAO satellite distribution systems (SADIS and ISCS). The format of the tropical cyclone advisories shall be in accordance with the ICAO Annex 3/WMO Technical Regulations (C.3.1). The data type designator to be used in the WMO abbreviated heading of such messages shall be T1T2 = FK (WMO-No. 386, Manual on GTS, refers). TCAC Tokyo shall issue updated advisory information for its area of responsibility, for each tropical cyclone, as necessary, but at least every six hours. ____________ 19

# CHAPTER 5 TELECOMMUNICATIONS 

5.1 General The basic meteorological telecommunication network for the exchange of forecasts, warnings and observational data will be the Global Telecommunication System (GTS). 5.2 Dissemination of data and products The RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should have adequate telecommunication facilities for the real-time collection and dissemination of data and products. A large amount of grid point data produced at the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should be exchanged between the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center and NMCs where adequate circuits for this purpose exist, such as GTS and Internet. Conventional radio facsimile broadcasts are widely used in the region, though they have some disadvantages, i.e., it takes a long time to transmit a number of charts and received charts are sometimes distorted due to noises. Nevertheless, facsimile broadcasts and reception facilities shall be retained in full operation until telecommunications via satellite is introduced to transmit products both in chart and grid point value form. 5.3 Schedule for exchange of cyclone advisories Tropical cyclone advisories issued by the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center shall be transmitted at intervals of six to three hours. These messages shall be given high priority. 20

# CHAPTER 6 MONITORING AND QUALITY CONTROL OF DATA 

6.1 Quality control of observational data National Meteorological Centres will make additional efforts to ensure that all observational data disseminated during periods of cyclone threat to the area are specifically free from errors. Wherever appropriate, verification of reports or of elements of reports will be requested of the observing station and communication channels will be kept open to facilitate this, particularly in cases where an enhanced observing programme is being carried out. In the exchange of data during periods of cyclone threat, queries concerning reports on which there is doubt should be addressed to the relevant National Meteorological Centre. Examples of message format for inquiry on doubtful and garbled reports are shown in Appendix 6-A. 6.2 Monitoring of exchange of information Monitoring will be carried out by the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center and all Typhoon Committee Members in accordance with their standard procedures. Special attention will be given to identification of deficiencies during the cyclone season in the flow of observational data and processed information relating to cyclone analysis and forecast with a view to appropriate remedial action. The Members will inform the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center of any shortcomings in the flow of data (raw and processed) and also indicate any requirements over and above those already agreed upon for tropical cyclone warning purposes. Regular monitoring at the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should be made twice a year for appropriate periods when enhanced observations are carried out. Special monitoring may be made depending on the situation. The procedure of regular monitoring is shown in Appendix 6-B. 6.3 Verification Immediately after the dissipation of a tropical cyclone of TS grade or stronger, the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should disseminate a report on the tropical cyclone in the form of bulletins to provide Members with data needed for verification, such as position and intensity of the tropical cyclone (see the example in Appendix 6-C): After the end of each typhoon season, each Member will conduct the verification for its analyses and forecasts and send the report to the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center in accordance with the standard procedure as shown in Appendix 6-D. Verification sheets for positioning of the centre, prediction of movement, and analysis and forecast of intensity of a tropical cyclone are shown in Appendix 6-E. The RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should summarize the reports issued in a year and the results of verification conducted by Members. It should publish an annual report with respect to tropical cyclones and activities of the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center 25

# CHAPTER 7 ARCHIVAL OF DATA 

7.1 Data to be archived by Typhoon Committee Members Members should establish tropical cyclone data files and information services nationally, archiving all appropriate available data. 7.2 Data to be archived by RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center The RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should archive as far as possible tropical cyclone related data received at the centre. The data set should be produced during the period when tropical cyclone(s) is (are) in the range of 1,000 km around Typhoon Committee Members. Except for satellite imagery data, all data should be recorded by the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center preferably on electronic media. A proposed list of data to be archived by the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center is shown in Appendix 7-A. 7.3 Exchange of archived data Whenever possible Members should supply the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center with all additional data requested by the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center. The RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center should make available the archived data to Members on request for use in research, studies, investigations and training. As to distribution, similar arrangements should be made as for the TOPEX data sets which were provided by the Japan Meteorological Agency to Typhoon Committee Members (one set each) with financial assistance from UNDP. The detailed arrangements for exchange of data should be agreed upon bilaterally. Request for data sets by non-Typhoon Committee Members should be made through the WMO Secretariat upon payment of net cost (for electronic media, copying, handling, postal fees, etc.) by the requesting WMO Members. In accordance with the directive of the WMO Executive Council (EC-XLV), (Geneva, June 1993) an international format for the archiving of tropical cyclone data is to be used by all RSMCs with activity specialization in tropical cyclones. Complete historical data using the international format given in Appendix 7-B will be made available for research applications. RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center will provide such data to the Director of the National Climatic Data Center (NCDC), USA. The Tropical Cyclone Programme (TCP) Division of the WMO Secretariat has the responsibility for the maintenance of the format, including assignment of the source codes to appropriate organizations, and authorizing additions and changes. _______________ 27

GUIDELINES FOR CONVERTING BETWEEN VARIOUS WIND AVERAGING PERIODS IN TROPICAL CYCLONE CONDITIONS 

This note is based on recommendations from Harper et al. (2010) and extracts from Knaff and Harper (2010), providing advice on why, when and how “wind averaging conversions” can be made. a) Why Convert Wind Speeds? From the observational perspective, the aim is to process measurements of the wind so as to extract an estimate of the mean wind at any time and its turbulence properties. From the forecasting viewpoint, the aim is, given a specific wind speed metric derived from a process or product, to usefully predict other metrics of the wind. Typically these needs revolve around the concept of the mean wind speed and an associated peak gust wind speed; such that the statistical properties of the expected level of wind turbulence under different exposures can be used to permit useful conversions 

between peak gust wind speed estimates. b) When to Convert Wind Speeds? Wind speed conversions to account for varying averaging periods only apply in the context of a maximum (peak gust) wind speed of a given duration observed within some longer interval. Simply measuring the wind for a shorter period of time at random will not ensure that it is always higher than the mean wind (given that there are both lulls and gusts). It is important that all wind speed values be correctly identified as an estimate of the mean wind or an estimate of a peak gust .Once the mean wind is reliably estimated, the random effects of turbulence in producing higher but shorter-acting wind gusts, typically of greater significance for causing damage, can be estimated using a “gust factor”. In order for a gust factor to be representative, certain conditions must be met, many of which may not be exactly satisfied during a specific weather event or at a specific location: 

Wind flow is turbulent with a steady mean wind speed ( statistically stationary ); 

Constant surface features exist within the period of measurement, such that the boundary layer is in equilibrium with the underlying surface roughness ( exposure ); 

The conversion assumes the mean wind speed and the peak gust wind speed are at the same 

height (e.g. the WMO standard observation height +10 m) above the surface. c) How to Convert Individual Point-Specific Wind Speeds Firstly, the mean wind speed estimate V should be explicitly identified by its averaging period To in seconds, described here as VTo , e.g. 

V600 is a 10-min averaged mean wind estimate; 

V60 is a 1-min averaged mean wind estimate; 

V3is a 3-sec averaged mean wind estimate. Next, a peak gust wind speed should be additionally prefixed by the gust averaging period 

 , and the time period over which it is observed (also termed the reference period ), described here as V 

> ,To

, e.g. 

V60,600 is the highest 1-min mean (peak 1-min gust) within a 10-min observation period; 

V3,60 is the highest 3-sec mean (peak 3-sec gust) within a 1-min observation period. The “gust factor” G 

> ,To

then relates as follows to the mean and the peak gust: 

VGV To To ,, 

> 

 ,where the (true) mean wind V is estimated on the basis of a suitable sample, e.g. V600 or V3600 .

On this basis, Table 1 provides the recommended near-surface (+10 m) conversion factors G

> ,To

between typical peak gust wind averaging periods, which are a strong function of the exposure class because the turbulence level varies depending on the surface roughness. Table 1 only provides a range of indicative exposures for typical forecasting environments and Harper et al. (2010) or WMO (2008) should be consulted for more specific advice regarding particular types of exposures -especially if it is intended to calibrate specific measurement sites to “standard exposure”. 28

 To estimate the expected “off-land” 3-sec peak gust in a 1-min period, multiply the estimated “off-land” mean wind speed by 1.36 

 To estimate the expected “off-sea” 3-sec peak gust in a 10-min period, multiply the estimated “off-sea” mean wind speed by 1.38 

 To estimate an “at-sea” 1-min peak gust in a 10-min period, multiply the estimated “at-sea” mean wind speed by 1.05 Note that it is not possible to convert from a peak gust wind speed back to a specific time-averaged mean wind – only to the estimated true mean speed. Hence to estimate the “off-sea” mean wind speed given only a peak observed gust of 1-min duration ( 

 = 60 s) measured in a 10-min period ( To =600 s), multiply the observed 1-min peak gust by (1/1.11) = 0.90. This does not guarantee that the estimated mean wind will be the same as the 10-min averaged wind at that time but, because the 10-min average is normally a reliable estimate of the true mean wind, it will likely be similar. In all cases, measurement systems should aim to reliably measure the mean wind speed and the standard deviation using a sample duration of not less than 10-min (WMO 2008), i.e. V600 . Additional shorter averaging periods and the retaining of peak information should then be targeted at operational needs. d) Converting Between Agency Estimates of Storm Maximum Wind Speed Vmax 

This is a slightly different situation from converting a point specific wind estimate because the concept of a storm-wide maximum wind speed Vmax is a metric with an associated spatial context (i.e. anywhere within or associated with the storm) as well as a temporal fix context (at this moment in time or during a specific period of time). While it may be expressed in terms of any wind averaging period it remains important that it be unambiguous in terms of representing a mean wind or a peak gust. Agencies that apply the WMO standard 10-min averaged Vmax wind have always applied a wind-averaging conversion to reduce the maximum “sustained” 1-min wind value (a 1-min peak gust) that has been traditionally associated with the Dvorak method (Dvorak 1984, Atkinson and Holliday 1977)2. As noted in the previous section, it is technically not possible to convert from a peak gust back to a specific time-averaged mean wind – only to the estimated true mean wind speed. However, in Harper et al. (2010) a practical argument is made for nominal conversion between Vmax 60 and Vmax 600 

> 2 As detailed in Harper et al. (2010), this traditional assumption is without a firm basis.

2012 Edition values via an hourly mean wind speed reference, and the recommendations are summarised in Table 2. It can be noted that the recommended conversion for at-sea exposure is about 5% higher than the “traditional” value of 0.88 (WMO 1993), which is more appropriate to an off-land exposure. This has special implications for the Dvorak method because “at sea” is the typical exposure of interest where such conversions have been traditionally applied.

OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES FOR THE ASSIGNMENT OF NAMES OF TROPICAL CYCLONES 

(a) RSMC Tokyo – Typhoon Center will assign a name each time a 4-digit identification number is to be assigned. That is, names on the Typhoon Committee list will only be given to tropical cyclones of tropical storm strength or above. Each tropical cyclone should be identified by its name followed by the 4-digit number in brackets. The same names and numbers should also be used in bulletins issued by the Tokyo Tropical Cyclone Advisory Centre under the umbrella of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) as well as in bulletins for Meteorological Area (METAREA)-XI of the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS) issued by both China and Japan. This would contribute to the standardization of the usage of names of tropical cyclones as was desired by the Typhoon Committee. (b) The exchange of observational data should be promoted as much as possible in addition to what is already exchanged among the warning centres and the meteorological services in the region, to ensure that RSMC Tokyo – Typhoon Center would benefit from the best possible data and information needed for it to carry out its work. (c) On the operation of the name list, the names will be assigned following the pre-determined order. The name would remain unchanged throughout the life history of the tropical cyclone. To avoid confusion, tropical cyclones given a name before crossing the Date Line and entering the western North Pacific should be assigned a number by RSMC Tokyo – Typhoon Center but should not be assigned a new name in the Typhoon Committee list. RSMC Honolulu Hurricane Center will continue the use of the tropical cyclone names assigned by RSMC Tokyo – Typhoon Center when tropical cyclones cross the Date Line from west to east. (d) The names and numbers assigned by RSMC Tokyo – Typhoon Center will be used by all Typhoon Committee Members when issuing warning bulletins intended for the international community including the press, aviation and shipping. (e) The Typhoon Committee, as the authority to maintain the list, shall review the list of names and its operation regularly at its annual sessions as the need arises. (f) Members may request the retirement of a name from the list particularly in case of tropical cyclones causing extensive destruction or for other reasons. Such notification shall be made preferably within a year of the event. The decision to retire names should be made at the regular review at annual sessions of the Typhoon Committee. 33

Item Method Type of output Name of the method Description of the method Barotropic Model Governing equations: Three primitive equations formulated on a discrete grid in geographical coordinates. Dependent variables: geopotential height H (m), zonal U

(m/s) and meridional V (m/s) components of wind. Domain: Two nested domains. The outermost forecasting domain is fixed and extends from 20 S to 60 N, 60 E to 180 E with horizontal resolution 1.25 

(121 x 81 grid points). The inner domain is vortex -centered, movable consisting of 20 x 20 grid points with resolution of 0.25 degrees. Approximation schemes: centered finite difference for spatial approximation, Adams-Bashforth for time integration. Boundary conditions are fixed. Initial global fields H, U, V are obtained from global analysis of Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). 

Vortex initialisation scheme: bogus vortex is constructed based on the assumption that the storm motion is equal to the vector sum of the large scale environmental flow plus the vortex asymmetry (Smith and Ulrich, 1990; Smith, 1991; Smith and Weber, 1993; Weber and Smith, 1995; Davidson and Weber, 2000). A number of modifications had been done to this scheme for better representing characteristics of tropical cyclone motion near Viet Nam.

SAMPLES OF THE OPERATIONAL PROCEDURES AND METHODS FOR THE TROPICAL CYCLONE ANALYSIS AND FORECASTING 

1. The methods of tropical cyclone analysis and forecasting 

1.1 Judgement on tropical cyclone formation 

1.1.1 Satellite analysis See Appendix 3-C, p.15 (Sec. 2.2) 1.1.2 Radar analysis See Appendix 3-C, p.14 (Sec. 2.1) 1.1.3 Upper air analysis The following conditions may be assessed on an operational basis by means of upper air and streamline analyses (at the 850, 500 and/or 300 hPa levels). If the replies to the following questions are “yes” in at least one of the following cases, formation of a storm is expected. 1. Does the synoptic scale upper divergence exist over the tropical disturbance? The upper divergence favours the development of disturbance into storm. 2. Are the high level anticyclone and the warm core starting to be established or have they developed over the disturbance? These indications show a storm formation empirically. 3 Are the convergence of the moist air and the definite organized circulation observed (say, at the 850 hPa level) over the disturbance? These features show a storm formation empirically. 1.1.4 Synoptic surface analysis The following conditions may be assessed on an operational basis in the vicinity of the disturbance by means of the surface analysis. 1. Existence of a region of the surface pressure less than 1,000 hPa? 2. Existence of a region of the surface pressure fall more than 5 hPa per 24 hours. 3. Existence of a region of the surface mean wind more than 10 m/sec. Any existence of the region mentioned above may favour a storm formation. 1.1.5 Sea surface temperature (SST) analysis A large area of SST greater than or equal to 26 °C in the vicinity of the disturbance is necessary for the formation and development of the typhoon. 100

1.2 Identification of tropical cyclone / typhoon position 

1.2.1 Determination of typhoon position by means of extrapolation Central position of the typhoon can be estimated by extrapolation. This extrapolation is based on the persistence of typhoon movement in the past. 1.2.2 Radar data analysis See Appendix 3-C, p.14 (Sec.2.1) 1.2.3 Satellite analysis See Appendix 3-C, p.15 (Sec. 2.2) 1.2.4 Surface map analysis (1) The distance intersection method (with pressure profile) We assume that the strength, scale and pressure profile of the typhoon remains unchanged. 

Procedure 

Step 1. Read the surface pressure at point A and measure the distance from point A to the typhoon center in the pressure profile chart (Fig. 3-C.1) prepared at the previous map time. Draw the arc with the distance obtained (Fig.3-C.4). Step 2. Same work for several points. Step 3. The arcs do not always intersect at one point. The typhoon center must be obtained as the average of the intersecting points. Remarks: a. This method is not used in case of rapid development or weakening of the typhoon, or when the typhoon has come near to land because the pressure profile will change. b. When the isobar of the typhoon is not circular, this method will produce some error. 101

2012 Edition APPENDIX 3-C, p.10 1.5.5 Radar observation See Appendix 3-C, p.14 (Sec. 2.1). 1.5.6 Numerical weather prediction High-resolution NWP global models, including EPS systems, are generally becoming more reliable with skills comparable to the subjective forecasts issued by the forecasters. They can provide useful guidance material for estimating intensity category and trend. 1.5.7 Model output statistics (MOS) method The NWP intensity predictions can be further improved using MOS methods by establishing the statistical relationship between the analyzed intensity and forecast intensity output by the models. For example, based on the regression of model forecast central pressure against the best-track data in past years, a set of best-estimated parameters can be derived to correct the real-time NWP forecasts. Deterministic forecasts of tropical cyclone intensity derived from EPS data can also be calibrated using an artificial neural network. 

1.6 Prediction of rainfall 

Rainfall related with the typhoon are roughly divided into the following four categories; 1) vortical rain near the typhoon center, 2) orographic rainfall, 3) rainfall caused by the outer-band, and 4) rainfall caused by front in the higher latitude region. 1.6.1 Numerical weather prediction Rainfall are predicted by the primitive equation model including cumulus parameterization scheme. The predicted precipitation is, in general, smaller than the observed one, though the predicted rainfall area generally agrees well with the observed rainfall area. It should be noted that the model sometimes yields the erroneous small-scale (two grid noise) concentration of heavy rainfalls. 1.6.2 MOS method: Model Output Statistics The MOS method is based on the statistical relations between the rainfall amount and the predictors obtained from the NWP products at the grid points. Notes: Life cycle of the typhoon a. Formation stage The rate of the pressure change may fluctuate and the wind distribution may be asymmetric. b. Development stage The amount of pressure fall increases with respect to time. The intensification of the maximum wind is more remarkable than the expansion of the strong wind zone. c. Mature stage A typhoon acquires a quasi-steady state with only random fluctuations in the central pressure and maximum wind speed. However, the strong wind zone still expands. d. Decay stage Asymmetry in the pressure and wind field becomes more pronounced. 109

> 2012 Edition APPENDIX 3-C, p.12

1.6.6 Very-short range prediction of rainfall by satellite observation Qualitative analysis of rainfall area can be done using satellite picture. For the quantitative analysis techniques of rainfall area and amount, digital image data must be used. The guides for detection of rainfall area is summarized as follows: 1. Identification of convective cloud area and the thickest and/or coldest “point” area of deep convective clouds a. Draw the outlines of convective clouds. Try to discriminate cirrus anvil from convective cloud. Cirrus anvils of deep convective clouds are seen at the 200 hPa downwind areas of the clouds. b. Detect the “point” maximum rainfall area by examining the highest and/or coldest area in IR picture and shadows of overshooting Cb tops in VIS picture. In the case of Cb with cirrus anvil, the “point” area is usually near the upwind sharp end of the Cb cloud. 2. Analysis of movement and evolution of convective cloud and Cb cluster Life times of Cb’s with size of 50 – 100 km including anvil are 3 – 6 hours and those of Cb clusters are about 12 hours. Note that convective clouds in IR picture tend to continue to appear cold (white) even a few hours after convective activity and rainfall reached the peak. 3. Comparison of satellite analysis with radar analysis Analyze rainfall area out of radar detection range by referring to the relation between satellite and radar analyses within the radar detection range. 4. Microwave sensors from satellites Rainfall amount and probability of precipitation can be predicted using microwave sensors from satellites. 

1.7 Prediction of wind 

1.7.1 Synoptic method 1. The distribution of wind within the typhoon area is resultant of gradient wind and isallobaric wind in the first approximation. However, calculation of the isallobaric wind is not easy in operational basis, therefore it is obtained approximately by adding the velocity of typhoon movement to the gradient wind. 2. The maximum wind near the moving typhoon center is usually observed in the right hand side of the direction of movement. The distribution of wind speed accompanying the typhoon may be expressed as follows: Vmax in the right semicircle = Vmax in the left semicircle x K, where K is 1.2 to 1.4. 111

STANDARD PROCEDURES FOR THE VERIFICATION OF TYPHOON ANALYSIS AND FORECAST AT NATIONAL METEOROLOGICAL CENTRES 

1. General 

Each Member will verify each typhoon which affects it and summarize the verification made in a year 

2. Basis for verification 

The best initial typhoon position, central pressure and maximum sustained wind as determined from a post-analysis conducted by the RSMC. 

3. Points for verification 

(1) Error statistics in each method (bias and standard deviation) by using common work sheets as shown in Appendix 6-E. Statistical computations involve positioning of the centre, prediction of movement, and analysis and forecast of intensity of a tropical cyclone. (2) Discussion of following points; (i) relative merits of each technique, (ii) effects of inaccuracies on the forecast, (iii) effects of meagreness of available relevant real-time observations, (iv) variation from one geographical area to another, (v) climatological factors in climatological and/or statistical method, (vi) large-scale circulation pattern for giving rise to extremely poor prediction performance. 171
