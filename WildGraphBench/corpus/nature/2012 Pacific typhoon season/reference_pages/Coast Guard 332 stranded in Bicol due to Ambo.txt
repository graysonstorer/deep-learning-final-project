Coast Guard: 332 stranded in Bicol due to 'Ambo'
================================================

**Published** June 1, 2012 1:14pm 

 More than 300 people were stranded in major ports in Bicol Friday due to heavy rain brought by tropical depression "Ambo," the Philippine Coast Guard said.

 Coast Guard spokesman Lt. Cmdr. Armand Balilo said these included 280 in Tabaco (Albay) and 52 in Catanduanes, radio dzBB's Carlo Mateo reported.

 Also stranded were seven boats, 24 trucks, three buses and three cars, the report added.

 The Coast Guard said it will continue to monitor the situation, noting the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration had discouraged small fishing boats in the area from venturing to sea.

 Catanduanes province in Bicol remained under Storm Signal No. 1 as of 11 a.m.

 For his part, Office of Civil Defense Bicol head Bernardo Rafaelito Alejandro IV said a no-sailing policy is in place in areas affected by "Ambo."

 "_Hindi na_ favorable _ang alon. Dini_-discourage _namin ang_ small fishing boat _na lumabas_," he said in an interview on dzBB. **–KG, GMA News**
