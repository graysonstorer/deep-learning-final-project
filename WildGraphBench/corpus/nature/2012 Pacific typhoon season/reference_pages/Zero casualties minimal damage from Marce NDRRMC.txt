Zero casualties, minimal damage from 'Marce' — NDRRMC
=====================================================

**Published** October 4, 2012 9:04pm 

Typhoon Marce caused minimal damage and no fatalities or injuries to date, reported a National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council official Wednesday. ”We have no reports of injuries, missing or fatalities. We attained a zero casualty for Marce,” NDRRMC executive officer and concurrent Office of Civil Defense administrator Benito Ramos said in a press briefing. “Its effect is very minimal,” said Ramos, but added that the public should remain on alert as Marce is still inside the Philippine area of responsibility, even as it has started to [move away](http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/276769/news/nation/ts-marce-moving-away-from-phl-toward-vietnam) from the country. Burgos said only 25 persons, comprising five families in Martha village in San Jose, Occidental Mindoro were reported displaced when a dike partially collapsed. They are currently seeking refuge at Yau-Yaui Elementary School in Martha. According to the NDRRMC, about 4,000 other residents from Muntinlupa City, Bataan and Zambales were displaced, but have already returned to their homes. Ramos also reported that 14 student-mountaineers from the Mapua Institute of Technology were rescued after being trapped at the Papaya River Base Camp in Mariveles, Bataan since last Monday due to the rains. He said the students were rescued around 1:15 p.m. Wednesday by barangay officials, rescue workers from Mariveles Rescue Team, paramedics and police personnel. Ramos said a few areas were reported not passable to vehicles, specifically Baytown road in Taytay, Rizal due to flooding; Mompong bridge in Sablayan, Occidental Mindoro which was damaged; and Tabuk-Banaue road in Kalinga due to landslide. Ramos also said that 65 passengers were stranded at the ports of Aparri and Cagayan due to suspension of sea travel. According to PAGASA, as of 4 p.m. Thursday Marce was estimated at 200 km west of Iba, Zambales, with maximum sustained winds of 75 kph near the center and gustiness of up 90 kph.  It said Marce was moving west "slowly" and is expected to be 370 km west of Iba, Zambales, by Friday afternoon.  By Saturday afternoon, it is expected to be 580 km west of Iba, Zambales or outside the Philippine Area of Responsibility. **— BM, GMA News**
