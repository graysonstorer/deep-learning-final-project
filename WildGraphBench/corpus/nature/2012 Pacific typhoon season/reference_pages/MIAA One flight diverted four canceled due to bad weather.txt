MIAA: 1 flight diverted, 4 canceled due to bad weather
======================================================

**Published** May 31, 2012 6:00pm 

 The heavy downpour that hit Metro Manila Thursday afternoon forced the diversion of one international flight to Pampanga, and the cancellation of four domestic flights, the Manila International Airport Authority said.

 In a[post on its Twitter account](https://twitter.com/naia_miaa/status/208124585932095490), the MIAA said a Philippine Airlines flight (PR-502) from Singapore to Manila was diverted to Clark International Airport.

 PAL Flight PR-502 was expected to arrive at 2:15 p.m. at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminal 2 - at a time the rain was heavy.

 The flight's estimated arrival time in Manila was delayed to 5:25 p.m.

 On the other hand, four domestic flights were canceled due to bad weather. These were:

*    Cebu Pacific flight 5J-905 and 906 from Manila to Caticlan and Back (NAIA 3)
*    Zest Air flight Z2-220 and 221 from Legazpi to Manila and back (NAIA 4/Domestic terminal)
*    Zest Air flight Z2-202 and 203 from Manila to Marinduque and back (NAIA 4)
*    Zest Air flight Z2-352 and 353 from Manila to Tagbilaran and back.

 Heavy rain had also caused floods in many thoroughfares of Metro Manila, causing traffic jams.

 But the floods began to subside in the late afternoon. **— RSJ, GMA News**
