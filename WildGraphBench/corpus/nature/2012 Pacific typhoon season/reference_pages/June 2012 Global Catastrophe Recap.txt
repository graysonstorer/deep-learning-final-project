# Executive Summary 

 Severe weather, wildfires and Tropical Storm Debby highlight active month in the United States 

 Natural disasters in China cause more than USD3.5 billion in direct economic damages 

 Flooding events sweep across parts of Asia, Europe, North America and Africa 

The United States endured a highly active month, with multiple natural disaster perils occurring from coast to coast. The most costly event came across portions of Texas and New Mexico when severe thunderstorms pelted areas (including the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan region) with golf ball and baseball-sized hail. The Insurance Council of Texas noted that more than 100,000 claims were filed and total insured losses in the state would exceed USD1 billion. 

At the end of June (extending into early July), consecutive days of severe weather impacted central and eastern sections of the U.S. At least 28 fatalities occurred. The stretch was highlighted by a violent derecho (a fast-moving, long-lived cluster of intense thunderstorms) that left at least 15 people dead and caused more than 4.2 million customers to lose electricity during the midst of a major heat wave. As of this writing, more than 50,000 claims had already been filed as a result of the derecho. 

A separate hail event in Colorado and Wyoming caused more than USD700 million in insured losses. 

In Colorado, two major wildfires burned. The Waldo Canyon Fire in the Colorado Springs region became the most damaging blaze in state history, destroying 347 homes (with a combined housing market value of USD110.2 million) and damaging an additional 50. At least two people were killed. Also, the High Park Fire outside of Fort Collins destroyed 259 homes and left one person dead. 

Tropical Storm Debby brought multiple days of torrential rainfall and flooding to Florida, leading to the deaths of at least seven people. The system caused significant infrastructure damage and flooded more than 7,500 homes and businesses while crossing the state. Preliminary economic damages were listed at USD100 million, though this total was likely to increase as further assessments are made. 

Outside of the United States, China sustained several natural disaster impacts during June. Flooding in nearly 20 provinces left more than 70 people dead, damaged or destroyed 175,000 homes and caused at least USD3 billion in economic losses. Severe weather and multiple earthquakes caused additional fatalities, damage and economic losses of more than USD500 million. 

Also in Asia, a weakened Super Typhoon Guchol made landfall in Japan’s Wakayama Prefecture. Nearly 500 homes sustained flood damage in the country. Extreme monsoonal rainfall in India and Bangladesh left at least 232 people dead and damaged or destroyed as many as 600,000 dwellings. Flooding was also recorded in Thailand, Taiwan, Afghanistan and the Philippines. 

The United Kingdom recorded separate instances of heavy rainfall, with portions of Britain, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales reporting flood damage to homes and other structures. Also in Europe, a rare tornado struck Italy’s Venice region and caused USD12.6 million in damage. 

Australia sustained severe weather in parts of New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia during the month. A rare earthquake (magnitude-5.2) rattled Victoria though damage was minimal. Impact Forecasting | June 2012 Global Catastrophe Recap  3

The combination of hot temperatures, drought-like conditions and gusty winds fueled wildfires throughout parts of the West during the month of June (after several began in May). In New Mexico, the Little Bear Fire burned 44,330 acres (18,000 hectares) of land and destroyed 242 homes and businesses. The Whitewater Baldy Complex Fire, becoming the largest fire in state history, charred 297,000 acres (120,200 hectares) of land and cost USD22.6 million. The Wood Hollow Fire in Utah destroyed 56 structures (mostly homes) and 46,190 acres (18,700 hectares) of land; while in Montana, the Dahl Fire destroyed at least 60 homes and nearly 19,000 acres (7,700 hectares). 

Widely scattered severe weather impacted central and eastern sections of the U.S. between the 2 nd and the 4 th . The Storm Prediction Center (SPC) recorded nearly 400 reports of hail, winds and isolated tornadoes from Colorado to the Ohio Valley. The hardest-hit area came in Scott County, Missouri, where an EF-2 tornado tore through the small village community of Diehlstadt. At least three people were killed. 

Portions of Colorado and Wyoming were inundated with hail, damaging winds and isolated tornadoes on the 6 th and 7 th . According to local reports, while tornadoes affected nearly two-dozen homes during the 48-hour stretch, the vast majority of the damage sustained was due to hail – up to golfball-sized in some instances. In Douglas County, CO, snowplows were used to clear up to eight inches (20 centimeters) of hail accumulation. Total economic losses were estimated at approximately USD1.25 billion, while various insurers recorded at least 100,000 claims with payouts in excess of USD700 million. 

Significant rainfall fell across parts of the Florida panhandle, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana along the Gulf Coast between the 9 th and 11 th , leaving at least two people dead. Extensive flooding was prevalent in several counties, especially in Florida’s Escambia County, where nearly 23 inches (584 millimeters) of rain fell. Flood damage was widespread to homes, businesses, vehicles, the county jail and roads. Property damage was listed at USD150 million by the University of West Florida’s Office of Economic Development and Engagement, while infrastructure costs were at least USD24 million. 

The High Park Fire in Colorado temporarily became the state’s most destructive wildfire in history, after the blaze destroyed 259 homes and left one person dead. The fire, which was ignited on June 9 th just to the west of Fort Collins, CO by a lightning strike, charred 87,284 acres (35,300 hectares) of land and was listed as fully contained on June 30 th . The total cost to fight the blaze was USD39.2 million. Impact Forecasting | June 2012 Global Catastrophe Recap  4

Strong thunderstorms pelted parts of New Mexico and Texas between the 11 th and the 13 th , with the greater Dallas-Fort Worth, Texas metropolitan area sustaining significant hail damage. Up to baseball-sized hail was recorded in east Dallas and Grand Prairie, while golf ball-size hail occurred throughout the rest of the metro region. Damage occurred to a high volume of car windshields, roofs, golf courses, the marquee of the landmark Lakewood Theater and glass artwork at the Dallas Arboretum. According to the Insurance Council of Texas, more than 100,000 claims were filed and total insured losses were estimated to exceed USD1 billion in the state. New Mexico sustained approximately USD50 million in insured loss. 

The combination of a slow-moving frontal boundary, excessive heat and plentiful moisture helped spawn severe thunderstorms across the Upper Midwest on the 17 th and 18 th . Parts of Minnesota, the Dakotas and Wisconsin were affected, with hail (up to golf ball-sized) and damaging winds (nearly 80 mph (130 kph)) led to widespread impacts. Total economic losses were estimated at USD115 million, while various insurers received at least 12,500 claims with payouts in excess of USD70 million. 

Record rainfall on the 19 th and 20 th across northern Minnesota led to the worst flooding since at least 1972 in the greater Duluth metropolitan region. Three people were killed as flash floods and overflowing rivers led to widespread significant damage to homes, businesses, vehicles and infrastructure. Damage to public infrastructure alone was listed at USD108.7 million. Residential and commercial damages were also in the millions of dollars (USD). At least 15,000 insurance claims were filed with payouts in excess of USD75 million. 

Tropical Storm Debby brought multiple days of torrential rainfall, flooding and a coastal surge to Florida between the 23 rd and the 27 th , leading to the deaths of at least seven people. The system led to significant infrastructure damage and flooded more than 7,500 homes and businesses across the state. Isolated severe weather also spawned damaging tornadoes. A statewide emergency was declared. During the four-day stretch, local NWS offices recorded as much as 26 inches (635 millimeters) of rain, prompting widespread flooding in the Tampa, Jacksonville and Tallahassee metropolitan areas. Preliminary economic damages were listed at USD100 million, though this total was likely to increase as further assessments are made. 

The Waldo Canyon Fire became the most damaging wildfire in Colorado’s history, after being ignited on June 23 rd in the greater Colorado Springs metro region. The blaze, which burned 18,247 acres (7,380 

hectares) of land, was listed at 98% containment. At least 397 homes were damaged or destroyed, and fire officials noted that most of the damage occurred on June 26 th after winds gusting to 60 mph (95 kph) caused the fire to engulf several neighborhoods. Two people were killed. A report by the Denver Post 

determined that the combined market value of 341 of the 347 destroyed homes was approximately USD110.2 million. As further assessments are made, and claims are filed, the total overall losses are expected to be much higher. Total costs to fight the fire were listed at USD14.5 million. 

Waves of severe weather impacted central and eastern sections of the U.S. between June 28 th and the first few days of July, killing at least 28 people and injuring dozens more. The stretch was highlighted by a violent derecho event that caused extensive damage from just west of Chicago, Illinois to the Delmarva Peninsula on June 29 th . More than 4.2 million customers lost electricity while the country was in the midst of a prolonged heat wave. According to the SPC, there were 1,179 storm reports received from the storm – including 1,113 damaging wind reports (36 of which were for winds in excess of 75 mph (120 kph)). At least four states (Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and Ohio) and the District of Columbia declared a state of emergency. As of this writing, 50,000 insurance claims had already been filed.

The combination of near-record rainfall and construction work led to the flooding of Toronto, Canada’s Union Station on the 1 st , causing a substantial disruption in subway service. According to Environment Canada, up to 50 millimeters (1.96 inches) of rain fell in the metro region. The excessive water overflowed a sewer in the midst of being reconstructed, which flooded rail tracks and the station itself. 

Powerful thunderstorms ripped through southern Manitoba on the 9 th and 10 th , spawning large hail (up to golf ball-sized) and heavy rainfall. The hardest-hit areas came in the greater Winnipeg metropolitan region, where hail damaged a number of homes and vehicles. According to Manitoba Public Insurance (MPI), more than 2,500 claims were filed – which prompted the opening of a special claims center. Total insured losses were estimated to reach well into the millions of dollars (CAD). 

Hurricane Carlotta developed and made landfall in southern Mexico on the 15 th , leading to the deaths of at least seven people. The storm officially made landfall as a 150 kph (90 mph) hurricane near Puerto Escondido, Mexico in Oaxaca state. In terms of damage, flooding and high winds affected at least 29,000 homes and 2,500 businesses. Economic losses were listed at MXN170 million (USD12.4 million).
