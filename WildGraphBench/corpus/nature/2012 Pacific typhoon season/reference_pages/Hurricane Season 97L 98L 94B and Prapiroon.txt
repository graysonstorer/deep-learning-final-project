Tropical Storm Patty, Invest 98L, Prapiroon

 Stu Ostro, Senior Meteorologist, The Weather Channel 

Oct 12, 2012 12:17 am ET

**Graphical tropical update:**[Tropics Watch](https://web.archive.org/web/20121012080100/http://www.weather.com/news/weather-hurricanes/tropics-watch-hurricane-season-2012)

**TROPICAL STORM PATTY**

- Invest 97L demonstrated some of the kind of resiliency which Nadine had; that delayed its inevitable demise and has enabled it to become officially the 16th named storm of the 2012 Atlantic season.

- Models continue to show that from this point forward, brisk, shearing upper-level winds which have been present the whole time on the northwest side of the system will move in overhead, finally discombobulating it through Saturday, its top getting blown to the northeast while its lower portion detaches to the southwest and dissipates.

**INVEST 98L**

- Although Invest 98L still does not possess enough organization to be a tropical cyclone, there's a high probability that eventually, by the end of the weekend or early next week, it'll become one.

- As we head into the weekend it'll bring heavy showers and gusty winds to the Leeward Islands and possibly then Puerto Rico. Looking ahead to next week, models have been consistent in showing a steering flow pattern that'll turn the system to the north and northeast and keep it away from the U.S. but steer it close to Bermuda.

**EASTERN PACIFIC**

- Development of Invest 97E into a tropical depression or storm is possible as it moves farther away from Central America and out to sea.

**WESTERN PACIFIC**

- Typhoon Prapiroon continues drifting slowly, in an area of the ocean far from the Philippines, Okinawa and Iwo To (Iwo Jima), and is not in a hurry to travel very far anytime soon. In the longer range, next week Prapiroon is likely to accelerate toward the north and northeast, the question being whether it reaches or stays just east of Japan.

- Some of the typhoon's mid-upper level moisture will get carried by winds aloft all the way to the Pacific Northwest of the United States and contribute to heavy rainfall that will be ending the dry pattern there.

**BAY OF BENGAL**

- Invest 94B, which was a regeneration of the remnant of Tropical Storm Gaemi, moved into Bangladesh and unfortunately was deadly, with close to 20 fatalities being reported.

- The surface circulation has since weakened but convection with heavy rain is still flaring up at times well inland in northern Myanmar.
