I. Overview of tropical cyclones which have affected/impacted Member ’s 

area since the last Typhoon Committee Session 

1. Meteorological assessment (highlighting forecasting is sues/impacts) 

There were 8 tropical storm s and 1 tropical depression that entered or 

developed over Bien Dong Sea (BDS) , the Vietnam Area of Responsib ility 

(VAR) from January to 10 November 2012 . Six of them affected to Vietnam ,

they were Severe Tropical Storm Pakhar ( 1201 ), Tropical Storm Doksuri 

(1206), Typhoon Vicente (1208), Typhoon Kaitak (1213), Severe Tropical 

Storm Gaemi (1220), Typhoon Sontinh (1223). 

Table 1.1 below shows the details of TCs and TDs over Bien Dong Sea 

(BDS) up to 10 November in 2012. There were totally 9 Tropical Cyclones 

(TCs) during that time, including 1 Tropical Depression, 1 Tropical Storm, 3 

Severe Tropical Storm s and 4 Typhoons. There were 5 cases out of 9 TCs had 

entered to BDS and the rest had developed over BDS.

1.. TC #1 (Pakhar - 1201 )

Severe Tropical Storm Pakhar developed from a low pressure system in 

Bien Dong Sea (BDS) early morning on March 29 promoting the National 

Center for Hydro -Megeorological Forecasting of Vietnam (NCHMF ) named 

it as TC #1 in 2012. The TS has been characterized as an abnormal storm, the 

first tropical storm to occur over the BDS before April in 40 years according 

to the typhoon database at the NCHMF. Pakhar moved westward slowly on 

March 29 and intensified into a severe tropical storm on March 30. Due to 

interaction with land and the co oler sea surface temperature s (SST) when 

getting close to the coastline, Pakhar weakened in to a tropical storm early on 

March 31. On April 1, Pakhar made landfall near Vung Tau Province as a 

tropical depression and dissipated over land later in the day. Fi gure 2 shows 

the track of TC #1 that affected to Vietnam. 

TC #1 had formed over Bien Dong Sea (BDS) and reached Category 9

- 10 intensity , gust Category 11 – 12 intensity (Beaufort wind scale) . The 

half -hourly observations along the coastline showed that there had 6 – 7

Category wind, (gust 8 – 9 Category ) over the seaside s from Ninh Thu ận to 

Bà R ịa V ũng Tàu Province when it made landfall . The table below s hows the 

wind record of TC #1 :5

The mini mum surface pressure in V ũng Tàu station was 1002,6 hPa at 

15h00 (local time) on April 1. TC #1 brought moderate to heavy rains for the 

areas including Bình Định to Bình Thu ận Province, the southern High Land, 

and the Southeast part of Vietnam . The total p recipitation from March 31 to 

April 2 was 60 – 120mm at the High Land, 150 – 200 mm over Bình Định to 

Bình Thu ận and 100 – 200 mm for the Southeast part of Vietnam . Some 

places had particular rainfall amount such as Đồng Phú (Bình Ph ước

Province) 234 mm, V ạn Ninh (Khánh Hòa Province) 234 mm, Đồng Tr ăng 

(Khánh Hòa Province) 248 mm, Nha Trang city 255 mm and Khánh V ĩnh 

(Khánh Hòa Province) 427mm.

2.. TC #3 (Doksuri -1206 )

Early on June 27, the Nation al Center for Hydro -Meteorological 

Forecasting (NCHMF) reported that a tropical storm (TS) had formed about 

600 km to the southeast of Luzon Island ( Phillippines ). On June 29, Doksuri 

crossed Luzon and entered the Bien Dong Sea promoting the NCHMF named 

it as TC #3 . During that day, it moved north westwards quickly about 25 to 30 

km/h. Late on June 29, TC #3 made landfall over Guangdong , China . During 

June 30, TC #3 weakened in to a tropical depression then dissipated later that 

day o ver south -west ern area of Guangdong. Figure 3 shows the track of TC 

#3 that affected indirectly to Vietnam. 

TC #3 reached 9 – 10 Category intensity, gust 10 – 11 C ategory 

strength when entered the Bien Dong Sea (BDS). This TC brought moderate 

to heavy rains indirectly to the areas of Tonkin and Thanh Hóa Province. The 

total precipitation from June 30 to July 1 over Tonkin was 40 – 90 mm and 

over Thanh Hóa Province was 20 – 50 mm. Some places had particular 

rainfall amount were Hòa Bình city 110 mm, B ắc Quang (Hà Giang Province) 

115 mm, Tuyên Quang city 122 mm, Ph ủ Li ễn (H ải Phòng Province) 135 

mm .

3.. TC #4 (Vicente -1208) 

On July 20, a tropical depression had developed, about 300 km to the 

East of Luzon ( Phillippines ). A day later on July 21, the depression entered 

the North of Bien Dong Sea (BDS) and NCHMF upgraded this depression to 

a tropical storm (TS) and named it as TC #4 late on the same day. From July 

21, tropical depression then became TC #4 moved westwards primarily about 

15 to 20 km/h. From 00Z July 22, the TS moved slowly to the south then 7

veer ed to the north early on 23. On J uly 23, it had undergone an explosive 

intensification promoting the NCHMF upgraded the TS to a typhoon with 12 

– 13 Category intensity (Beaufor t wind scale) early on July 24. This typhoon 

made landfall over southeast area of Guangdong , China several hours after it 

reached its maximum intensity. After making landfall the typhoon moved 

northwestwards about 15 to 20 km/h and the NCHMF downgraded it to TS. 

Late on July 24, the TS moved southwestwards and th en weakened to a 

tropical depression. Early on July 25, after moved into the mountainous area 

of the North of Vietnam this system continued to weak and dissipated late on 

the same day. Figure 4 shows the track of TC #4 that affected to Vietnam. 

TC #4 ha d formed over the East of Philipppine s. It reached 12 – 13 

Category intensity , gust 14 – 15 Category strength after entered the Bien 

Dong Sea (BDS). The remnant of the system moved into the northeast part of 

Vietnam caused heavy rains for this area. The to tal precipitation from July 24 

to July 26 over mountainous area was 80 – 160 mm, some places had 

particular rainfall amount such as B ảo Yên (Lào Cai Province) 225 mm, Đoan 

Hùng (Phú Th ọ Province) 247 mm, Tuyên Quang city 363 mm. The Red river 

delta and Thanh Hóa Province had less much precipitation, around 20 – 30 

mm, somewhere 40 – 80 mm.

4. TC #5 (Kaitak -1213) 

At 06Z on August 14, the NCHMF issued the initial bu lletin about 

Tropical Storm Kait ak when it was about 330 km to the northeast of Luzon 

(Phillippine s). On the late afternoon of August 15, the TS entered the 8

northeast of Bien Dong Sea (BDS) promoting the NCHMF named it as TC #5 

in 2012 and classifi ed it as a Severe Tropical Storm. During the next 24 hours, 

this STS moved westwards about 20 km/h and the NCHMF declared as a 

Typhoon. From August 16, t his Typhoon moved quickly to the direction 

between West and North west about 25 km/h. At 06Z on July 17, it crossed the 

north of Lei zhou Peninsu la then entered the Tonkin gulf. About 6 hours later 

at 12Z the same day , the Typhoon weakened quickly to a Tropi cal Storm 

before making landfall at Qu ảng Ninh Province, Vietnam . After that, it 

continued to move further inland and weakened quickly into an area of low 

pressure in the Northeast part of Vietnam . Figure 5 shows the track of TC #5 

that affected to Vietnam. 

TC #5 had formed over the E ast of Phillippine and reached 11 – 12 

Category intensity , gust 13 – 14 Category strength after entered the Bien 

Dong Sea (BDS). The half -hourly observations along the coastline showed 

that there had 7 – 8 Category intensity , gust 9 – 10 Category intensity over 

Tonkin gulf and Qu ảng Ninh Province.. The table below shows the wind 

record of TC #5 :

6. TC # 7 (Gaemi -1220) 

On September 29, a tropical depression had formed, about 450 km to 

the northeast of Nha Trang (Vietnam ). During the next two days, the 

depre ssion moved slowly to the Nor the ast, about 5 km/h. At 12Z on October 

1, the depression had developed to be a tropical storm promoting the NCHMF 

raised the standby signal and named it as TC #7 in 2012. From early October 10 

2, TC #7 moved slowly to the Southe ast and had intensified to be Severe 

Tropical Storm. When the STS was about 200 km to the Southwest of Luzon 

(Phillippine s) on October 4, it started to veer to the West. During the 

following days, it moved to the dir ections between West and Southw est. On 

the afternoon of October 6, aft er entered the inshore area s from Bình Định to 

Phú Yên Province , TC #7 weakened quickly to be a tropical depression. At 

11Z the same day, the depression made landfall over Phú Yên Province then 

moved further inland and passed through Cambo dia and Thail an d the next 

days. Figure 6 shows the track of TC #7 that affected to Vietnam. 

TC #7 had formed over Bien Dong Sea (BDS) and reached 9 - 10 

Category intensity , gust 11 – 12 Category strength. It made landfall at Quy 

Nh ơn city as a tropical depression. The half -hourly observations along the 

coa stline showed that the areas from Đà N ẵng to Bình Thu ận and the High 

Land had strong wind s of 6 – 7 Category intensity , gust 8 Category . The table 

below showed the wind record of TC #7 :

TC # 8 (Sontinh -1223) 

At night on October 23, a tropical depression had developed to be a 

Tropical Storm, about 180 km to the East of Mindanao Island (Phillippine) .

The JMA named it as Sont inh . During the next two days, Sont inh almost 12 

moved quickly to northwestwards about 30 to 35 k m/h. At noon on October 

25, Son tinh entered the Bien Dong Sea (BDS) and the NCHMF named it as 

TC #8 in 2012. TC #8 had an explosive intensi fication reaching 13 – 14 

Category intensity on October 27. During its entire lifespan Sont inh almost 

moved to northwestwards and finally made landfall over Nam Định – Thái 

Bình Province at night on October 28 at 11 – 12 Category strength . After that, 

it moved along the coastline of the northeast part of Vietnam then weakened 

quickly to be a low pressure system early on October 29 before dissipated 

later the s ame day. Figure 7 shows the track of TC #8 that affected to 

Vietnam. 

The half -hourly observations along the coastline showed that when hit 

to Vietnam , Sontinh had reached 11 – 12 C ategory intensity , gust 13 – 14

2. Hydrological Assessment (highlighting water -related issues/impact) 

During the p eriod from 1 January to 20 Novem ber 20 12 , the medium and 

small floods occurred in main of the rivers in the northern Vietnam . Due to 

the affects of some tropical cyclones, some serious floods were occurred in 

main rivers in central Vietnam . Flows in the downstream of river Me kong 

system in southern Vietnam were lower than yearly average in compar e to the 

same period. 

2.1 In the North: 14 

In red river system have occurred about 8 -9 flood events , In Thai Binh 

river system have occurred about 5 -6 flood events, and most of them were 

medium and small floods .

Tieu Man flood (early flood) occurred in most of river with altitude 

from 1 to 3 m and flood peak was lower and later compared to the yearly 

average. 

The flood peaks in 2012 in upstream Hong -Thai Binh river systems 

appeared in July and A ugus t. The flood peaks higher than the alert level two 

occurr ed in Thao river (at YenBai stati on), in Lo river (at TuyenQuang 

station) and in Cau river (at DapCau station). In other stations in Hong -

ThaiBinh systems, It was higher than the alert level 1 except downstream of 

red river system that were lower than the alert level 1 

From from 24/6 to 2/8, d ue to affect of heavy rainfall in typhoon No. 4, 

a medium flood event occurred in most of rivers in the North Vietnam with 

flood amplitude from 2 to 5 m. In Da river, The maximum inflow to SonLa 

reservoir reached 7300m 3/s (5h 26/7); to HoaBinh reservoir rea ched 

7100m 3/s(1h 31/7). In Gam River, maximum inflow into TuyenQuang 

reservoir reached 3910m 3/s (9h 27/7). The flood peak in Thao river at Lao
