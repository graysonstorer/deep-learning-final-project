In the meantime, authorities in Ho Chi Minh City, where locals have not seen a typhoon with torrential rains for years, reported on Monday that more than 600 houses and schools were destroyed across the city.

The coastal district of Can Gio was the most stricken, the city’s People’s Committee told a meeting that day, adding that more than 3,200 locals had been evacuated before the typhoon made landfall.

The same situation was also reported in the southern province of Ba Ria – Vung Tau and the central province of Binh Thuan, among others.

Pakhar is the only typhoon in 30 years to make landfall in Vietnam at this time of year, VnExpress reported.

Moreover, typhoons at the beginning of the stormy season, which starts in May, usually target the northern region and gradually move southwards, it said.

Local scientists estimated that this year the East Sea will be stricken by between six and seven typhoons and tropical depressions, as compared to the four recorded last year.
