Quinta makes landfall six times in Visayas, may leave Friday

 Tropical Storm Quinta (Wukong) made at least six landfalls since it entered the Philippine area of responsibility (PAR) earlier this week.

 "Ang dinaanan niya Kabisayaan, composed ng islands kaya ganyan ang nangyaring pagkilos," PAGASA forecaster Ricky Fabregas said in an interview on dzBB radio.

 According to PAGASA, Quinta made several landfalls since Christmas evening:

*    Homonhon Is., Eastern Samar (7-8pm Dec 25.)
*    Abuyog, Leyte (12mn Dec.26)
*    Poro, Cebu (3AM)
*    Pacijan, Cebu (4AM)
*    Catmon, northern Cebu (5-6AM)

![Image 18: It shows a map of tropical storm Quinta with the affected area and expected timing](http://www8.gmanews.tv/webpics/v3/2012/12/LANDFALLS12-26.png)

**Flash flood, landslide warnings**

 "As of 5 a.m. today, Quinta's center was estimated to be in the vicinity of Pacijan island, Cebu, with maximum sustained winds of 75 kph near the center and gusts of 80 kph. It is moving westward at 20KPH towards northern Cebu," said GMA resident meteorologist Nathaniel "Mang Tani" Cruz.

 "Storm warning signal 2 is now in effect over central and eastern parts of Visayas including Dinagat province in Mindanao while warning signal 1 is hoisted over the rest of Visayas, provinces in Bicol Region and northeastern Mindanao. These areas will continue to have stormy weather conditions today, and residents are advised against possible flashfloods and landslides due to heavy to intense rainfall (10-20mm) expected within the storm's 350 km diameter. Likewise, residents living along coastal areas under signal number 2 are also alerted against big waves or storm surge," he cautioned.

 In his 7 a.m. weather update on Unang Balita —hours before Quinta hit Iloilo— Mang Tani said that the amount of rains brought by the storm could easily result in flash floods and landslides in affected areas:

**Forecast storm movement**

 Quinta entered the PAR early Monday morning, December 24, and made its first landfall in Samar on December 25.

 Fabregas said that Quinta has weakened and slowed down since making landfall, but added it is likely to stay in the PAR until the weekend.

 "By Friday nasa labas na ito," he said.

 GMA Weather forecasts as of 8 a.m., December 26, show that Quinta may leave the PAR as early as late Thursday:
