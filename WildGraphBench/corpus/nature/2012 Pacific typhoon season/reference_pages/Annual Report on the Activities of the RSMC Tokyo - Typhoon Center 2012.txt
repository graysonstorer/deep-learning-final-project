DVD for Annual Report 2012 Introduction 

The RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center (referred to here as the Center ) is a Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre (RSMC) that carries out specialized activities in analysis, tracking and forecasting of western North Pacific tropical cyclones (TCs) within the framework of the World Weather Watch (WWW) Programme of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The Center was established at the headquarters of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) in July 1989 following a designation by the WMO Executive Council at its 40th session (Geneva, June 1988). The Center conducts the following operations on a routine basis: (1) Preparation of information on the formation, movement and development of TCs and associated meteorological phenomena (2) Preparation of information on synoptic-scale atmospheric situations that affect the behavior of TCs (3) Provision of the above information to National Meteorological Services (NMSs), and in particular to ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee Members, in appropriate formats for operational processing In addition to the routine services outlined above, the Center distributes a series of reports entitled 

Annual Report on the Activities of the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center as operational references for the NMSs concerned. The reports summarize the activities of the Center and review the TCs of the preceding year. In this issue covering 2012, Chapter 1 outlines routine operations performed at the Center and its operational products, while Chapter 2 reports on its major activities in 2012. Chapter 3 describes atmospheric and oceanic conditions in the tropics and notes the highlights of TC activity in 2012. In Chapter 4, verification statistics relating to operational forecasts and the results of the Center’s numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are presented. Best track data for 2012 TCs are shown in table and chart form in the appendices. All relevant text, tables, charts and appendices are included on the DVD provided with this report. The DVD contains hourly cloud images of all 2012 TCs of TS intensity or higher within the Center’s area of responsibility. Also included is the necessary viewer software, which features various functions for analyzing satellite imagery (such as image animations) and facilitates efficient post-analysis of TCs and their environments. A setup program and a user manual for the software are included on the DVD. Appendix 8 gives an outline of the DVD and instructions on using the software. 1

## Chapter 1 Operations at the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center in 2012 

The Center’s area of responsibility covers the western North Pacific and the South China Sea (0° – 60°N, 100° – 180°E) including marginal seas and adjacent land areas (Figure 1.1). The Center carries out analysis and forecasting in relation to tropical cyclones (TCs) in the area and also provides the relevant National Meteorological Services (NMSs) with RSMC products via the Global Telecommunication System (GTS), the Aeronautical Fixed Telecommunication Network (AFTN), the Internet and other media. 

1.1 Analysis 

TC analysis is performed eight times a day at 00, 03, 06, 09, 12, 15, 18 and 21 UTC, and begins with determination of the TC’s center position. Cloud images from the Multi-functional Transport Satellite (MTSAT) are the principal source for this determination, especially for TCs migrating over data-sparse ocean areas. Information on the TC’s direction and speed of movement is extracted primarily from six-hourly displacement vectors of the center position. The central pressure of TCs is determined mainly from the CI number, which is derived from satellite imagery using the Dvorak method. The CI number also gives the maximum sustained wind speed in the vicinity of the center. The radii of circles representing winds with speeds of more than 30 and 50 knots are determined mainly from surface observation, ASCAT observation and low-level cloud motion winds (LCW) derived from cloud motion vectors of satellite images in the vicinity of the TC. 

1.2 Forecasts 

As a primary basis for TC track forecasts, JMA implements NWP using the Global Spectral Model (GSM) and the Typhoon Ensemble Prediction System (TEPS). The GSM (TL959L60; upgraded on 21 November, 2007) has a horizontal resolution of approximately 20 km and 60 vertical layers, while TEPS (TL319L60; operational as of February 2008) has 11 members with a horizontal resolution of approximately 60 km and 60 vertical layers. Using mainly TEPS, JMA extended its TC track forecast up to five days ahead as of April 2009. Further details and recent model improvements are detailed in Appendix 6. In terms of TC intensity, central pressure and maximum sustained wind speeds are forecast using the results of NWP models and the Dvorak method. Figure 1.1 Area of responsibility of the RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center 2A probability circle shows the range into which the center of a TC is expected to move with 70% probability at each validation time. The radius of the circle is statistically determined according to the speed of TC movement based on the results of recent TC track forecast verification. 

1.3 Provision of RSMC Products 

The Center prepares and distributes the RSMC bulletins listed below via the GTS and the AFTN when: - a TC of tropical storm (TS) intensity or higher exists in the Center’s area of responsibility - a TC is expected to reach or exceed TS intensity in the area within 24 hours RSMC products are continually issued while any TC of TS intensity or higher exists in the Center’s area of responsibility. Appendix 5 denotes the code forms of the bulletins.

1.4 RSMC Data Serving System Upgrade to WMO Information System 

As designated at the Sixteenth WMO Congress in June 2011, the Center introduced Data Collection or Production Center (DCPC) service under the Global Information System Center (GISC) Tokyo in August 2011. It provides NWP products such as data on predicted fields in grid-point-value (GPV) form and observational values through WIS Data Discovery, Access and Retrieval (DAR) via a new GISC Tokyo server (http://www.wis-jma.go.jp/). GSM products with resolution of 0.5 and 0.25 degrees (surface layer) and JMA SATAID Service (http://www.wis-jma.go.jp/cms/sataid/) are also available from the server through WIS DAR. All products available via the new server are listed in Appendix 7. In conjunction with the introduction of the DCPC service, the RSMC Data Serving System was terminated at the end of March 2012. 

1.5 RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center Website 

The RSMC Tokyo - Typhoon Center Website provides TC advisories on a real-time basis and a wide variety of products including TC analysis archives, technical reviews and annual reports on the Center’s activities at http://www.jma.go.jp/jma/jma-eng/jma-center/rsmc-hp-pub-eg/RSMC_HP.htm. 5

1.6 Numerical Typhoon Prediction Website 

Since 1 October, 2004, JMA has operated the Numerical Typhoon Prediction (NTP) website (https://tynwp-web.kishou.go.jp/). The site provides TC track predictions from eight major NWP centers (BoM (Australia), CMA (China), CMC (Canada), DWD (Germany), ECMWF, KMA (Republic of Korea), NCEP (USA), UKMO (UK) and JMA) to assist the NMSs of Typhoon Committee Members in improving their TC forecasting and warning services. The site includes: - Table/chart format TC track predictions from the participating NWP centers with several useful functions such as ensemble mean derivation from any combination of predictions - Weather charts from NWP models of the participating NWP centers (up to 72 hours ahead) - Results of JMA’s operational TC analysis conducted using satellite images (conventional Dvorak analysis and Early-stage Dvorak analysis) - Storm surge distribution maps for the Typhoon Committee region - Time series charts of storm surges and tides 6

2.2 Publications 

In March 2012, the 14th issue of the RSMC Technical Review was issued with the following areas of focus: 1. The Inactive Typhoon Season of 2010 2. JMA's Storm Surge Prediction for the WMO Storm Surge Watch Scheme (SSWS) In December 2012, the Center published the Annual Report on the Activities of the RSMC Tokyo -Typhoon Center in 2011 . Both publications are available on the website. 

2.3 Monitoring of Observational Data Availability 

The Center carried out regular monitoring of information exchanges for enhanced TC observation in accordance with the standard procedures stipulated in Section 6.2, Chapter 6 of The Typhoon Committee Operational Manual (TOM) - Meteorological Component (WMO/TD-No. 196) . Monitoring for the period from 1 November, 2010, to 31 October, 2012, was conducted for two tropical cyclones: 1. STS Vicente (1208), from 00 UTC on 23 July to 17 UTC on 24 July, 2012 2. TY Bolaven (1215), from 00 UTC on 25 August to 29 UTC on 29 August, 2012 The results were distributed to all Typhoon Committee Members in March 2013, and are also available on the WIS GISC Tokyo server at http://www.wis-jma.go.jp/monitoring/data/monitoring/. 8

## Chapter 3 Summary of the 2012 Typhoon Season 

In 2012, 25 TCs of tropical storm (TS) intensity or higher formed over the western North Pacific and the South China Sea. This total is almost the same as the 30-year average* frequency of 25.6. Among these 25 TCs, 14 reached typhoon (TY) intensity, 8 reached severe tropical storm (STS) intensity and 3 reached TS intensity (Table 3.1). 

3.1 Atmospheric and Oceanographic Conditions in the Tropics 

The negative anomalies of sea surface temperature (SST) that prevailed over the tropics east of 150°E from autumn 2011 to winter 2011/2012 weakened in spring 2012 and turned positive in summer of the same year. In the South China Sea, positive SST anomalies prevailed late in the year. Convective activity over the western equatorial Pacific was enhanced from spring to autumn 2012. This contributed to a near-normal number of TC formations in the year (25 in 2012 compared to 25.6 on average*). The monthly and annual frequencies of named TCs forming since 1951 are presented in Appendix 4.

3.2 Tropical Cyclones in 2012 

A total of 25 named TCs formed over the western North Pacific and the South China Sea in 2012. Monthly and 30-year average* TC formation numbers are shown in Figure 3.2, and tracks of the 25 TCs are shown in Figure 3.3. Figure 3.4 shows the genesis points of the 25 TCs (dots) and related frequency distribution for past years (1951 – 2011). The mean genesis point of named TCs forming in 2012 was at 16.2 ˚N and 133.7 ˚E, showing a westward deviation from the 30-year average* (16.2 ˚N and 137.4 ˚E). The 2012 TC season began with the formation of Pakhar (1201) late in March, which formed over the South China Sea and hit Viet Nam. Nine named TCs hit the continent from June to August and three from September to October. The total of named TCs which hit the continent was 13 during the season. From November to December, two named TCs formed and caused damage in the Philippines. Detailed descriptions of each TC forming in 2012 are included on the DVD provided with this report. Figure 3.1 Monthly mean streamlines at 850 hPa (lines with arrows) and areas with OLR values of less than 240 W/m 2 (shaded) for July 2012.

## Chapter 4 Verification of Forecasts in 2012 

4.1 Verification of Operational Forecasts 

Operational forecasts for the 25 TCs of TS intensity or higher that formed in 2012 were verified using RSMC TC best track data. The verified elements were forecasts of the center position (up to five days ahead), central pressure and maximum sustained wind (up to three days ahead). The position and intensity errors of operational forecasts for each TC forming in 2012 are indicated in Appendix 3. 

4.1.1 Center Position 

Figure 4.1 shows annual mean errors in center position forecasts covering periods of 24 hours (since 1982), 48 hours (since 1989), 72 hours (since 1997), 96 hours and 120 hours (since 2009). The errors in 2012 were 106, 200, 291, 413 and 527 km for 24-, 48-, 72-, 96- and 120-hour forecasts, respectively. The details of errors for each TC forming in 2012 are summarized in Table 4.1. The forecasts for Kai-tak (1213), which moved west-northwestward across the South China Sea, were characterized by large errors. The 96- and 120-hour forecasts for Guchol (1204) and Jelawat (1217), which recurved around Japan, also showed large errors, while forecasts for Saola (1209), Haikui (1211), Sanba (1216) and Ewiniar (1218) exhibited relatively small errors. The position errors were also compared with those determined using the persistency (PER) method*. The ratios of EO (i.e., the position errors of operational forecasts) to EP (the position errors of PER method forecasts) as percentages are also shown in Table 4.1. An EO/EP value smaller/greater than 100% indicates that the operational forecast was better/worse than the PER method forecast. The annual mean EO/EP ratios

Figure 4.1 Annual mean position errors in 24-, 48-, 72-, 96- and 120-hour operational track forecasts 13 for 24-, 48-, 72-, 96- and 120-hour forecasts in 2012 were 44% (46% in 2011), 38% (37%), 36% (36%), 38% (38%) and 43% (39%), respectively. Figure 4.2 shows a histogram of 24-hour forecast position errors. About 78% (78% in 2011) of 24-hour forecasts, 82% (89%) of 48-hour forecasts, 82% (83%) of 72-hour forecasts, 72% (69%) of 96-hour forecasts and 75% (69%) of 120-hour forecasts had errors of less than 150, 300, 450, 500 and 600 km, respectively. 

* The PER method is based on the assumption that a TC holds the same movement throughout the forecast period, and linear extrapolation for the latest 12-hour track of the TC is applied to create TC track forecasts. Position errors with the PER method are used to evaluate the relative performance of operational forecasts and model predictions.

Table 4.3 gives the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 24-, 48- and 72-hour operational central pressure forecasts for each TC forming in 2012. RMSE data for maximum wind speed forecasts are included on the DVD provided with this report. The annual mean RMSEs of central pressure and maximum wind speed for 24-hour forecasts were 12.8 hPa (11.7 hPa in 2011) and 5.7 m/s (5.6 m/s). For 48-hour forecasts, the corresponding values were 17.5 hPa (17.8 hPa in 2011) and 7.5 m/s (8.6 m/s), while those for 72-hour forecasts were 20.2 hPa (19.2 hPa in 2011) and 9.6 m/s (9.1 m/s).

4.2.1 GSM Prediction 

1) Center Position 

GSM annual mean position errors observed since 1998 are presented in Figure 4.4. In 2012, the annual mean errors for 30-, 54- and 78-hour* predictions were 123 km (137 km in 2011), 209 km (223 km) and 303 km (314 km), respectively. The mean position errors of 18-, 30-, 42-, 54-, 66- and 78-hour predictions for each TC are given in Table 4.4. 

* 30-, 54- and 78-hour GSM predictions are used as primary information by forecasters creating 24-, 48- and 72-hour operational forecasts, respectively. 

Table 4.5 shows relative GSM performance compared with results obtained using the PER method. In this comparison, TCs were classified into the three life stages of before, during and after recurvature. The definition of the stages is based on the direction of movement of each TC at individual prediction times.

2) Central Pressure and Maximum Wind Speed 

The mean errors of 30-, 54- and 78-hour GSM central pressure predictions in 2012 were +10.3 hPa (+4.4 hPa in 2011), +11.5 hPa (+3.0 hPa) and +13.8 hPa (+1.5 hPa), respectively. Their root mean square errors (RMSEs) were 19.7 hPa (16.1 hPa in 2011) for 30-hour predictions, 22.2 hPa (19.7 hPa) for 54-hour predictions and 26.1 hPa (23.9 hPa) for 78-hour predictions. The biases for 30-, 54- and 78-hour maximum wind speed predictions were -6.4 m/s (-5.4 m/s in 2011) with a RMSE of 9.7 m/s (9.2 m/s), -6.3 m/s (-4.2 m/s) with a RMSE of 10.9 m/s (10.5 m/s) and -6.9 m/s (-3.3 m/s) with a RMSE of 12.8 m/s (11.9 m/s), respectively. Figure 4.5 shows histograms of central pressure errors and maximum wind speed errors in 30-hour GSM predictions. It can be seen that the GSM has a small positive bias for central pressure prediction (left) and tends to underestimate the wind speed of TCs (right). This underestimation occurs because the model’s current horizontal resolution (about 20 km) is not fine enough to produce the TC core structure, especially when the TC is intense and small.

4.2.2 TEPS Prediction 

1) Ensemble mean center position 

The mean position errors of TEPS ensemble mean forecasts for 30-, 54-, 78-, 102- and 126-hour predictions for each TC are given in Table 4.6. The annual means of ensemble mean position errors for 30-, 54-, 78-, 102- and 126-hour predictions were 136 km (123 km with the GSM), 228 km (209 km), 322 km (303 km), 408 km and 492 km, respectively. Figure 4.5 Error distribution of GSM 30-hour intensity predictions in 2012. The figure on the left shows error distribution for central pressure, while the one on the right shows that for maximum wind speed (the error distributions of 54- and 78-hour predictions are included on the DVD provided with this report).

2) Spread-skill relationship 

Although position errors of TEPS ensemble mean forecasts were larger than those of the GSM in short-range forecasts, TEPS provides useful information on the reliability of TC track forecasts with its ensemble spread. Figure 4.6 shows the relationship between 6-hourly cumulative ensemble spreads in TC position forecasts and ensemble mean forecast position errors in 126-hour prediction. In an ideal EPS with a large number of samples, a significant position error is observed when the ensemble spread is large.

The index is based on the six-hourly cumulative ensemble spread at each forecast time. The category levels were set from the results of the pre-operational running of TEPS so that the category frequencies are 40%, 40% and 20%, respectively. Table 4.7 shows ensemble mean forecast errors classified with the reliability index. Theoretically, mean position errors with reliability level A should be smaller than those with levels B and C throughout the forecast times with a sufficient number of samples in an ideal EPS. These results suggest that TEPS provides appropriate reliability information on typhoon forecasts in 2012.

The Global Spectral Model (GSM) and the Typhoon Ensemble Prediction System (TEPS) are used in JMA as a primary basis for TC forecasts. Details on the operational numerical prediction and its application at JMA are found in JMA (2013). GSM (TL959L60) has about 20 km horizontal resolution and 60 vertical layers. TEPS (TL319L60) has 11 members with approximately 55 km horizontal resolution and 60 vertical layers. A singular vector (SV) method is employed for the initial perturbation setup. The stochastic physics scheme (Buizza et al. 1999) is also introduced in consideration of model uncertainties associated with physical parameterizations. The general specifications of GSM and TEPS are summarized in Table 6.1. Table 6.1 Specifications of GSM and TEPS NWP Models GSM (Global Spectral Model), TL959L60 TEPS (Typhoon Ensemble Prediction System), TL319L60 Resolution 20 km, 60 layers (Top: 0.1hPa) 55 km, 60 layers (Top: 0.1hPa) Area Global Global Method for initial value Global Data Assimilation System (4DVAR) Outer resolution: TL959L60 Inner resolution: TL319L60 Window: Init-3h to Init + 3h Unperturbed condition: Truncated GSM initial condition Initial perturbation: SV-based perturbation Ensemble size: 11 (10 perturbed members and 1 control member) SV target areas: Northwestern Pacific (20 N -60 N, 100 E-180 ) and vicinities of up to 3 TCs in the Typhoon Center’s area of responsibility (e.g. Fig 6.1) Forecast time (and initials) 84h (00, 06, 18 UTC) 216h (12 UTC) 132h (00, 06, 12, 18 UTC) Start of operation 21 November 2007 February 2008 (de facto from T0801) [Recent upgrades on GSM and the Global Data Assimilation System] GSM: - The stratocumulus parameterization scheme was improved (December 2012). Global Data Assimilation System: - Assimilation of atmospheric motion vector from GOES-15 (January 2012) - Upgrade of the linear radiative transfer model (RTTOV 9 to RTTOV 10: November 2012) - A Revised process for assimilating the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) Radio Occultation (RO) refractivity data was introduced (December 2012). TEPS is an ensemble prediction system used mainly for TC track forecasts up to five days ahead. Two SV calculations are introduced into the system to efficiently capture the uncertainty of TC track forecasts. One produces SVs with a spatial target area fi xed on the Northwestern Paci fi c(20 N -60 N, 100 E -180 ), and the other produces SVs whose spatial target area can be moved within a 750-km radius of a predicted TC’s position in one-day forecasting. Up to three movable areas can be con fi gured for different TCs at one initial time. If more than three TCs are present in the area of responsibility, three are selected in the order of concern as prioritized by the RSMC Tokyo – Typhoon Center. Figure 6.1 shows an example of SV spatial target areas. At this initial time, there were three TCs in the area. Figure 6.2 shows an example of TEPS forecast tracks for ROKE (TY1115). In this case, the forecasted TC track of the control member was entering into the Sea of Japan, which turned to be false, while some ensemble members predicted tracks appropriately following the observed one.
