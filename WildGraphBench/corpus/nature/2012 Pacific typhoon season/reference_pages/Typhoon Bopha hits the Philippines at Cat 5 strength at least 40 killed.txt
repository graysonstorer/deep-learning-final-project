Typhoon Bopha hits the Philippines at Cat 5 strength; at least 40 killed

Posted by:[Dr. Jeff Masters](https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/show.html), 5:00 PM GMT on December 04, 2012+32[](https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=2304#)[](http://twitter.com/share?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wunderground.com%2Fblog%2FJeffMasters%2Farticle.html&via=wunderground&text=Typhoon+Bopha+hits+the+Philippines+at+Cat+5+strength%3B+at+least+40+killed)[](http://rss.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/rss.xml)

[Typhoon Bopha](http://www.wunderground.com/tropical/tracking/wp201226_5day.html) slammed ashore on the Philippine island of Mindanao at 4:45 am local time on Tuesday morning as a Category 5 storm with 160 mph winds. Bopha is the third Category 5 typhoon to affect the Western Pacific this year, and the strongest typhoon ever recorded to hit Mindanao, which rarely sees strong typhoons due to its position close to the Equator. The death toll from the powerful storm already stands at 40, and is expected to rise. While passage over land has weakened Bopha to a Category 2 storm, the tropical cyclone is spreading torrential rains over a large portion of the southern Philippine Islands, and this will cause serious flooding problems today. The island of Mindanao is highly vulnerable to flood disasters from tropical cyclones; last year's [Tropical Storm Washi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Washi), which hit Mindanao on December 16, 2011 with 60 mph winds and torrential rains, killed over 1500 people. Before hitting the Philippines, Typhoon Bopha brought a storm surge [estimated at ten feet](http://www.oceaniatv.net/2012/12/03/palau-coastal-village-in-ruins-after-typhoon-bopha/) to the island nation of Palau, where near-total destruction is being reported in some coastal areas.

**Figure 1.** Super Typhoon Bopha as seen from the International Space Station on December 2, 2012. At the time, Bopha had top sustained winds of 150 - 155 mph. Image credit: [NASA.](http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/710833main_20121202_Bopha-ISS_full.jpg)

**Bopha: the 2nd most southerly Category 5 typhoon on record**

Bopha, a Cambodian word for flower or a girl, became a tropical depression unusually close to the Equator, at 3.6°N latitude. Tropical cyclones rarely form so close to the Equator, because they cannot leverage the Earth's rotation to get themselves spinning. Bopha became the second most southerly Category 5 typhoon on Monday at 7.4°N latitude. The record is held by Typhoon Louise of 1964, which was a Category 5 storm at 7.3°N.

There are no important changes (if at all) to the storm, and it remains a short-lived 100 kt major hurricane: [Link](http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL132012_Michael.pdf) Although I admit, I like how it has the designation of being only the fifth major hurricane to develop from a non-tropical disturbance in the satellite era (the others being Alicia in 1983, Diana in 1984, and Bob and Claudette in 1991). **Member Since:** March 7, 2007 **Posts:** 385 **Comments:** 14841

[KoritheMan](https://www.wunderground.com/blog/KoritheMan/show.html)7:24 AM GMT on December 05, 2012 In hindsight, Michael's development into a major hurricane at high latitudes, particularly from a non-tropical disturbance, should have been a dead giveaway that most tropical cyclone activity would be concentrated in the subtropics this year, especially after how much Ernesto failed to strengthen at more tropical latitudes. It's always easy to see things after the fact. **Member Since:** March 7, 2007 **Posts:** 385 **Comments:** 14841

[NoMeteorsInOlogy](https://www.wunderground.com/blog/NoMeteorsInOlogy/show.html)8:28 AM GMT on December 05, 2012 Long time no post for me. I am here in Luzon, the northern Philippine island where Manila sits. Local news reports two platoons of Army personnel missing in Mindinao when their temporary barracks was hit by a flash flood. A landslide last night claimed more than twenty people. Further, 33 drowned and 24 are missing in New Bataan from landfall. The worst will be tonight for several islands. The ground is already saturated and more rain is coming, meaning more landslides and floods. The terrain here is dotted with small, rugged mountains, most less than 2000 feet above the terrain, and primarily volcanic in formation. Heavy deforestation due to farming and illegal cutting have created areas highly susceptible to floods and landslides and mudslides. In Bananga, the village head declared "%u201CEverything is gone%u2014houses, crops...%u201D and that the typhoon victims urgently needed food. Donations can be sent to Philippine Red Cross--you can probably specify a place if the Great Recession hasn't made you a needy human being yourself. As for me--my wife and I are taking a hundred kilos of rice by bus Saturday to Batangas--the port in Luzon, and my wife has Coast Guard contacts that will get it to Bananga in Mindinao via two other islands. The village is in utter ruins and people are still being retrieved. the Television reported a seven year old girl had lost everything and everyone in her family--sisters, brothers, parents, grandparents and two uncles. THAT one motivated me to do something--anything. Will report as I have time. Fair clouds to you all. Fred **Member Since:** August 17, 2007 **Posts:** 0 **Comments:** 1038

I feel the death toll from Pablo/Bopha is just going to continue to climb as conditions ease and emergency workers and the Army is able to get into effected areas.

Lieutenant Colonel Lyndon Paniza of the Army's 10th Infantry Division said fatalities from Compostela Valley have gone up to 142, with 69 of which were from Tuesday's flashflood in New Bataan. Three of the 69 were Army soldiers. He added that there were 158 injured from Pablo's wrath. The number of those missing was unclear. Earlier reports said 258 were still unaccounted for but Paniza corrected the reports and said only 79 were missing, 58 from Compostela and 21 from Davao Oriental. In Davao Oriental, meanwhile, there were 114 reported deaths and 21 still missing, according to the Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council. Paniza also said heavy rains and strong winds whipped up by Pablo have damaged crops in Davao del Norte. Davao del Norte was affected and damage to crops, especially the banana plantations was extensive and rice fields are under water, he said. But as to fatalities we have no report coming from Davao del Norte, he added. Paniza also said evacuees from Davao del Norte have returned to their homes. Few structures left standing Social Welfare Secretary Corazon Soliman and other officials described scenes of utter devastation with houses and other structures in some towns and villages ripped apart by the most powerful storm to hit the country this year. There are very few structures left standing in the town of Cateel, she told AFP, referring to one badly hit coastal town. We need to rush to these areas body bags, medicines, dry clothes and most importantly tents, because survivors are living out in the open after the typhoon blew away homes and rooftops. The situation was just as dire in New Bataan town, which the military said saw flash floods and mudslides. The bodies are left lying on the ground in the open in New Bataan and we don't want to risk the spread of disease, Soliman said. The New Bataan dead included a soldier taking part in rescue operations, Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said. Six other army men from the same unit were missing and three were injured. It is quite sad and tragic. They were actually there to be ready to help our countrymen who may be in trouble, Roxas said. The military was scrambling helicopters and heavy equipment Wednesday to the mountain town, where rainwater had gushed down from nearby slopes, creating a deadly swirl of water, logs and rocks that crushed everything in its path. Logs and boulders blocked the narrow mountain pass leading to the town, said Major General Ariel Bernardo, commander of an army division in the area. Parts of Mindanao remained without power and telephone services, with food and clean water in limited supply. Cateel and two other towns on Mindanao's east coast remained cut off due to a collapsed bridge and fallen trees and debris blocking roads, said Corazon Malanyaon, governor of Davao Oriental province where Bopha made landfall. She said rescuers were using everything from heavy equipment to their bare hands and chainsaws to clear the roads. It's like we're running an obstacle course, Malanyaon said on local radio. About 95 percent of the town centre's structures including hospitals, private homes, private buildings had their roofs blown away, she said. Bernardo said about 200 soldiers were dispatched to help them, while emphasizing that the military was also a victim of the storm after an army patrol base and a rescue truck were washed away in New Bataan. In one of our headquarters, no bunkers were left standing and all our communication equipment has been destroyed, he said. Bopha struck Mindanao early Tuesday, bringing driving rain and strong winds that forced 87,000 people to seek refuge in emergency shelters, according to an updated civil defense office tally. It was the 16th storm this year to ravage the Philippines, which is hit with about 20 cyclones annually. In December last year Mindanao was pummeled by tropical storm Washi, which killed more than 1,200 people and left hundreds of thousands homeless. **Member Since:** September 30, 2007 **Posts:** 4 **Comments:** 10648

The 16th storm to enter the Philippines this year has so far left 51 people killed in flash floods in New Bataan, Compostela Valley, with more villagers still missing after being swept away by strong currents, the military said. Three of the 51 fatalities were soldiers. In Davao Oriental, 81 deaths were reported. The Provincial Disaster Response and Reduction Management Center in Davao Oriental said the municipality of Baganga, where Pablo made landfall, recorded the biggest number of deaths so far, with 31, followed by the adjacent town of Cateel with 30. The provincial disaster center report said 95 people were injured in Cateel while 51 were hurt in Baganga. Caraga recorded six deaths from “Pablo”, while six more fatalities were listed in the provinces of Misamis Oriental and Occidental, Siquijor and Bukidnon. A total of 21 persons were reported missing in the towns of Caraga, Baganga and Cateel, it added. The storm caused 24,000 families or 120,000 persons in Eastern Visayas, Northern Mindanao, Davao region and Caraga to flee their homes. Most of the evacuees were from Surigao del Sur with over 50,000. The towns of Baganga, Cateel and Boston remained inaccessible by land because the Mandulog Bridge in Caraga collapsed at the height of the storm. “There’s still no electricity there. The communication lines are still down,” said Col. Leopoldo Galon, chief of the civil relations group of the military’s Eastern Mindanao Command. Heavy to intense rains dumped by Pablo caused suspension of classes, power outages, and communication interruption in the areas of Central Visayas, Northern Mindanao, Davao region, Caraga and Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. Nearly 50 roundtrip domestic flights by Cebu Pacific Air and Zest Air were cancelled Wednesday. As of latest, Pablo weakened further as it hovered over Northern Palawan. **Member Since:** September 30, 2007 **Posts:** 4 **Comments:** 10648

[SSideBrac](https://www.wunderground.com/blog/SSideBrac/show.html)9:49 AM GMT on December 05, 2012 Referring to earlier discussions regarding use of Oil Pipelines for transportation of water and collection of rain water I am aware that water was (and still may be) used as a "plug" between different types/grades of Fuel in Fuel Pipelines - albeit the water "plug" and a %age of each delivery of Fuel had to be disposed of - so potentially there is a possibility to do so - whether this would work in Crude Oil Pipelines I am not sure. As a Caribbean Island dweller, I rely for the most part on rain water for drinking, washing etc and suffer no ills from it. I realise many people (especially those who insist on drinking bottle water wherever they go)will turn their noses up at this very idea and wring their hands in horror - however even if thy only collected rain water for irrigation or washing the car, they could start to make a more positive impact. **Member Since:** September 21, 2008 **Posts:** 0 **Comments:** 227

Roxas said authorities had the whole day Wednesday to conduct search and rescue operations, but the missing individuals were not located. "Really saddening that entire families may have been washed away," Roxas told ANC's "Top Story". The search and rescue operations, conducted by a team of barangay officials, soldiers and police, are moving at a slow pace because I of a Lack of equipment. "Slow and difficult because 'they are very difficult those muddy conditions, dense clay especially' those uphill, so it's really slow going," said Roxas. Roxas also said 78 people have been confirmed dead in the flashflood, but 20 remain unidentified. **Flashflood** Roxas said based on the survivors' accounts, the water may have flowed from a lake up in the mountains, creating a "waterfall" effect on the town. He said in New Bataan Several areas have been tagged as geohazard zones, but the particular barangays hit by the floods were not located near a Waterway. "**They said, there seems to pond or lake up in the mountains and it was a natural indentation to yield. So rather than the water going along the normal route of along the river or along the stream, he was like a waterfall across a broad area**, "said Roxas. He noted, however, that mining engineers in the area will still investigate the incident. Davao Oriental Roxas said he also visited Davao Oriental to assess the damage left by typhoon "Paul". He said he saw about "a hundred thousand coconut trees felled" via chopper on His way from Compostela Valley to Davao Oriental. "Left and right of the helicopter were felled hectares of coconut and banana trees. Really wiped out, "he said. Three towns in Davao Oriental, where the typhoon made landfall Tuesday morning, remain isolated. **Roxas said a Bridge Leading to the towns of Cateel, Boston and Baganga collapsed During the height of the typhoon**. He said fishing vessels are being used to distribute relief goods in the affected towns, where there about 150,000 residents. **Member Since:** September 30, 2007 **Posts:** 4 **Comments:** 10648

Curious and terrified, the residents could see only the dark horizon. The sounds of trees crashing to the ground, houses and objects toppling, the crying of children and women were all muted by the howling wind. By this time, the electricity went off, worsening the darkness that had already engulfed the town. The sun showed up several hours later, shedding light on the devastation that was everywhere. “I’ve lived here all my life and I am now 45, but I have not experienced anything like this before,” Sonny Tadanon, a fisherman and a father of nine, said at the evacuation center in the town proper here. Tadanon recounted how he saw debris flying all over town. “It was really unexpected,” he said. His brother’s wife, Nelfa, 41, said that when she returned to the village after the typhoon, all she could see was the ugly sight that typhoon Pablo had left behind. “We were just fortunate that we were spared from harm,” she said. But others were not as lucky. Dozens of people died in the province, according to Fred Bendulo, the provincial planning and development officer. “These reports came from our social welfare personnel, but we could not verify it as the towns of Cateel, Boston and Baganga were totally cut off,” he said, adding that roads were damaged and bridges had collapsed. The devastation was so extensive that Gov. Corazon Malanyaon wept. “When I gave her the initial briefing later in the day, she could not believe what she just heard and she began weeping,” Bendulo said. Malanyaon later told the Philippine Daily Inquirer that even she was so scared when the strong wind hit Mati. “I felt that it was going to put Mati down. I was also so scared, especially at the thought that many of those in the coastal areas were in a more precarious situation,” she said. What added to her burden, Malanyaon said, was that some people insisted on staying in their houses even when told to evacuate. Malanyaon said the devastation that Pablo brought to the province was only one of the major concerns. She said many people lost their livelihood as a result and people could be pushed deeper into poverty. “I cannot make the assurance that the province can take care all of their problems,” she said. In New Bataan, one of the hardest-hit areas in Southern Mindanao, disbelief was etched at every face the Inquirer saw. It was as if they were still trying to piece together the events that led to the massive devastation and deaths around them. Outside the public gymnasium, villagers waited as news about their missing kin, neighbors and acquaintances came in trickles. When a military truck ferrying rescued injured villagers, a mixed feeling was all too evident as residents stood up in anticipation of seeing somebody close to their hearts. Seven-year old Imee Sayson was among those barely breathing when plucked out of the mud by rescuers. “She was fortunately found by rescuers, but her father, Rommel, and her brother Ayel are still missing,” Red Cross volunteer Vic Paulo Bandong said. Imee was suffering from hypothermia, Bandong said. When the Philippine Daily Inquirer tried to ask her questions, her only response was: “Kaihion ko (I’d like to take a leak).” Among those still looking for relatives on Wednesday was Juniper Serato, who counts at least six family members, including his parents—Flavianas and Isaias—and sister Shiela, as among the missing. Soon, cadavers came in batches—some still unrecognizable because of the dirt and mud that covered them. “I had difficulty recognizing the faces because the bodies are bloated,” he said, pointing to several dead bodies that were laid on the ground. Some were starting to stink from being in the water for several hours. “I am so worried now,” he said, apparently holding back his emotions. According to Bandong, rescuers lacked vehicles to transport affected individuals to evacuation centers and the bodies to a place where residents can identify them. As of Wednesday afternoon, the death toll in the town was at 79, based on the tally released by the New Bataan government. **Member Since:** September 30, 2007 **Posts:** 4 **Comments:** 10648
