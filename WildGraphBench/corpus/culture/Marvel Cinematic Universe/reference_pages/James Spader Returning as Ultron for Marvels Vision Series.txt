[James Spader](https://web.archive.org/web/20240823171948/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/james-spader-explains-why-he-639240/) is returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

The Emmy-winning actor is set to reprise his role as the voice of robotic villain Ultron in Marvel Studios’ untitled Vision series, the follow-up series to its acclaimed _[WandaVision](https://web.archive.org/web/20240823171948/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/wandavision/)_ show. He first played the role in 2015’s _[Avengers: Age of Ultron](https://web.archive.org/web/20240823171948/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/avengers-age-ultron-film-review-790246/)_.

[Paul Bettany](https://web.archive.org/web/20240823171948/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/paul-bettany/) is reprising his role as Vision, the android who fell in love with the Scarlett Witch and then was destroyed by Thanos in A _vengers: Infinity War_. In _WandaVision_, he returned via magic and the power of grief but also as a rebuilt android, now ghostly white.

Terry Matalas, the much-heralded showrunner of _Star Trek: Picard_, is spearheading the new show, which has been referred to as _[Vision Quest](https://web.archive.org/web/20240823171948/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/vision-quest/)_ although that is not its official title and which tackles white Vision’s search for a new purpose in life.

Adding to the show’s mythological mix is Ultron, who, as Marvel fans know, was a sentient being created by Tony Stark, aka Iron Man, to act as a defense program but instead turned against humanity. He then created his own sentient being, who happened to be Vision, in order to have help in destroying the human race, but luckily for Earthlings, this “son” turns against his “father” to help the Avengers defeat the bad guy. (Got all that? If not, just rewatch _Avengers: Age of Ultron_.)

Ultron was seemingly destroyed at the end of the movie so it is unclear how he would return and what kind of relationship he would have with Vision.

The series is meant to be the third part of a trilogy that started with _Wandavision_ and continues in _Agatha All Along_, which debuts in September on Disney+. The new show is eying a shoot in England in early 2025.

Spader is a longtime actor whose career has straddled both film and TV. Movies such as _Sex, Lies and Videotape_ and _Pretty in Pink_ established him for the ’80s generation, while starring in _Boston Legal_ earned him awards and TV bonafides. He did a stint on _The Office_ and spent 10 seasons creepily starring on NBC crime show _The Blacklist_, which aired from 2013 to 2023.

The actor is repped by CAA.
