_Echo_ Will Introduce ‘Marvel Spotlight’ to Help Ease Your Canon Malaise
========================================================================

Marvel is lightening the load, sort of. After releasing [the trailer for _Echo_](https://web.archive.org/web/20240107163520/https://www.vulture.com/2023/11/echo-trailer-release-date.html) — starring Alaqua Cox as the deaf Choctaw hero who made her debut appearance in [2021’s _Hawkeye_](https://web.archive.org/web/20240107163520/https://www.vulture.com/tv/hawkeye/) — Marvel’s head of streaming, Brad Winderbaum, is distancing it from the MCU narrative. The series will be the first to be positioned under the company’s new banner, “Marvel Spotlight,” according to [Marvel](https://web.archive.org/web/20240107163520/https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/echo-screening-choctaw-day-celebration). He explained the banner as “a platform to bring more grounded, character-driven stories to the screen, and in the case of _Echo_, focusing on street-level stakes over larger MCU continuity.” In short, it’ll signal to watchers that you won’t need 30-plus movies’ worth of canon knowledge to tune into _Echo_. Honestly, who has the time?

Projects under the banner will begin with a fancy-schmancy new logo. Complete with a score from prolific composer Michael Giacchino (and director of Marvel’s _Werewolf Within_), the “Marvel Spotlight” concept is pulled straight from the comics under the same name in the ’70s, as that anthology series brought to life characters like Ghost Rider, Werewolf by Night, and Spider-Woman. “Just like comics fans didn’t need to read Avengers or Fantastic Four to enjoy a Ghost Rider Spotlight comic, our audience doesn’t need to have seen other Marvel series to understand what’s happening in Maya’s story,” Winderbaum said. Well, we’ll see about that! [We’ve been lied to before](https://web.archive.org/web/20240107163520/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2019/11/09/no-you-wont-have-to-watch-the-disney-marvel-tv-shows-like-wandavision-to-understand-the-marvel-movies-like-doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness/?sh=3327882f1c4a).
