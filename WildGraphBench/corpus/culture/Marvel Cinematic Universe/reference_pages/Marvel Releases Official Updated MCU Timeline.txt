[Marvel](https://www.marvel.com/articles/movies/marvel-cinematic-universe-timeline-disney-plus) has released an official update Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline to coincide with the release of [_Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_](https://comicbook.com/category/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness/)and[_Ms. Marvel_](https://comicbook.com/category/ms-marvel-tvshow/)on Disney+. There's also the upcoming release of [](https://comicbook.com/category/thor-love-and-thunder-comicmovie/)_[Thor: Love and Thunder](https://comicbook.com/category/thor-love-and-thunder-comicmovie/)_ in theaters – but of course, Marvel won't confirm anything about that film's timeline until it's already out.

Here's the updated MCU timeline, in chronological order:

![Image 2: marvel-releases-new-mcu-timine-doctor-strange-2-ms-marvel.jpg](https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2022/06/23/8b1ba7d2-ae8d-4cee-b337-40a98ab0e65a/marvel-releases-new-mcu-timine-doctor-strange-2-ms-marvel.jpg?auto=webp&width=1200&height=628&crop=1.911:1,smart)
### "Find the Marvel Cinematic Universe in Timeline Order for Disney+ — as of today! — is below and stay tuned for what comes next!

*   _Captain America: The First Avenger_
*   _Captain Marvel_
*   _[Iron Man](https://comicbook.com/category/iron-man-comicmovie/)_
*   _Iron Man 2_
*   _Thor_

_Discover the [Marvel Studios](https://comicbook.com/category/marvel-studios/) in Timeline Order on Disney+ and start streaming the latest timeline additions, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and Ms. Marvel."_

As we previously reported, the only real surprise here is having Doctor Strange 2 take place after the events of Eternals. Yes, Eternals was released in theaters before Multiverse of Madness, but fans have fairly argued that Doctor Strange and the Masters of the Mystic Arts should've been aware of what happened in Eternals – and so far, there's no good really good explanation as to why they didn't. Of course, that explanation could be as easy as Doctor Strange 2's events happen in such close proximity to Eternals there was no time. As always with the MCU, the devil is in the details (and that's not a Mephisto reference).

As further stated, this timeline update won't last long, with _Thor: Love and Thunder_ just weeks away from release. There's also [She-Hulk](https://comicbook.com/category/she-hulk-tvshow/), that mysterious Halloween special, and the [Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special](https://comicbook.com/category/guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special/) all coming in 2022 – not to mention Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. So again, don't get too attached to the current MCU timeline, as it's gonna get shifty, real quick.

You can catch _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_ and _Ms. Marvel_ streaming on Disney+.
