March 20, 2018 2:05PM PT

Disney is amping up its [Marvel](http://variety.com/t/marvel/) superhero attractions at the [Disneyland Resort](http://variety.com/t/disneyland-resort/) in California, [Disneyland Paris](http://variety.com/t/disneyland-paris/), and [Hong Kong Disneyland](http://variety.com/t/hong-kong-disneyland/) in 2020.

The Walt Disney Company announced Tuesday that the California Adventure part of the 63-year-old Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, Calif., will see the Guardians of the Galaxy, Iron Man, Spider-Man, and other characters from the [Marvel](http://variety.com/2018/film/news/black-panther-billion-global-box-office-1202723326/) Cinematic Universe in attractions and a new live show in 2020. Disney said the new attractions have been developed in partnership with Marvel Studios and Marvel Themed Entertainment.

The California Adventure attraction will become a “completely immersive Super Hero universe,” anchored by “Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: BREAKOUT!” in the space currently occupied by the kiddie attraction “A Bug’s Land.” The park closed “It’s Tough to Be a Bug” on March 19 and the rest of the land will close in late summer.

Disney bought Marvel in 2009 for $4 billion in what turned out to be a bargain for the entertainment giant.
