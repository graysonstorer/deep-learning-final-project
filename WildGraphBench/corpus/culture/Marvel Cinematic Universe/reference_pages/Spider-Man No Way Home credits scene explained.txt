# Spider-Man: No Way Home credits scene explained

It won't be a surprise to know that [_Spider-Man: No Way Home_](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a38511903/spider-man-no-way-home-review/) has some added treats for fans during and after the credits.

The post-credits scene does something a bit different for the MCU, so [we've got that covered over here](https://www.digitalspy.com/a38522556/spider-man-no-way-home-doctor-strange-2-trailer/). However, the mid-credits scene is very much in the MCU's wheelhouse with an exciting tease of what's to come.

In order to delve into it though, we obviously need to go into some major **spoilers**for the scene itself (and a connected movie), so look away now if you haven't seen _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ yet.

You don't want to ruin it for yourself, trust us.

Spider-Man: No Way Home credits scene explained
-----------------------------------------------

The mid-credits scene catches up with Eddie Brock (Tom Hardy) and Venom hanging out at a bar in Mexico, where Eddie is extremely baffled by what the bartender (played by _Ted Lasso_'s Cristo Fernández) has been telling him.

"You're saying this whole place is, just, tons of super people," he says. "There was a billionaire, he had a tin suit, and he could fly. Right? And there was a really angry green man."

Eddie also mentions a "purple alien who loves stones", which is certainly one way to describe Thanos. Having finally accepted what the bartender is saying, Eddie announces that he intends to head to New York to "speak to this Spider-Man", but all Venom wants to do is skinny dip.

Before they can do either, Eddie starts to disappear as he's pulled back into his universe from the MCU. It's a result of the spell Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) casts at the end of _No Way Home_, but a spot of Venom's symbiote is left behind on the bar after Eddie has left.

Venom: Let There Be Carnage

Sony Pictures

The scene is connected to [_Venom: Let There Be Carnage_'s post-credits scene](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a37970151/venom-let-there-be-carnage-post-credits-scene-explained/) where we saw Eddie shift into a new universe. In that sequence, he saw J Jonah Jameson (JK Simmons) talking about the "Spider-Menace" and now we know for sure it took place at the same time as _No Way Home_.

In the movie, Doctor Strange's spell to make the world forget who Spider-Man is initially goes wrong. He manages to contain it, but a few villains slip through as the spell pulls in anybody "who knows Peter Parker is Spider-Man" into the MCU from other universes.

It's not quite clear why Eddie would find himself in the MCU as a result of this spell though as he has no idea who Peter Parker is, let alone that Peter swings around New York as Spider-Man.

Perhaps Venom knows, as he talks in the _Venom 2_ credits scene of having "80 billion light-years of hive knowledge across universes". It stands to reason this "hive knowledge" would contain something about Peter Parker being Spider-Man, so maybe Venom was pulled in by the spell and Eddie just had to go along for the ride.

Eddie Brock in Venom: Let There Be Carnage

Sony Pictures

Either way, it's another exciting development for Spider-Man and Venom fans who have long-wished for both characters to battle it out on the big screen. Whether it'll happen in [_Spider-Man 4_](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a38511637/spider-man-4-release-date/) or [_Venom 3_](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a37707283/venom-3-release-date/) remains to be seen, but it's definitely one step closer.

The only obstacle to overcome is that by the end of _No Way Home_, they are in different universes so one of them would have to cross over again. Yes, a part of the symbiote is now in the MCU, but we'd be surprised if the MCU decided to have its own Venom given how popular Tom Hardy is in the role.

And surely they wouldn't risk going the dark Spidey route as we all saw how that turned out in _Spider-Man 3_...

**_Spider-Man: No Way Home_ is out now in cinemas.**
