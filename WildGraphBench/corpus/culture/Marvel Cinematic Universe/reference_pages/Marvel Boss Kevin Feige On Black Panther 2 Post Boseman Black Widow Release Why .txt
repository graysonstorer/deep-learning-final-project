Vision and Wanda await someone or something that will build out the MCU.Disney+

The Disney+ series _[WandaVision](https://deadline.com/tag/wandavision/)_ is the first property to launch the fourth phase of the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://deadline.com/tag/marvel-cinematic-universe/), one which will dovetail between big screen features and streaming series.

But with Disney planning to make as many [as ten Marvel Disney+ shows](https://deadline.com/2020/12/disney-launch-20-marvel-star-wars-tv-series-over-the-next-few-years-1234654195/) in the next few years, is it an embarrassment of riches?

Following _WandaVision, The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,_ a spinoff series of _Captain America_ will debut this year on Disney+ followed by _Loki,_ based on _Thor_‘s bad seed brother.

It wasn’t too long ago that Disney’s Lucasfilm sought to emulate a Marvel feature spinoff strategy with its _Star Wars_ movies. Unfortunately, that was halted after the dismal B.O. results of _Solo: A Star Wars Story;_ a situation of too much, too soon. In the wake of _Solo_, Disney is building out the deeper universe of _Star Wars_ through streaming, with future shows like _The Book of Boba Fett_ and _Ahsoka,_ among others, while hatching _Star Wars_ movies in new worlds, of which Marvel Boss [Kevin Feige](https://deadline.com/tag/kevin-feige/) is overseeing one ([Deadline recently broke the news](https://deadline.com/2021/01/loki-michael-waldron-kevin-feiges-star-wars-movie-as-part-of-newoverall-deal-with-disney-1234665495/) that pic is being penned by _Loki_ EP Michael Waldron).

Deadline landed some time with Feige this afternoon to ask him about how this new symbiotic relationship between its prized $1 billion-grossing comic book movies and Disney+ streaming series would work, and whether theatrical is bound to come up short in the long run.

_WandaVision,_ which drops on Jan. 15, marks the first time that a Marvel streaming series has centered around two _Avengers_, in this case Scarlet Witch and Vision (ABC TV series _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ did star Clark Gregg’s agent Phil Coulsen from the earlier MCU movies. He died in _Avengers_ and was brought back to life for the show. For the most part, except for _Captain Marvel,_ he largely stayed out of the latter MCU movies while the series was on the air).

20th Century Fox

Exploiting a popular franchise concurrently between TV and film isn’t anything new, though it’s not a perfect science. In 1998, Fox released the big screen movie _X-Files: Fight the Future_($189M) which built off the show’s most recent TV season. And in 1999, Paramount had the movie _South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut_ ($83M WW) while the animated series was airing on Comedy Central. Neither were massive blockbusters, yet neither did any overall damage to the their respective franchises. _X-Files_ would run for another four years after the 1998 movie spawning a 2008 feature and two revival series in 2016 and 2018. _South Park,_ which first launched in August 1997, is contracted to be on the air though 2022. That said, both IPs’ legacies were defined by their TV runs.

Still, Marvel has succeeded by swinging for the fences, and not being deterred in their execution. Hence, this new call-and- answer between Marvel movies and streaming series could very well be the next big thing as we come out of the pandemic.

_**Sidney Poitier is known to have dispensed the following [advice to Denzel Washington](https://deadline.com/2017/02/denzel-washington-fences-viola-davis-sidney-poitier-clint-eastwood-steven-spielberg-interview-1201868847/): ”If they see you for free all week, they won’t pay to see you on the weekend.” Which brings me to: Is there any concern about the overexpansion of the MCU on streaming, that it’s going to impact the films at the box office?**_

**Kevin Feige:** Well, it’s not free. And, it is not dissimilar to the worries I’ve had in my first few years at Marvel. Because the Marvel rights were separated among multiple studios, there would be multiple Marvel movies a year. There was one year when there were three in one summer. The question was ‘Whoa, how is this going to last? How is this going to survive?’ And my answer then when I had no control over anything, was ‘As long as they’re different, as long as they’re unique and some of the characters might crossover and the Marvel logo is at the front.’ But if they’re unique and interesting stories, that doesn’t go out of style. Finding something interesting and unique to watch at home, and eventually being back in a movie theater is how we escape, is how we learn, and is how we grow. It’s our job as storytellers to utilize that format and tell interesting, different stories that happen to be based in 80 years of amazing narrative fiction of the Marvel comics and can tap into all the different genres. A black-and-white half-hour sitcom is very different very anything we’ve done before. It happens to star two Avengers and has the Marvel logo on it, but is wholly unique and that is what we had been working on for Disney+ and phase 4 features until we finalized _Endgame._

**_What’s so amazing about_ WandaVision _is that it’s so avant-garde. You know something is going on underneath the veneer, but its satirical approach is very different. What gave you and Marvel creators confidence that fans would go down this rabbit hole with you? These are two very serious characters, and I would never imagine them in anything satirical._**

Disney

**Feige:**Confidence is — I don’t know if I’m the most confident guy in the world. I think we always question things, but we don’t let fear guide us in our choices either. So, I believe there is a healthy balance somewhere. From the start of Marvel Studios, we always said we don’t want to make one kind of movie. When _Iron Man_ worked, the first thing we announced was a WWII movie (_Captain America_) and a Norse God alien movie (_Thor_), and then a team-up movie (_Avengers)._ So we always look to take the success or the goodwill that comes to us, and utilize that to expand to grow into _Guardians of the Galaxy,_ and into _Black Panther_ and _Captain Marvel._ And _WandaVision_ was just an extreme version of that, and doing it in a way that will have answers and will take the confusion, or the oddity or avant garde nature of it and begin to put into piece, as each episode is unveiled week by week. But we’ve always been rewarded for taking big swings and not for repeating ourselves necessarily. And we had great confidence in those two actors playing those two characters and that they could absolutely pull it off.

**_We know with Monica Rambeau in_ WandaVision, _her character connects into_ Captain Marvel 2 _,_ and that the series connects to Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness _. Is_ WandaVision _a ramp to the revival of_ X-Men _you’re planning?_**

**Feige:**In hindsight, in five years if when we’re talking about everything that’s happened, everything can be a ramp to everything, specifically though, yes, Monica in _Captain Marvel 2_ and specifically to Wanda teaming up with Doctor Strange in the _Multiverse of Madness._

_**It was announced at Disney Investor Day that you would not recast another actor in the role of T’Challa for**_**[Black Panther 2](https://deadline.com/tag/black-panther-2/)**_**following Chadwick Boseman’s death**_ _**. Can you tell us more about that? Will this be similar to what was done in Tron where a younger Jeff Bridges was replicated via CG? Or is this a whole different angle on**_**Black Panther 2?**_**There’s been rumors that it will have a female angle.**_

Black Panther Disney

**Feige:**So much of the comics and that first movie is the world of Wakanda. Wakanda is a place to further explore with characters and different subcultures. This was always and initially the primary focus of the next story. We’re not going to have a CG Chadwick and we’re not recasting T’Challa. Ryan Coogler is working very hard right now on the script with all the respect and love and genius that he has, which gives us great solace, so it was always about furthering the mythology and the inspiration of Wakanda. There’s also the task of honoring and respecting the ongoing learnings and teachings from Chad as well.

**_Do you think_[Black Widow](https://deadline.com/tag/black-widow/)_will stick to a theatrical release or go to Disney+? And what is your take on sending certain movies to streaming? Does it damage the brand, or do you think the audience is smart enough to decipher that we’re in the exception of a pandemic and that eventually we’ll come back to the movies?_**

Black Widow Marvel Studios

**Feige:**If I had a crystal ball, I’d look into it and tell you. I don’t. All I can tell you is that for the past three years, since Bob Iger brought me into his office and talked about a streaming platform that would become Disney+ and asked us to start working on programs for it. Our long lead plan was to have the MCU and the storytelling woven between weekly episodic big swings on Disney+ and into the feature big swings in theaters. It’s my great hope that that continues. Don’t ask me week by week what is going to happen in this world, I have no idea and don’t want to guess. Everything we’ve done at Marvel Studios has been based in ‘Ok, if everything goes perfectly, here’s what we’d like to do.’ And until this past year, things have gone remarkably well. And it’s my hope that the world gets back on track and we all get back into theaters, and that people will see and experience week by week for the low monthly fee of Disney+ of what we’re brining there, and then be excited to get together with people again in real life and sit with strangers and share an experience on the big screen.

**_Will you ever revive any of the [Netflix](https://deadline.com/tag/netflix/) Marvel series like_ Luke Cage, or Jessica Jones,_etc. or is that era completely over?_**

**Feige:**Well, certainly you’ve seen what we announced at Comic-Con a year and half ago and on Disney Investor Day a few weeks ago, so that’s our focus. But I’ve been at Marvel long enough to never say never about anything.
