# Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness Easter Eggs & MCU References

**Warning! [Spoilers ahead for _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_](https://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-multiverse-madness-spoilers-story-reveals/)**

_[**Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness**](https://screenrant.com/tag/doctor-strange-2/)_ is now in theaters, featuring a justified multitude of Easter eggs and references in its reality-hopping adventure. Starring Benedict Cumberbatch's titular sorcerer as he seeks to protect a young new hero with the power to destroy every universe in existence, Stephen Strange is quite literally flung across the multiverse in this epic new chapter of the MCU. As such, many of the Easter eggs featured involve variants of the same character, new characters introduced who live in alternate realities, as well as new uses of magic as Doctor Strange encounters Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch (a reunion that isn't quite so happy).

Unlike some of the more self-contained MCU projects that have recently been released,_Doctor Strange 2_ is massive in scope with a plethora of connections. Not only are there ties to the MCU but there are also many that connect to other aspects of Marvel Comics which exist elsewhere in the vast multiverse that's been introduced. Teasing [future installments such as _Doctor Strange 3_](https://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-3-movie-news-updates-cast-story/) and even a future _Avengers-_ level crossover,the new Marvel film exists as an anchor point for what's ahead.

There are plenty of references for eagle-eyed and well-read fans of the comics to find in _Doctor Strange 2._ The film's heavy use of magic is a goldmine of Easter eggs with several spells that can be found on the page. However, there are plenty of callbacks to past films in the MCU as well as references to other popular Marvel projects. Here's every Easter egg and MCU reference in _Doctor Strange 2_.

Defender Strange
----------------

The first Stephen Strange that America Chavez teams up with in _Doctor Strange 2_ is a variant wearing his Defenders costume from the comics when the original team was Hulk, Namor, Silver Surfer, and himself. The look is made complete with a ponytail (much to the primary Strange's distaste). It's also revealed that [Defender Strange was the Sorcerer Supreme](https://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-2-defender-variant-raimi-spiderman-universe/) of his universe and could speak Spanish.

Book Of Vishanti
----------------

A book of magical power with the ability to grant a sorcerer whatever they require to achieve victory, the Book of Vishanti was created by the first Sorcerer Supreme Agamotto and the god-like entities known as the Vishanti. Held in a space between universes, the book was sought after by multiple Stranges in _Doctor Strange 2_ in an attempt to fight the Scarlet Witch.

The Darkhold
------------

The antithesis of the Book of the Vishanti, the [Darkhold is a tome known as the Book of the Damned](https://screenrant.com/wandavision-darkhold-book-damned-mcu-dark-magic/). Taken from Agatha Harkness by Wanda Maximoff at the end of _[WandaVision](https://screenrant.com/tag/wandavision/)_, the corruptive power of the book darkened Wanda's soul, making her desperate to be reunited with her children no matter the cost.

"Grand Calculus Of The Multiverse" (No Way Home Quote)
------------------------------------------------------

Before Defender Strange's death, he attempted to kill America Chavez and take her power to travel the multiverse. Claiming that it would be for the greater good, Strange used the same quote and logic as primary Strange in _[Spider-Man: No Way Home](https://screenrant.com/tag/spider-man-homecoming-3/)_:"_In the grand calculus of the multiverse, their sacrifice means far more than their deaths._" While the MCU's Strange was referring to letting Spider-Man's multiversal foes die, the alternate Defender Strange uses the same logic to justify his attempt to kill America.

Gargantos/Shuma-Gorath
----------------------

Gargantos was another monster attempting [to kidnap America Chavez](https://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-2-america-chavez-powers-origin-explained/). Resembling the classic Doctor Strange foe Shuma-Gorath but renamed due to copyright reasons, Gargantos being summoned by the Scarlet Witch to do her bidding resembles the Strange Supreme in _Marvel's What If...?_ where he summoned his own supernatural creatures.

Doctor Strange Summoning Axe
----------------------------

During the fight with Gargantos, Doctor Strange summons a battle axe which may very well be the Axe of Angarruumus. This was a powerful weapon he wielded in the comics in a 2015 comics run by Jason Aaron and Chris Bachalo.

Comics Spells Used Against Gargantos
------------------------------------

During the Gargantos fight, some of the spells displayed by Doctor Strange and [the current Sorcerer Supreme Wong](https://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-sorcerer-supreme-wong-title-better-reason/) look to have comics counterparts such as the Demons of Denak (the giant disembodied monster hands). The Chains of Krakkan are used to try and shackle the creature as well.

Spider-Man Conversation
-----------------------

Spider-Man and the events of _Spider-Man:_ _No Way Home_ are brought up during Doctor Strange and Wong's conversation with America Chavez about the multiverse. This includes a familiar confusion about where exactly his webs shoot out of (resembling Tom Holland's curiosity about Tobey Maguire's organic webs).

WandaVision Theme
-----------------

Realizing that Gargantos was summoned using witchcraft, Doctor Strange suggests that they get the help of Wanda Maximoff. At this moment, the theme from the Disney+ series is heard, preceding a transition to Wanda still dreaming about her children in the fantasy life she created (and was forced to destroy) in the[fake reality around the town of Westview.](https://screenrant.com/loki-wandavision-vision-westview-fake-reality-mock/)

Other Masters Of The Mystic Arts
--------------------------------

Preparing for the Scarlet Witch's inevitable attack in her desire to claim America and her power, Kamar-Taj was fortified while other Masters of the Mystic Arts arrived from across the globe to provide support. This includes the masters from Scotland, one of which greeted Wong by saying, "_what an honor it is to court death with you once more_”. As such, the "courting death" line feels like a call back to Thanos the Mad Titan.

Master Hamir
------------

While Strange and Wong fought Wanda outside, America Chavez was seen being protected by Master Hamir. Master Hamir was the sorcerer whom Stephen initially assumed was the Ancient One in the first _[Doctor Strange](https://screenrant.com/tag/doctor-strange/)_.

Rintrah The Minotaur
--------------------

[Rintrah the Minotaur](https://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-2-rintrah-powers-comics-minotaur-explained/) can be seen among the assembled Masters of the Mystic Arts. A classic character from the comics, Rintrah is actually an alien born with a propensity for magic. At one point, he even became Doctor Strange's apprentice for a time and is currently a full-fledged sorcerer teaching at Strange's school for the magically gifted in the comics.

Vision's Infinity War Death
---------------------------

While Vision's role was limited in _Doctor Strange 2_, his presence was still felt preceding the Scarlet Witch's battle with Kamar-Taj. The perceived pointlessness of having to rip a hole in Vision's head fueled her rage and desire to get her children back.

Scarlet Witch References The Ring
---------------------------------

Finding a way into Kamar-Taj, Wanda entered the temple from a reflection in a gong, her body twisting and contorting as she came out of it headfirst, not unlike Samara in _The Ring._

Vipers of Valtorr
-----------------

While [protecting America from the Scarlet Witch](https://screenrant.com/is-scarlet-witch-a-villain-in-marvel-comics/), Doctor Strange sued the Vipers of Valtorr, another classic spell from the comics.

Living Tribunal
---------------

Escaping through the multiverse using America's volatile powers, Strange and Chavez were flung across several different universes. However, the first one they jumped through looked to be the home of the Living Tribunal, a massive cosmic entity tasked with safeguarding the multiverse. This also ties back to Mordo in the first _Doctor Strange_, whose chief weapon was the Staff of the Living Tribunal.

Bruce Campell Cameo (Sam Raimi Tradition)
-----------------------------------------

Arriving at Earth-838, Doctor Strange and America begin exploring their new surroundings when they have an altercation with a vendor known as "The Pizza Poppa" played by Bruce Campbell. A Campbell cameo is a tradition for movies directed by Sam Raimi, and _Doctor Strange 2_ is no exception. Campbell also has cameos in the original _Spider-Man_ trilogy and many other Raimi films.

Mordo Gives Strange A Lando Calrissian Greeting
-----------------------------------------------

While [Strange was expecting a fight with Karl Mordo](https://screenrant.com/what-if-mordo-doctor-strange-plan-stupid/), this alternate 838 version of Mordo saw Strange as a friend. The moment of tension broken by a surprisingly friendly reunion resembles Lando Calrissian's greeting to Han Solo in _The Empire Strikes Back_ and is paid off in a not dissimilar way.

McLeod Books Opposite The Sanctum Sanctorum
-------------------------------------------

Across from the Sanctum Sanctorum is a bookstore named McLeod Books. This could be a reference to Bob McLeod, Marvel artist and creator of Marvel's New Mutants.

Sands of Nisanti
----------------

Tricking Stephen and America, Mordo used the Sands of Nisanti to put them both to sleep. In the comics, the Sands of the Nisanti can temporarily negate magical abilities.

Wanda Maximoff's House
----------------------

During the Scarlet Witch's dream-walking attempts where she puppets the 838 Wanda, the Maximoffs home is the same home Wanda created in _WandaVision_.

Billy and Tommy Watching Snow White And More
--------------------------------------------

When the alternate Billy and Tommy first debut on Earth-838, an _Oswald the Lucky Rabbit_ cartoon is playing in the background (Disney's precursor to Mickey Mouse). Later,_Snow White_ _and the Seven Dwarfs_ is on the television, coinciding with their Scarlet Witch encounter, potentially hinting at themes of good and evil and the importance of mirrors, both to [Scarlet Witch's travel](https://screenrant.com/scarlet-witch-darkhold-magic-tree-thor-yggdrasil/) earlier in _Doctor Strange 2_ and to the mirror dimension.

Mount Wundagore (Major Comics Location)
---------------------------------------

[Needing the power of the original Darkhold](https://screenrant.com/mcu-phase-4-scarlet-witch-darkhold-spells-comics/), Wanda travels to Wundagore Mountain which is a major location in the comics with ties to the Elder God Chthon. Wundagore was where the chaos god wrote the Darkhold. It would also become home to the villain known as the High Evolutionary. It was also the original birthplace of Wanda and Pietro in the comics.

Baxter Foundation
-----------------

As revealed by 838's Christine Palmer, the Baxter Foundation is a research group tasked with cataloging and studying the known multiverse. In the comics, the Baxter Building is the home of the Fantastic Four with the Foundation being run by Reed Richards, the 838 version or Redd Richard is played by John Krasinki as a member of this universe's Illuminati.

Black Bolt (Inhumans Series Actor)
----------------------------------

Another member of the Illuminati, [Black Bolt is the powerful king of the Inhumans](https://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-2-black-bolt-inhumans/). He's also played by Anson Mount who played the primary 616 Black Bolt in the brief _Inhumans_ television series.

Chthon (Chaos Demon)
--------------------

Finding her throne as the Scarlet Witch at the top of Wundagore Mountain, Wanda was approached by giant stone golems resembling Chthon himself. As revealed by Wong, Chthon was the First Demon with the comics confirming that he was the first black magician in the Marvel Universe.

Professor Xavier's Music and Chair From X-Men '97
-------------------------------------------------

The debut of the X-Men's Professor Xavier as the Illuminati's final member featured him in his classic green suit and yellow hover-chair from the 1997 _X-Men_ animated series. Composer Danny Elfman incorporated the theme from the series as well.

Incursions (Secret Wars)
------------------------

The Illuminati's focus on preventing incursions in the multiverse teases both the original and the 2015 [Marvel Comics events known as _Secret Wars_](https://screenrant.com/avengers-5-secret-wars-superhero-fight-versus-answers/). Both stories saw worlds and realities colliding with devastating results, something that could very well be the perfect foundation for an upcoming _Avengers-_ level crossover in the MCU.

Dead Thanos
-----------

During a flashback to the Illuminati killing their wayward version of Doctor Strange, Thanos the Mad Titan can be seen, having been slain by the heroes of Earth-838 on the moon of Titan.

Xavier Quote From Days of Future Past
-------------------------------------

Believing in Doctor Strange's ability to be different than his variants, Xavier reveals to Strange the location of the Book of Vishanti. He also quotes his iconic line from _[X-Men: Days of Future Past](https://screenrant.com/tag/x-men-days-of-future-past/)_: "_Just because someone stumbles and loses their way, doesn't mean they are lost forever_."

Ultron Drones
-------------

Serving as the Illuminati's security force, one of the drones confirms that they're versions of Ultron after being decapitated by the Scarlet Witch. The drone is also voiced by Ross Marquand who voiced Ultron in _Marvel's What If...?._

Mr. Fantastic's Family
----------------------

[As revealed by Krasinski's Mr. Fantastic](https://screenrant.com/john-krasinski-mister-fantastic-casting-mcu-future/), this version of Reed Richards has a wife and children. This would presumedly be his wife Sue Storm, their son Franklin and daughter Valeria as seen in the comics. The number 4 on his chest also implies that the Human Torch and Thing exist in this universe as well.

Black Bolt's Death (Matrix Reference)
-------------------------------------

While Black Bolt was one of the Illuminati's heaviest hitters with his ability to create shockwaves using his powerful voice, the Scarlet Witch simply removed his mouth which ended up killing him. This resembles Agent Smith removing Neo's mouth in the first _Matr_ _ix_ film.

Peggy Carter's Captain America Music And Classic Quote
------------------------------------------------------

While fighting Wanda, Peggy Carter's Captain Britain repeats the classic "_I can do this all day_"Captain America line. The 2011 Captain America theme is sampled in the score as well.

616 Mordo Trying To Kill Strange (No More Sorcerers)
----------------------------------------------------

Confronting 838's Mordo, [Strange reveals that his version of Mordo](https://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-baron-mordo-backstory-future-explained/) has already tried to kill him in the past. This is a callback to the post-credits scene from the first _Doctor Strange_ when Mordo announced his intentions to get rid of all sorcerers. Apparently, he's already made some attempts in between films.

Maximoff Family Deaths
----------------------

The last Illuminati member standing, Xavier enters Wanda's mind in an attempt to free the 838 Wanda from the Scarlet Witch. Surrounding them is rubble from a destroyed apartment while an air siren goes off, showing that Wanda's subconscious has partially recreated the traumatic moment when she and her brother Pietro lost their parents in [Sokovia (as seen in _WandaVision_)](https://screenrant.com/wandavision-scarlet-witch-age-ultron-sokovia-plothole-missile/).

Donna Strange
-------------

Ending up in a universe suffering from an incursion thanks to a Sinister Strange, this version of the Sorcerer Supreme wanted proof that the 616 Strange was a true variant. In response, Strange tells his counterpart about their sister Donna who drown in a frozen lake. This follows the comics where Donna suffered a cramp while swimming with Stephen failing to save her.

Music Duel (Bach and Wagner)
----------------------------

The duel of Stranges in this incursion universe sees the two sorcerers turning music notes and melodies into projectiles and shields. During their battle, pieces from Bach and Wagner can be heard throughout [Elfman's musical score for _Doctor Strange 2_.](https://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-2-soundtrack-marvel-movie-music-scores/)The piano that helps to commence this duel is also a great callback to the piano Stephen used to play prior to the accident that damaged his hands, setting him on his path to sorcery.

"There Was No Other Way" (Infinity War/Endgame)
-----------------------------------------------

Multiple moments of _Doctor Strange 2_ put focus on the idea of there being no other way to save the multiverse, just like there was no other way to beat Thanos in _[Avengers: Infinity](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers-3/)[War](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers-3/)_ than for several heroes to lose, as Doctor Strange had foreseen using the Time Stone. However, the culmination of Strange choosing another way to save the multiverse by trusting America contradicts that idea, suggesting that _Infinity War_ was the exception and not the rule.

Doctor Strange's Third Eye
--------------------------

At the end of _Doctor Strange 2_, the 616 version of Strange develops his own third eye just like the one Sinister Strange had. In the comics, this was the true Eye of Agamotto which helped Stephen resist and fight back against the Dark Arts. However, it's possible that his dabbling in necromancy via the Darkhold has resulted in a much darker version of his third eye.
