[Martin Scorsese](https://www.indiewire.com/t/martin-scorsese/) made headlines throughout October for condemning [Marvel](https://www.indiewire.com/t/marvel/) movies as equivalent to the offerings of a theme park. “It isn’t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being,” he said [during an interview with Empire](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/martin-scorsese-marvel-movies-not-cinema-theme-parks-1202178747/) that blew up everywhere online. “The Irishman” director later elucidated his comments at the BFI London Film Festival, stating that Marvel is “not cinema, it’s something else… We shouldn’t be invaded by it. We need cinemas to step up and show films that are narrative films.”

On Monday, The New York Times [published an op-ed essay](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html) penned by Scorsese himself, titled “I Said Marvel Movies Aren’t Cinema. Let Me Explain.” In the piece, Scorsese further unpacks his controversial remarks. He argues that, while there is genuine technical artistry behind the tentpole releases of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and their superhero brethren, they don’t offer the mystery and sense of discovery found in the cinema he grew up with and champions as both filmmaker and moviegoer.

“Many franchise films are made by people of considerable talent and artistry. You can see it on the screen. The fact that the films themselves don’t interest me is a matter of personal taste and temperament. I know that if I were younger, if I’d come of age at a later time, I might have been excited by these pictures and maybe even wanted to make one myself. But I grew up when I did and I developed a sense of movies — of what they were and what they could be — that was as far from the Marvel universe as we on Earth are from Alpha Centauri,” he wrote in the NYT op-ed.

He went on to say that cinema is about “revelation, aesthetic, emotional and spiritual,” and about “characters — the complexity of people and their contradictory and sometimes paradoxical natures, the way they can hurt one another and love one another and suddenly come face to face with themselves.”

For Scorsese, that is all absent in the MCU. He wrote that while “many of the elements that define cinema as I know it are there in Marvel pictures,” ultimately “what’s not there is revelation, mystery or genuine emotional danger. Nothing is at risk. The pictures are made to satisfy a specific set of demands, and they are designed as variations on a finite number of themes.”

Scorsese’s opinion piece further echoed his claim that Marvel movies are corporate product. “That’s the nature of modern film franchises: market-researched, audience-tested, vetted, modified, revetted and remodified until they’re ready for consumption,” he wrote. Even more bluntly, he framed his argument in context of many of the filmmakers he believes to be cinema artists: “Another way of putting it would be that they are everything that the films of Paul Thomas Anderson or Claire Denis or Spike Lee or Ari Aster or Kathryn Bigelow or Wes Anderson are not.”

Scorsese also offered a cautionary message about the current state of exhibition, and Hollywood’s emphasis on tentpole output that, he believes, is suffocating genuine artistic vision. “If people are given only one kind of thing and endlessly sold only one kind of thing, of course they’re going to want more of that one kind of thing.”

It’s kind of sad, really. Scorsese uses his demi-god status in the film industry to make, let’s be honest, not very risky (certainly not “brutal” hahaha), reductionist statements about the most popular form of theater currently. And everyone eats it up because people love to hate on goliath. True, many Marvel films are garbage. But not all. Not by a long shot Some are actually huge steps forward in the genre (Winter Soldier, Civil War, Black Panther) some are just plain fun(Ragnarok,Guardians). Conversely, many of Scorsese’s films are dull, caricatured rehashing of his obsessive interest in the mafia genre. I’m sure many of his colleagues would consider him light-weight in comparison with filmmakers like Godard, Fellini, Werner Herzog, Tarkovsky. I mean HE IS. He makes easy to relate to films with fairly large budgets that appeal to the masses. They don’y challenge you in the least. In fact they indoctrinate you into there own f-upped romanticized thinking. Not a lot of real risk taking there. It’s just so disingenuous. I’m sure he’s watched movies that are not “cinema”. I mean come on, is he that dull? He’s never watched The Adventures of Robin Hood? A film that evokes immense pleasure, was a blockbuster in its day but is absolutely never going to be mistaken for high art. To be fair, Scorsese admits would likely enjoy Marvel films if born at a certain time. Which totally undermines his argument against them. He’s essentially saying he’s an old, out of touch, fart. Which, of course, he is.

“It isn’t the cinema of human beings trying to convey emotional, psychological experiences to another human being.” With all due respect to Scorsese, there are many examples of exactly that in the MCU movies:

 * Family assembling from unrelated people by choice and some chance: Guardians of the Galaxy and the Avengers generally.

 *Do you join the system and try to reform it from within, or maintain your independence and oppose its flaws from the outside? Civil War.

 *Brotherhood or deep friendship between people who grew up together but their lives took very different routes; Captain America and Bucky.

 *Learning to live with the parts of yourself you don’t like: Hulk/Banner.

 *The road to hell is paved with good intentions: Age of Ultron.

 *One person’s “collateral damage” is another’s lifechanging disaster: Civil War.

This argument really just boils down to whether you have good taste or you don’t. I have enjoyed a Marvel movie here and there, but they quickly became tedious. Like eating junk food or candy for every meal.

In his description of what these movies lack, he literally describes what the last 4 movies of the Infinity Saga did best. I think he maybe needs to catch up.

[EugeniaL](https://cargocollective.com/eugenialoli) November 5, 2019 12:38 am 

He’s right in some regards, but wrong in others.

Personally, I don’t like mafia films (neither prison, or war films for that matter). I like dangerous films, but not ones that are filled with humankind’s worst people and the situations that arise from them. I’m more into looking into the future and a more evolved humanity. Which is why I prefer cerebral sci-fi as my favorite genre.

Now, the MCU is not cerebral, but at least is less dark than mafia films, and more fun.

Regarding distribution, he’s right about the situation, but wrong about the roots of the situation. Going to the cinema is now seen as an event, and as such, only tentpoles will be played there. Everything else will be shoved to streaming. Hollywood can’t change that, because it’s what people ultimately want.

Scorsese implies that because Hollywood stifles “dangerous” films, people can’t see them. The reality is different though: Hollywood simply researched the issue (isn’t that what Scorsese said anyway, about Hollywood researching and modifying everything?!?), and found that people have no inclination towards paying for a ticket for “non-fun” films. It’s the truth. In the past, they’d do it because entertainment avenues were few and between. Today, there are big living TVs, streaming, social media, Youtube, and video games. The only way for cinemas to compete is to become more fun. And Hollywood tries to give audience exactly that.

It was never Hollywood’s fault. It’s just society changing. Scorsese and every other filmmaker need to understand that.
