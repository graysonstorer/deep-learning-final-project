Last night at their Comic-Con presentation, Marvel debuted their new logo along with a fanfare by Oscar-winning composer **Michael Giacchino** (_Up_). The logo is a nice way to recognize that Marvel Studios has really come into its own and while I’m a firm believer than production titles shouldn’t be longer than 15 seconds, I’m willing to give Marvel a bit of leeway. Check out the new logo below and get used to it because you’re going to be seeing it front of Marvel movies for a while:

What I like about this logo is that it acknowledges Marvel Studios’ history rather than being an outgrowth of Marvel Comics. The old logo worked at the time, but it made the studio seem like what it was—an outgrowth of the comic division, and it must pay homage to its origins. But after eight years of hits and billions of dollars, Marvel Studios is a heavy hitter in its own right, and they can acknowledge their own history within their logo.

A change in logo is also good because not only are we now in Phase 3, but you may recall that last September, Marvel Studios dissolved its creative group and had president **Kevin Feige** report directly to Disney. So we’re not just in a new era of the MCU; we’re also in a new era for the company, and this new logo feels like a way of acknowledging that.
