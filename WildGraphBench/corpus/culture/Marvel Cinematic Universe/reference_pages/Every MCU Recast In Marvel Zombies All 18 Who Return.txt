# Every MCU Recast In Marvel Zombies (& All 18 Who Return)

While 18 stars reprise their [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://comicbook.com/tag/marvel-cinematic-universe/) roles in the animated _[Marvel Zombies](https://comicbook.com/tag/marvel-zombies-tv/)_ series, there are seven main characters who have instead been recast for new voice actors. _Marvel Zombies_ released all four of its episodes on September 24, 2025, continuing the story that began in [_What If…?_ season 1, episode 5, “What If… Zombies?!”](https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/marvel-zombies-season-2-plan-is-already-waiting-to-go-and-what-it-will-take-for-it-to-happen-exclusive/)_What If…?_ saw Janet van Dyne return from the Quantum Realm in 2018 with a virus that caused a zombie outbreak on Earth, leading to the deaths of millions, including many of the most powerful Avengers.

Picking up five years after the initial outbreak – reminding us of _Avengers: Endgame’s_ Blip – [_Marvel Zombies_ follows various bands of survivors](https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/marvel-zombies-trailer/) trying to find a cure for the virus while going toe-to-toe with the Queen of the Dead, a zombified and formidable Wanda Maximoff. Some of the most exciting new MCU characters returned in _Marvel Zombies_, with many stars on Marvel Studios’ payroll reprising their roles from past live-action projects. Even so, there were seven characters who were recast in _Marvel Zombies_. **Warning: This article contains SPOILERS for _Marvel Zombies_.**

7) Okoye (Kenna Ramsey)
-----------------------

_The Walking Dead_ star [Danai Gurira plays Okoye in the MCU](https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/black-panther-okoye-spinoff-not-moving-forward-brad-winderbaum/) and voiced the Wakandan Dora Milaje general in _What If…?_ season 1, but didn’t return for _Marvel Zombies_. Instead, Kenna Ramsey (_My Adventures with Superman, Kung Fu Panda: The Dragon Knight)_ voiced the zombified Okoye in _Marvel Zombies_ – she lost her life in _What If…?_ – following her voice role as Okoye in _What If…?_ season 3. In _Marvel Zombies_, Okoye was the highest-ranking member of the Red Queen’s army of the dead, issuing commands and signals in Maximoff’s stead.

6) Eric Brooks’ Blade/Moon Knight (Todd Williams)
-------------------------------------------------

Mahershala Ali was announced to be cast as the MCU’s Eric Brooks, the Daywalker known as Blade, in 2019, and he made his first voice cameo appearance at the end of _Eternals_. The [production of the MCU’s _Blade_ reboot](https://comicbook.com/movies/news/marvel-blade-reboot-mcu-timeline-period-piece-sinners-movie/) has been incredibly tumultuous, which has delayed Ali’s live-action debut as the vampire hunter, but his likeness was used for the Moon Knight version of the character in _Marvel Zombies_. This iteration is voiced by Todd Williams (_San Andreas, Invincible)_, and it’s currently unclear when or which version of Blade will next be seen in the MCU.

5) Melina Vostokoff (Kari Wahlgren)
-----------------------------------

![Image 3: Animated still image from a fictional superhero universe, showing a woman in a red light](https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/Melina-Vostokoff-running-in-Marvel-Zombies.jpg?w=1024)
Kari Wahlgren is a MCU veteran when it comes to voice acting. She has voiced various characters in _What If…?, X-Men ’97_, and _Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man_, including Carina, Rose Gilberti, May Parker, and Melina Vostokoff – a role she reprised in _Marvel Zombies_. Melina is the mother figure to Natasha Romanoff and Yelena Belova who is a steadfast hero in _Marvel Zombies_, rather than the Iron Maiden iteration Wahlgren previously voiced in _What If…?_. Vostokoff was played by Rachel Weisz in _Black Widow_, but she hasn’t yet reprised the role in live-action.

4) Xu Wenwu (Feodor Chin)
-------------------------

![Image 4: The Ancient One with dark hair and in blue armor is clutching his fists with glowing blue energy around his arms](https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/Xu-Wenwu-with-the-Ten-Rings-in-What-If.jpg?w=1024)
After voicing Xu Wenwu in two episodes of _What If…?_, Feodor Chin (_Hit-Monkey, Scrambled)_ returned as the real Mandarin and original user of the Ten Rings for a brief moment in _Marvel Zombies_. Originally played by [Tony Leung in _Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings_](https://comicbook.com/movies/news/marvel-iron-man-3-controversy-mandarin-twist-explained-mcu/), Wenwu traveled to San Francisco during the outbreak of the zombie virus with his Ten Rings soldiers to find and protect his son, Shang-Chi. After Shang-Chi was bitten, Wenwu gave up the Ten Rings to save his life, sacrificing himself just as he does in the live-action MCU.

3) Peter Parker’s Spider-Man (Hudson Thames)
--------------------------------------------

![Image 5: Spider-Man is soaring through the air, pursued by a horde of zombies equipped with red laser weapons](https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/Spider-Man-killing-some-zombies-in-Marvel-Zombies.jpg?w=1024)
While Tom Holland has been lauded as perhaps the best actor to portray Peter Parker’s Spider-Man in live-action, he hasn’t voiced the wall-crawling Avenger in Marvel Studios’ animated projects. Instead, it’s [Hudson Thames (_American Soul, Ghosts)_ who returns as the animated Spider-Man](https://comicbook.com/movies/news/hudson-thames-favorite-spider-man-movie-response-reason/), following on from his voice roles in _What If…?_ and _Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man_. Spider-Man was crucial to “What If… Zombies?!,” and continued to be just as important in _Marvel Zombies_, as the rest of his mission to Wakanda with Ant-Man and the Black Panther was explored.

2) Baron Helmut Zemo (Rama Vallury)
-----------------------------------

![Image 6: Evil Doctor Strange Variant from the Marvel Cinematic Universe show What If?, staring menacingly, orange colorized with white eyes](https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/Zemo-looking-shocked-in-Marvel-Zombies.jpg?w=1024)
Following on from his voice role in _X-Men ’97_, Rama Vallury returned in _Marvel Zombies_ as the voice of Baron Helmut Zemo. In _Marvel Zombies_, Zemo is the leader of the City on the Sea – the Raft prison converted into an epic life vessel. Zemo uses the surviving heroes on board in an attempt to distract Namor and the zombified Talokanil, but this didn’t exactly go to plan. Vallury (_Iron Man and His Awesome Friends, The Signal)_ takes over from Daniel Brühl who has played Zemo in live-action in _Captain America: Civil War_ and _The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_.

1) Thor (Greg Furman)
---------------------

![Image 7: Ultron holding his weapon as blue streaks of lightning come from it against a red background](https://comicbook.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/09/Thor-fighting-the-Queen-of-the-Dead-in-Marvel-Zombies.jpg?w=1024)
Chris Hemsworth has played the Asgardian God of Thunder, Thor, throughout almost the entire history of the MCU, and will return in _Avengers: Doomsday_ next year. This makes it curious as to why Hemsworth didn’t return to voice Thor in _Marvel Zombies_. The God of Thunder was instead voiced by Greg Furman (_Waking Up With Strangers, Shifter)_. Thor only had a couple lines in _Marvel Zombies_, and Hemsworth’s schedule might have been too busy to provide the voice for the character, but this recasting could hint at huge changes for [Thor in the MCU’s future](https://comicbook.com/movies/news/chris-hemsworth-thor-mcu-future-post-avengers-doomsday-comments/).
