_Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_ very nearly brought fans one step closer to a unified Marvel movie multiverse.

During a [Facebook live video Q&A;](https://www.facebook.com/jgunn) today,_Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_ director [James Gunn](https://comicbook.com/category/james-gunn)revealed that he nearly included an in-universe shoutout to the _Deadpool_ movie in the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://comicbook.com/category/marvel-cinematic-universe) film.

The moment would have come during [Stan Lee](https://comicbook.com/category/stan-lee)'s cameo in the movie. As is, the cameo reveals that Stan Lee is a single character of cosmic stature who appears across the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In the _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_ cameo scene, Lee specifically references his time as a FedEx employee in _Captain America: Civil War_.

However, Gunn says that wasn't alway the reference Lee made. While filming the scene, Gunn shouted out several of Lee's past cameos for Lee to use for the line, including the time that Lee was a DJ at a strip club, which was how Lee appeared in the _Deadpool_ movie.

Gunn notes that the reference would have been especially fun because it would have acknowledged 20th Century Fox's [X-Men movies](https://comicbook.com/category/x-men-movies) universe. He did not say why that reference wasn't used in the film's final cut, leaving fans to speculate whether Marvel Studios shot the idea down or if it simply wasn't the best version of the scene.
