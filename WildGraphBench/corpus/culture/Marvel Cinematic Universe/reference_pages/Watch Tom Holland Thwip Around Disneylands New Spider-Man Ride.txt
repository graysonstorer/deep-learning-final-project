Get your spider-pose game ready for...sometime this year, hopefully?

Considering he’s in it, it’s probably only fair that Tom Holland gets to ride the [new Spider-Man ride](https://io9.gizmodo.com/a-robotic-swinging-spider-man-is-coming-to-disneyland-t-1841362485) at Disney California Adventure way, way before the rest of us actually will at this point.

In a parallel world where the world was slightly less miserable than it actually was last year, anyone going to Disneyland California Adventure starting in [July last year](https://io9.gizmodo.com/disneys-avengers-campus-will-open-in-july-unless-it-do-1842267376) could’ve already had the chance to ride _Web Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure_, the centerpiece ride at the park’s [brand new MCU-themed area](https://io9.gizmodo.com/everything-we-just-learned-about-avengers-campus-disne-1837451242), Avengers Campus. Instead, you got no theme park ride and the chance to catch a highly infectious disease, so, womp womp!

[###### Disney's Avengers Campus Will Open in July (Unless It Doesn't)](https://io9.gizmodo.com/disneys-avengers-campus-will-open-in-july-unless-it-do-1842267376)
Disney has set an opening date for its Marvel park experience at Disney’s California Adventure,…

But while you wait for vaccinations and for Avengers Campus to actually open at some point, Disney has released a new video to whet your appetite for [livin’ on the edge, fighting crime, and spinning webs](https://io9.gizmodo.com/spider-mans-best-cartoons-ranked-1845836830) in a theme-park-based environment. Going behind-the-scenes as actor Tom Holland reprises his role as Peter Parker for the ride, you get a glimpse of the actor being suitably flustered against a green screen, _and_ a few looks at the ride itself in action.

In the story of Avengers Campus, Peter has set up W.E.B. (the Worldwide Engineers Brigade), hoping to step into his father figure Tony Stark’s shoes and inspire a new generation of geniuses to use technology to save the world, because that worked so well the last few times in Marvel movies. Anyway, _Web Slingers_ will see riders cast as budding new members of the initiative that see themselves flung into action when [the new Spider-Bots](https://io9.gizmodo.com/the-cutest-weirdest-toy-of-the-week-is-a-spider-drone-1845743711) Peter’s developed start going haywire, leading to Spider-Man recruiting you all as temporary webslingers to contain the rampaging drones.

It all looks very cute, even if we don’t have a clue just _when_ we’ll actually get to experience it ourselves at this point. While Disneyland currently does have a potential [road to re-opening](https://io9.gizmodo.com/disneyland-finally-has-a-path-to-reopening-but-its-not-1845425866) under California’s current covid-19 guidelines, it’s a long way off from actually doing so, and that doesn’t necessarily mean Avengers Campus will be open from the get-go either. Right now, the park’s better suited [to distribute vaccines](https://io9.gizmodo.com/disneyland-will-become-a-covid-19-vaccination-site-1846041099) than it is play host to a bunch of budding spider-wannabes, anyway.

Hey.

Disney.

W.E.B. is a legit good idea. Make that in reality, k? At the worst, it’ll be great for PR.
