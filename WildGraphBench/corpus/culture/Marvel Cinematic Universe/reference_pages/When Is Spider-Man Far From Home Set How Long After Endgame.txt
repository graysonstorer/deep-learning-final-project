**Warning! [Contains MAJOR SPOILERS for _Spider-Man: Far From Home_](https://screenrant.com/spiderman-far-home-movie-spoilers/).**

_**[Spider-Man: Far From Home](https://screenrant.com/tag/spider-man-homecoming-2/)**_ deals with the aftermath of Thanos (Josh Brolin) defeat and Iron Man's (Robert Downey Jr.) death, but how long has it been in the film since the events of _[Avengers: Endgame](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers-4/)_? Directed by Jon Watts, the latest Marvel Studios blockbuster brings Peter Parker to Europe for a much-needed vacation after [The Blip (aka Thanos' snap)](https://screenrant.com/spiderman-far-home-thanos-snap-name-blip/). But his trip goes awry after an unexpected mission call from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) comes up resulting in him teaming-up and eventually battling [Quentin Beck/Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal)](https://screenrant.com/mysterio-dead-alive-spiderman-far-home-ending/).

MCU's [Spider-Man movie franchise](https://screenrant.com/spider-man-movies-ranked/) isn't really the best barometer when it comes to gauging the MCU's timeline. _[Spider-Man: Homecoming](https://screenrant.com/tag/spider-man-homecoming/)_ famously botched its "eight years later" time-jump from the Battle of New York when it should've just been six. Since then, Marvel Studios has admitted that it's a detail slip on their part. Coming from that mishap, however, _Far From Home_ has to deal with a much more complicated [timeline due to _Endgame_'s five-year time jump](https://screenrant.com/avengers-endgame-marvel-movie-timeline-problem-2023/), not to mention the age difference between those who were affected by Thanos' snap and those who weren't.

As the first step towards a post-_Endgame_ MCU, it's important to establish when _Spider-Man:Far From Home_ takes place. And while the film didn't explicitly say when it's set, there are several clues in the movie that will give us an idea on where it fits in the MCU timeline. It seems, **_Spider-Man: Far From Home_ takes place in the summer of 2024, eight months after _Avengers: Endgame_.**

![Image 5](https://screenrant.com/spiderman-far-home-year-set-after-avengers-endgame/)

Initially, [_Far From Home_ was said to begin minutes after _Endgame_](https://screenrant.com/spider-man-homecoming-sequel-avengers-4-timeline/), but it doesn't seem to be that way. That doesn't mean, however, that it has taken that long either considering that the world continues to mourn the loss of Tony Stark, as evidenced in various shrines dedicated to the hero in the movie.Right off the bat, during the film's cold open, Betty (Angourie Rice) talks about how The Blip played out and how it impacted the lives of those who were disintegrated into dust.

Apparently, the school year 2023/2024 is just coming to an end and those who were snuffed out of existence were forced to retake the whole year despite having already finished mid-terms five years prior. The Midtown Tech newscast also revealed that it's been exactly eight months after the events of _Endgame_.With that in mind,and [_Endgame_'s final battle](https://screenrant.com/avengers-endgame-every-character-spoiler/) leading to the death of Iron Man taking place on the fall of 2023, _Far From Home_ is set in the summer of 2024, around June or July.

That means that the current MCU timeline is up until the middle of 2024 at this point, and depending on what's next on their slate, it can stay like that for a while. Upcoming films like Cate Shortland's _[Black Widow](https://screenrant.com/tag/black-widow/)_ starring Scarlett Johansson (which is already in production) and Chloe Zhao's _[The Eternals](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-eternals/)_ - both of which are expected to hit theaters next year - are believed to be prequel films, tackling events before The Blip. That allows Marvel Studios to continue producing movies without having to deal with the ramifications of the [end of _**Spider-Man:Far From Home**_](https://screenrant.com/spiderman-far-home-movie-ending-explained/)- specifically, the [reveal of Spider-Man's true identity in the credits scene](https://screenrant.com/spiderman-far-home-end-credits-scenes-explained-jameson-skrulls/) - at least for now.
