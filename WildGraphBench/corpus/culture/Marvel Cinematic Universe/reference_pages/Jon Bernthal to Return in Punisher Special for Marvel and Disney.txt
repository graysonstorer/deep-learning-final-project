Bernthal first played the grieving father-turned-vigilante on [Netflix](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/netflix/)’s version of _Daredevil_, debuting the character during 2016’s second season. He went on to headline his own series for Netflix, playing the titular character for two seasons of _The Punisher,_ which spanned 2017 to 2019.

News of the _Punisher_ special marks Bernthal, _[The Walking Dead](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/walking-dead/)_ alum, continuing to collaborate with Marvel.

In September 2023,_Daredevil: Born Again_ hit the[reset](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/daredevil-marvel-disney-1235614518/)button and overhauled its planned 18-episode series after early footage failed to meet Marvel Studios’ expectations.

In a [2016 interview](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/daredevil-jon-bernthal-punisher-876322/) with _THR_, Bernthal spoke about debuting the character and what it meant to Marvel Comics fans. He introduced the iconic comic character in the season-two premiere of Netflix’s _Daredevil_. When Hell’s Kitchen becomes ground zero for what seems like an army waging a war on gangs using military-grade firepower, Matt Murdock (Charlie Cox) soon finds out that it’s actually only one man seeking out a personal vendetta. In the opener, Matt suits up as Daredevil to find and take down the man the city has nicknamed the Punisher— but he quickly learns that he may have met his match.

“The Punisher means so much to so many people, and it lives in so many different people’s heads, so they care about it so much,” he said. “That’s huge to me, and I understand it. I’m familiar with the comic book audience from my time on _The Walking Dead_: They’re very intelligent, loyal and passionate. This character also resonates deeply with law enforcement and military. People go into battle for our country with the Punisher logo on their equipment, their body armor, their vehicles, and they die for their country with that logo on them.”
