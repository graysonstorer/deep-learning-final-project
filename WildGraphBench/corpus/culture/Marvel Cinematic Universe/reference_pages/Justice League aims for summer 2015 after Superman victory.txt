![Image 7: Captain America Winter Soldier Concept Header](http://bitcast-a-sm.bitgravity.com/slashfilm/wp/wp-content/images/Captain-America-Winter-Soldier-Concept-Header.jpg)

When aliens invade New York and a team of superheroes comes out of nowhere to defeat them, the world is going change quite a bit. This global fallout to events in Marvel’s _The Avengers_ has been referenced in _Iron Man 3, Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ and even the trailer to _Thor: The Dark World_. The film after that, **_Captain America: The Winter Soldier_**, will certainly deal with a similar landscape too, especially since it features S.H.I.E.L.D., the agency at the center of _The Avengers_.

But where do all these films fall on the timeline?_Iron Man 3_ takes places six months after _The Avengers, Thor: The Dark World_ is rumored to take place about year after and _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ is likely somewhere in between (Extremis baddies, anyone?). That leaves _The Winter Soldier_ and, according to co-star**Scarlett Johansson**, the film takes place two years after _The Avengers_, suggesting much more will have change after _Iron Man 3_ and _Thor 2_.

Johansson said the following in an interview with[Refinery 29](http://www.refinery29.com/2013/09/54387/scarlett-johansson-don-jon-interview)(via [MTV](http://splashpage.mtv.com/2013/09/30/captain-america-the-winter-soldier-scarlett-johansson-real-time/)):

> This film is in real time. It’s been two years since [the characters] appeared, and now both are agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. fighting in the streets. We are not superheroes flying side by side. They help each other because we are fighting in a similar way. It’s a working relationship.

By “real time,” I don’t think she means minute by minute like _24_. She likely means _The Avengers_ was released in May 2012 and _Cap 2_ will be released in April 2014. Two years. Real time.

She continued by teasing more about Black Widow’s relationship with Cap:

> By a series of unfortunate encounters, they will be in a situation in which their friendship becomes more intimate. They share many similarities because they live on the defensive without relying on anyone. Also, the two have been working for the government throughout their professional careers. With their friendship they begin to question what they want and what is their true identity.

Besides the development of that relationship, how do you think the events of the other Phase Two movies will influence _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_? Also, how much time do you estimate elapses between _Cap 2_ and _Avengers: Age of Ultron_? (My guess? Not much.) Does a two year gap ruin some logic as to why _The Avengers_ don’t appear in _Iron Man 3_?
