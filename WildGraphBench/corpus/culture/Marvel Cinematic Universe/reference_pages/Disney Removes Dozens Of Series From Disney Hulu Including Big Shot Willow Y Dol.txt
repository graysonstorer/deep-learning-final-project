**UPDATED with more titles being removed:**[Disney](https://deadline.com/tag/disney/)is starting to pull content from streaming, with dozens of series and specials slated to leave [Disney+](https://deadline.com/tag/disney-2/) and [Hulu](https://deadline.com/tag/hulu/) on May 26, Deadline has learned. The titles, which are being removed from Disney’s streaming services globally, include Disney+’s _[Willow](https://deadline.com/tag/willow/), Big Shot, Turner & Hooch, The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers, Just Beyond_, _Diary of a Future President_, _The Mysterious Benedict Society_ and _The World According to Jeff Goldblum_ and Hulu’s _[Y: The Last Man](https://deadline.com/tag/y-the-last-man/), Dollface, The Hot Zone, Maggie, Pistol_ and _Little Demon._ A number of Freeform series also are slated to leave Hulu.

The move, which comes with a content impairment charge of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, [was announced during the recent Disney earnings call on May 10.](https://deadline.com/2023/05/disney-plus-loses-subscribers-streaming-quarter-bob-iger-1235362109/)

“We are in the process of reviewing the content on our DTC services to align with the strategic changes in our approach to content curation,” CFO Christine McCarthy said. At the time, no details were provided on the content that would be removed.

Disney is the latest media company to purge content from its streaming platforms in a cost-cutting measure as the industry is rethinking costs and strategy in that arena with a renewed focus on profitability. Warner Bros. Discovery [removed a slew of series from HBO Max](https://deadline.com/2022/12/raised-by-wolves-the-time-travelers-wife-among-other-titles-being-removed-from-hbo-max-as-warner-bros-discovery-lines-up-fast-plans-1235199433/), with AMC and Showtime also undergoing a similar scale back.

For more insight into the issue, read Deadline’s [The Streaming Purge: Behind The Wave Of Library Content Removals & Its Impact On The Creative Community](https://deadline.com/2023/02/the-streaming-purge-library-content-removals-impact-creative-community-1235256840/), which predicted the current Disney program cuts.

Below is a list of some of the titles that are being removed from Disney+ and Hulu:

**UPDATE FRIDAY**: _Howar_ d [will not be removed](https://deadline.com/2023/05/disney-backlash-removal-howard-documentary-little-mermaid-lgbtq-1235373329/) from Disney+. The documentary about famous _Little Mermaid_ lyricist Howard Ashman was on the original list of titles set to be pulled May 26 that Disney had sent out to partners. The list is being reevaluated, and there could be additional changes, a rep for Disney said.

**2nd UPDATE**: As the list is being finalized, several other Disney+ titles that had been earmarked for removal are staying on, _A Spark Story, Marvel’s MPower_ and _Marvel’s Voices Rising: The Music of Wakanda Forever._ The roster below has been updated to reflect that.

 They’re pulling them because they don’t want to pay the writers their residuals while they are on strike. [Reply Reply to Shrug](https://deadline.com/2023/05/disney-remove-series-streaming-disney-plus-hulu-big-shot-willow-y-dollface-turner-hooch-pistol-1235372512/?replytocom=3738101#respond)

 And here we are, we’ve lost all the power.

 Really missing video rental stores now?

 How’s paying six to eight dollars to rent a new release?

*    Amber  on May 20, 2023 5:47 am  Just because you like something doesn’t make it popular or worth keeping on a streaming service if not enough people are watching. I learned this the hard way with movies that I really enjoyed only to learn later that other people hated it, the reviews are bad or they tanked at the box office. You can’t always blame everything on some sort of movement, sometimes the reason is simpler, such as not enough viewers. Why do you think shows on TV used to get canceled..not enough viewers.

*    Once Loyal Streamer  on May 19, 2023 6:44 pm  This is so stupid. I thought the whole point of making original content specific to the platform meant that content would always be available with your subscription. What is the point of a movie or series being a “Hulu Original” or a “Disney + Original” if they are not going to always be accessible on those platforms? Why are they being removed? Content that was paid for and produced by and for those networks and platforms. First HBO dumps Westworld, so it’s no longer viewable, even with a subscription, and now other networks are doing it.

    *    dave  on May 20, 2023 5:47 am  This is due to residuals. For every year it stays on a streaming service it counts as a re-air, which requires paying a lot of royalties. [Reply Reply to dave](https://deadline.com/2023/05/disney-remove-series-streaming-disney-plus-hulu-big-shot-willow-y-dollface-turner-hooch-pistol-1235372512/?replytocom=3737266#respond)  

*    KM  on May 19, 2023 6:38 pm  I think it’s stupid that they put so much money into original content that is featured as “hulu original” or “Disney + original” and yet not even keep them on the platform that they were created by and for. I always expected that you could expect to have access to original content created on those platforms if you paid to subscribe to them. That way I could always watch or re-watch Willow or Dollface or the underrated Encore!. Just like I thought subscribing to HBO would always allow access to Westworld. How do you remove access to content that was original to the platform?

*    Kris  on May 19, 2023 4:59 pm  Ridiculous and greedy. The whole point of streaming was to be able to watch stuff whenever you wanted, now they’re continually taking stuff off so they don’t have to pay people. It really sucks for everyone involved and for fans, or would-be fans. Three of these are on my watchlist, so I guess I gotta binge them so people at least get paid residuals. Horrible of them to only give people a week to watch them too.

*    Anonymous  on May 19, 2023 4:13 pm  It’s amazing how a lot of these shows and movies have only debuted in the past year or two, and were streaming exclusives that were meant to add value to the platforms.

Obviously there is so much content generally these days, but not a good sign how a lot of content developed/produced didn’t catch on nor was so enticing to their respective audiences.

*    Anonymous  on May 19, 2023 12:30 pm  This is about content amortization, since the cost of a show or film is spread out over years. taking it off the service means they can write off the cost and no longer pay into the future.

    *    Anonymous  on May 19, 2023 2:33 pm  This is about streaming services not wanting said service to be overwhelmed with junk nobody watches.

Better to have a smaller selection that is high quality and/or gets watched a lot than a sea of unwatched junk that requires (especially new) users to scroll endlessly to find the good stuff.

*    ARC2  on May 19, 2023 11:44 am  I’m sure this is going to be an unpopular opinion, whatever. Except for one show in the above list, I’m not disappointed. The new Willow was horrible. IMHO – the writers these days are equally horrible. I miss good shows due to good writing. These days it’s throwing anything together and throwing it at the audience. At the rate Disney and Netflix are going, I’ll soon be canceling their streaming services. I refuse to pay more while getting less, especially in the category of fantasy.

*    Support the WGA  on May 19, 2023 11:10 am  Making a real case to bring back DVD/Blu Ray in a bigger way? I’m not a number cruncher, but it seems like it would serve both consumer and company for revenue stream. It would also be a good faith move to fans of these shows so they could still view them. Companies could make deals with big box stores to carry them. I have no idea if pop culture would re-adopt dvd, but with all these streaming cancellations maybe it should be considered. The split on DVD profits was always net profit for the studios by a huge margin.

    *    Anonymous  on May 19, 2023 1:19 pm  They never went anywhere. People continue to buy dvds and Blu-rays. They’re doing it less and less every year making it cost-benefit negative for most distribs.

 For all the physical media hype, it’s still a shrinking dying industry with even more concentration (meaning less titles sell the bulk of discs) than theatrical.

 Didn’t you read that 1/4 of all vinyl records sold in 2022 were Taylor Swift?? You can’t call an industry “thriving” when it’s that dependent on individual releases. And I say this as a collector who clearly sees value in physical media. Demand just isn’t there.

*    Anonymous  on May 19, 2023 10:40 am  They are doing this as a scare tactic during the WGA strike. They’re removing the shows/movies so no one can stream them so they don’t have to pay residuals to the writers.
