Samuel L. Jackson let slip a secret role in _[Secret Invasion](https://web.archive.org/web/20220312210958/https://comicbook.com/category/secret-invasion/)_: [Martin Freeman](https://web.archive.org/web/20220312210958/https://comicbook.com/category/martin-freeman-actor/)'s CIA Agent [Everett Ross](https://web.archive.org/web/20220312210958/https://comicbook.com/category/everett-ross/). According to Jackson, Freeman will appear in the Marvel Studios series reuniting Jackson's [super-spy Nick Fury](https://web.archive.org/web/20220312210958/https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/secret-invasion-spoilers-set-photos-ben-mendelsohn-cobie-smulders/) with the Skrull Talos (_Captain Marvel_'s Ben Mendelsohn) and Maria Hill (_The Avengers_' Cobie Smulders). The _Sherlock_ actor joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2016's _Captain America: Civil War,_ playing a handler for the Joint Terrorism Task Force,and later [reprised his role](https://web.archive.org/web/20220312210958/https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/black-panther-wakanda-forever-star-martin-freeman-has-a-new-look-full-beard-set-photo/) as Agent Ross in 2018's _Black Panther._ Freeman returns in _Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,_ set to open in theaters this November.

Jackson identified Freeman as a cast member during a live appearance at the _Samuel L. Jackson: In Conversation With Josh Horowitz_ event in New York City. The Disney+ streaming series has also cast Emilia Clarke (_Game of Thrones_), Olivia Colman (_The Crown_), Christopher McDonald (_Ballers_), Carmen Ejogo (_True Detective_), and Kingsley Ben-Adir (_The OA_) in undisclosed roles.

"How amazing is that? Martin Freeman. Come on. When I walked in the room and Olivia Colman was standing there, I was just like, [excited]," Jackson said of his _Secret Invasion_ co-stars in a video snippet of the conversation posted to Twitter. "We just started laughing, and when we started to work, it was so glorious and such a ball. We were just kind of having a good time. She is so amazing and so effective in a scene."

"It's those moments that, when you're in the middle of doing it and you feel it and you watch it happen, that when they finally say 'cut,' you look at the other person and go, 'Oh my god, that was amazing,'" Jackson continued of the Emmy and Oscar-winning actress. "She was great."

Inspired by the Marvel Comics event of the same name,_Secret Invasion_ grips the Marvel universe in paranoia when it's discovered shape-shifting invaders have infiltrated all facets of life on Earth. MCU first-timers Thomas Bezucha (_The Family Stone, Let Him Go_) and Ali Selim (_Criminal Minds, Manhunt_) direct the series coming to Disney+. A release date is TBA.
