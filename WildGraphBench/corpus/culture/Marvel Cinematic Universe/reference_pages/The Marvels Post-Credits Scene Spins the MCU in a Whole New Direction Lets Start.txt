A lot is riding on _The Marvels_. Arriving as Marvel’s decidedly up (_Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3., Loki_) and down (_Secret Invasion, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania_, [that instantly-infamous Variety cover story](https://web.archive.org/web/20231108200413/https://www.gq.com/story/with-its-kang-phase-in-peril-marvel-reportedly-considers-an-outside-the-box-idea-robert-downey-jr-as-iron-man)) year continues, the sequel to the Brie Larson-fronted _Captain Marvel_ assembles a new team of heroes in the form of [Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris)](https://web.archive.org/web/20231108200413/https://www.gq.com/story/teyonah-parris-wandavision-monica-rambeau-interview) and Kamala Khan (Iman Vellani) alongside Larson’s Carol Danvers as they team up to face an intergalactic threat in the form of Kree extremist Dar-Benn (Zawe Ashton).

**Major, Major Spoiler Alert Below**

Only Dar-Benn isn’t the real threat. _The Marvels_ features the first on-screen appearance of an incursion event—a long-teased multiversal calamity that will play a critical part in the future of the MCU and its Multiverse Saga moving forward. But that’s not all: _The Marvels_' post-credits sequence deploys a pretty wild cameo to foreshadow what's next for the MCU.

To help you understand it all, let's walk through the lore, the key players involved, and what it means for the future of the MCU.

**What happens in _The Marvels_' post-credits scene?**

Monica wakes up and meets a version of her mother, Maria (Lashana Lynch.) You may remember Maria from _Captain Marvel_; later, during the _Wandavision_ TV series, we found out that she died of cancer sometime after [The Snap](https://web.archive.org/web/20231108200413/https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Snap), which meant Monica (one of many MCU characters who got temporarily Snapped out of existence) wasn't around to say goodbye to her. So this isn't the Maria we know. As Monica rightly begins to freak out, this version of Maria ([going by the name Binary, with a costume to match](https://web.archive.org/web/20231108200413/https://www.marvel.com/amp/articles/comics/witness-the-explosive-power-of-binary-in-the-next-arc-of-captain-marvel)) makes it clear she has no idea who Monica is—and then Beast walks in the door.

Yes, Beast-- as played by Kelsey Grammer, most recently in 2014's _X-Men: Days of Future Past._ That film's comparatively lavish Beast makeup effects have been replaced here by some spotty CGI, but this version of Beast (lab coat, glasses, no shirt) looks enough like the [_X-Men: The Animated Series_ version of the character](https://web.archive.org/web/20231108200413/https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/marvelanimated/images/6/6b/Beast.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20160425013134) to fire all those 90s-nostalgia pleasure centers. It’s unclear whether or not this is supposed to be the same Beast audiences last saw in _Days of Future Past_, but the production design of the room in the background is strikingly similar to the blue-gray-toned look and feel of the Fox _X-Men_ franchise—which is evidently now a canonical part of MCU continuity for the very first time.

**Wait. What?**

Yeah, we know.

**I’m sorry. That’s a lot to unpack.**

It’s actually quite simple.

**Alright then. First things first: What’s an incursion?**

The first mention of an incursion in the MCU came in the midst of an exposition dump by John Krasinski’s Reed Richards in 2022's _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_. An Incursion event occurs “when the boundary between two universes erodes, they collide… destroying one, or both, entirely.” Clea (played by Charlize Theron) shows up in the post-credits of _Multiverse_ to tell Strange that his actions throughout the course of that film have triggered an incursion—and that the two of them are going to fix it.

Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors) also mentions incursions in passing during _Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania._ To fully drive home the point, Beast tells Maria that scans show she’s not from their reality, stating, “You are now in a reality parallel to your own.” _The Marvels_ might be the first time audiences see an incursion, but it likely won’t be the last.

**Why won’t it be the last?**

Let’s touch on that in a second. Ask me something else.

**Okay then. What’s up with Frasier coming back?**

The appearance of Grammer’s Beast in _The Marvels_' post-credits scene is directly teeing up next spring's _Deadpool 3_, which is looking more and more like a film in which (as rumored) [Ryan Reynolds’ Merc With a Mouth will kill off the entire Fox Universe of Marvel characters](https://web.archive.org/web/20231108200413/https://www.gq.com/story/deadpool-3-ryan-reynolds-hugh-jackman-wolverine-jennifer-garner-elektra-everything-we-know) as an aperitif to 2027's _Avengers: Secret Wars_, the forthcoming sequel to 2026's even-more-forthcoming _Avengers: The Kang Dynasty_. Beast mentions that “Charles” wants an update, so maybe there’s also a chance audiences will see Patrick Stewart's Professor X again after his cameo in _Multiverse of Madness_.

**Why won’t this be the last incursion? Is this leading to something?**

It is, indeed: [the previously announced _Secret Wars_](https://web.archive.org/web/20231108200413/https://www.gq.com/story/marvel-mcu-comic-con-2022-black-panther-wakanda-forever-trailer-avengers-secret-wars-kang-daredevil).

It feels more and more likely that the MCU's next Phase will take its cues from the 2015 comic-book crossover event _Secret Wars_ and the storylines that led up to it. In those comics—written by Jonathan Hickman, with art by Esad Ribic—a secret team of Marvel heroes, including Beast, Black Bolt, Doctor Strange, Iron Man, Mr. Fantastic, and Namor, discover that incursions are happening in the main Marvel comic book universe, known as the 616 universe. The incursions increase until the two main Marvel Comics Universes, 616 and the Ultimate universe—a modern-day retelling of Marvel lore, where Miles Morales first appeared—collide, creating a new, patchwork reality.

Since the MCU doesn’t have an Ultimate universe to draw from, perhaps the primary Marvel universe colliding with the Fox universe of characters will be what sets the foundation for the cinematic version of _Secret Wars_ — or maybe it’ll be something else that happens in _Kang Dynasty_ since that appears, for now, to be the lead into _Secret Wars_.

Either way, after a few years without a clear overarching storyline, the MCU is finally kicking the Multiverse Saga into high gear. Expect things to get more and more multiversal as we get closer and closer to the release of _Secret Wars_.
