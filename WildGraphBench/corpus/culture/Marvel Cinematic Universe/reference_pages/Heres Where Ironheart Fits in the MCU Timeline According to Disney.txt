Marvel fans are trying to figure out **where [Ironheart](https://www.superherohype.com/tag/ironheart) fits in the official MCU timeline**. In [the first three episodes of the show](https://www.superherohype.com/tv/607503-ironheart-episodes-1-3-review-mcu-show-is-too-much-too-late), there hasn’t been a calendar or anything telling us when it takes place. That said, we’ve had [some statements from the showrunners](https://www.superherohype.com/tv/607322-ironheart-mcu-timeline-placement-revealed-for-disney-show) on its proper placement on the timeline. Fortunately, Disney+ has finally put the matter to rest, at least when it comes to which Marvel movies come before and after the new series starring Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne). Through some deduction, we can work out what season and what month Ironheart most likely takes place.

When does Ironheart take place in the official Marvel timeline?
---------------------------------------------------------------

It’s suggested that Ironheart most likely takes place somewhere in the middle of October 2025, given that the series is situated between the movies Thor: Love and Thunder and Werewolf by Night.

![Image 3: The image shows the MCU Complete Timeline of different marvel movies, including Ms. Marvel, Thor Love and Thunder, Ironheart, and Werewolf by Night](https://www.superherohype.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2025/06/where-ironheart-fits-when-take-place-mcu-timeline-marvel-disney-plus.jpg?w=1024)
According to Disney+, which has a category specifically named “MCU Complete Timeline,” Ironheart comes after Miss Marvel and the 2022 Thor movie. The official timeline book reveals that Miss Marvel occurs somewhere between September and October 2025, while Thor: Love and Thunder also takes place around the same time in October 2025.

Meanwhile, Werewolf by Night clearly occurs around Halloween during the same year, so we can estimate that Ironheart has to be squarely in October too. This timeline, without any mention of Ironheart, is also duplicated on [Marvel’s page on the MCU timeline](https://www.marvel.com/articles/movies/mcu-timeline-order-disney-plus).

This placement fits with what Ironheart producers Sev Ohanian and Zoie Nagelhout have already said. Nagelhout revealed that the series occurs “between six months to a year after Wakanda Forever” while Ohanian was more precise, saying that it is indeed “six months” after the movie. Since Disney+ suggests that the 2022 Black Panther movie takes place in Spring or Summer 2025, this all fits with the existing timeline.

The October 2025 date for Ironheart may be a surprise given that some of the latest Marvel movies, like Thunderbolts*, happens in 2027 on the MCU timeline. But the filming for the show took place in May 2022 before it was delayed. At any rate, the mix of technology and magic in the series is expected to be a primer for Avengers: Doomsday, which is set to release in December 2026.
