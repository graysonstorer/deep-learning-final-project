Agents of SHIELD

_Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._'s Aug 12series finale will mark the final appearance of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) fan favorite character Agent Phil Coulson. Actor Clark Gregg paid tribute to the character he's played for more than a decade and his fans in a short video message released on Marvel Entertainment's YouTube channel.

Agent Coulson was created specially for the MCU making his first appearance in 2008's _Iron Man_, going on to appear in _Iron Man 2_, _Thor_, _The Avengers_ and most recently [_Captain Marvel_](https://gamerant.com/captain-marvel-2-gains-candymans-nia-dacosta-director/). Once a minor supporting character, Gregg made Coulson so popular the Agent has since appeared in the Ultimate Spider-man cartoon, several different comic books, and two Marvel One-Shots: _The Consultant_ and _A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer_. But it was in spinoff TV series _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ where Agent Coulson really came into his own as he led a new team defending the Earth from invasion.

Speaking about his time on the show, Clark said "this team, this evolving team, took a heroic attitude which was to care about nothing but continual evolution. Out of that we built a family and Phil Coulson’s been at the center of that family. ...If you would have told me as I sipped coffee _on Iron Man 1_ that I would go this many layers into this character, it’s really bittersweet to let that journey go, but I can only be grateful for it. So, thank you, on behalf of myself and the team, for giving us this incredible journey."

Initially _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ had close ties to the MCU movies with season 2 being impacted by events in _Avengers: Age of Ultron_. But as the show went on it focused more on its own characters, [something which stars say was for the better,](https://screenrant.com/agents-shield-better-less-mcu-connections/)even bringing Ghost Rider into the MCU during its fourth season. The upcoming 2-hour finale will bring an end to the series after 7 seasons at ABC, after which all 134 episodes will be available on Disney+.

The _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ series finale will air on Aug 12.
