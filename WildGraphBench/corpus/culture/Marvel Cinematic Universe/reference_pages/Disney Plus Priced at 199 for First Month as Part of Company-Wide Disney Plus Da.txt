The Walt [Disney](https://variety.com/t/disney/) Co. has enlisted just about every part of the company for [Disney Plus](https://variety.com/t/disney-plus/) Day — which is actually a weeklong series of promotions, events and content premieres. It’s ultimately aimed, of course, at driving up paying subscribers for the global streaming service.

Among the deals: Starting Monday (Nov. 8) through Sunday, Nov. 14, new and eligible returning Disney Plus subscribers can get one month of the service for $1.99 (available in the U.S. and select countries). After the first month, the service goes back to the regular price ($7.99/month in the U.S.) The media conglom is launching a new hub (at [disneyplus.com/disneyplusday](https://www.disneyplus.com/DisneyPlusDay)) where those who qualify for the offer can sign up and find info on other Disney Plus Day events and promotions.

As of July 3, [Disney Plus had 116 million subscribers worldwide](https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/disney-plus-tops-expectations-reaches-116-million-subscribers-1235040516/) — and the Mouse House is hoping Disney Plus Day, marking the two-year anniversary of its first launch, will crank up direct-to-consumer numbers. Disney is scheduled to report earnings for its fiscal Q4 2021 on Nov. 10; CEO Bob Chapek previously said the company expected [Disney Plus subscriber growth to slow in the September quarter](https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/disney-plus-slowdown-q4-subscribers-bob-chapek-1235070370/).
