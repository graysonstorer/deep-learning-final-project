Two years ago, we all fell in love with Darryl—Thor’s roommate and co-star in a [pair of short films](https://io9.gizmodo.com/thor-continues-being-a-terrible-roommate-in-this-first-1792345280) directed by Taika Waititi that simultaneously showed us what _Thor: Ragnarok_ could be, and explained why Thor wasn’t in _Captain America: Civil War_.

Well, now Darryl is back.

Disney just officially announced a new short film extra on the _Thor: Ragnarok_ Blu-ray called “Team Darryl.” Here’s the description from the press release:

> Fresh off being unseated as the ruler of Sakaar, the Grandmaster makes his way to Earth to start a new life. It’s been over a year since Thor left Australia and Darryl has been struggling to pay his rent. Now Darryl needs a new roommate to help make the monthly payments. Unfortunately for Darryl, the Grandmaster was the only one who answered Darryl’s “Roommate Needed” ad and with no viable options, the Grandmaster moves in.

Yes! Darryl, played by Australian actor Daley Pearson, will be living with the none other than Jeff Goldblum’s Grandmaster. However, if you’ve been paying attention, you probably already knew this.

[Back in October](https://io9.gizmodo.com/jeff-goldblum-is-already-teasing-a-delightful-future-fo-1819875469#_ga=2.142955708.827738659.1515369908-1781268782.1460065920), Goldblum was asked about returning to the role and said the following to the _Radio Times_.

> I shot a thing with Taika, where there’s a roommate in Australia. I show up at his [apartment], and I do knock on his door. And I take up residence in the little flat, as they say here. That’s what I do. And order things from the takeaway restaurant. Buy all the local foods.

Looks like the roommate, we rightfully guessed at the time, turned out to be Darryl. We can’t wait to see the finished product.

Beyond that, the Blu-ray has an impressive list of special features, including lots of additional tongue-in-cheek documentaries, deleted scenes, a director commentary, and more. It’ll be available March 6, and the film comes to digital formats on February 20.
