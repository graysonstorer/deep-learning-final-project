Disney+

[Marvel Studios](https://deadline.com/tag/marvel-studios/) is developing a spinoff of [Emmy-winning](https://deadline.com/2021/09/wandavision-wins-first-emmys-for-marvel-studios-1234831339/)_[WandaVision](https://deadline.com/tag/wandavision/)_ for Disney+, sources confirm to Deadline. The potential spinoff would center on [Kathryn Hahn](https://deadline.com/tag/kathryn-hahn/)’s Agatha Harkness character, which Hahn is set to reprise across the MCU — on streaming and in movies — under a larger deal she has made with the studio, sources said.

_Wandavision_ is a genre-bending series created for Disney+ by Jac Schaeffer, which picks up weeks after the events of _Avengers: Endgame._ It centers on Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany), two superpowered beings living their ideal suburban lives in the town of Westview, NJ, who begin to suspect that everything is not as it seems. Hahn’s Agatha Harkness, a witch from Salem, was a fan-favorite breakout character, earning the actress her [second career Emmy nomination](https://deadline.com/2021/07/2021-emmy-nominations-list-1234791599/) to date (her first was for _Transparent_).

Schaeffer would serve as writer and executive producer on the Harkness spinoff, which was first reported by Deadline’s sister pub Variety. Schaeffer is under a joint overall deal with Marvel and 20th Television.

Hahn is repped by Gersh, Lighthouse Management & Media and Schreck Rose Dapello.

*    Official Disney Spokesman  on October 7, 2021 12:27 pm  Kathryn should be given a new character to do Agatha’s story is finished Wanda turned Agatha back into the mousy nosy neighbor housewife where she will remain trapped in the small town forever no longer the powerful witch she was. To now change that perfect ending to give Agatha a new story arc is stupid. Kathryn is talented enough to play any character if her reps were smart they’d demand that be done for her. Obviously her reps are not smart enough to make this happen for her so she’s stuck playing Agatha.

### Do Not Sell My Personal Information

This page enables California residents to opt-out of sharing of information that may be a sale of personal information under the CCPA. Please review all of your choices below. You can also review our [Privacy Policy.](https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#california)

**Contact Information & Subscription Information**

 We sell or license certain information, such as contact information or subscription information, to third parties to provide you with offers and promotions and opportunities that may be of interest to you. If you would like to opt out of the sale of this information, please use this [webform](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/e65b3c4c-fa81-40d2-9df0-c7e99bf5f900/433ac076-21f3-4342-b391-a4d7d631cd3f.html) or call our automated line at (877) 365-3500.

**Opt Out of Advertising Cookies**

 PMC and our advertising partners use cookies and other technologies to collect and share certain information such as your usage activity to deliver ads that are more relevant to you on PMC and other sites or apps. This may be considered a "sale” under the CCPA. You can opt out of this type of sharing by us using the toggle above. When the toggle is enabled, targeted advertising cookies are on. This opt out does not affect other cookies such as strictly necessary or essential cookies. For more information about cookies please see our [Privacy Policy](https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#california).

 You must exercise this choice every PMC site and on each device and browser where you want your choice to apply. If you clear cookies, you must opt out again. You may still receive ads from us (including contextual or based on our own data about you). We will still share some information with those of our partners who function as our service providers, such as to help us measure ad effectiveness, control the frequency, delivery and security of ads, and conduct analytics. This will not opt you out of the use of previously collected and shared information or all interest-based advertising (such as that conducted on other sites). 

 You can also update your browser settings or visit www.aboutads.info/choices to opt-out of certain uses of cookies for advertising purposes. 

 Our downstream partners who are not service providers may re-sell this information. You can request to opt out of such activity by clicking [here](https://www.iabprivacy.com/optout.html) to see a list of participants in the IAB (some of which are our partners) and submitting an opt out request on each entity’s site. Even if you opt out through this link, you will still see ads.
