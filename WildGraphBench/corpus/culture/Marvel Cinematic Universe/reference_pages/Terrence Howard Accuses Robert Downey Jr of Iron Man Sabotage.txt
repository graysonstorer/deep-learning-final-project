Sometimes you might wonder, hey, why did **Don Cheadle** take over the role of James Rhodes in Marvel’s _[Iron Man](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/iron-man/)_ movies? Someone asked original Rhodey **[Terrence Howard](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/terrence-howard/)** that very question during his appearance on Bravo’s _Watch What Happens Live_ last night, and he responded with an answer that he said was “going to get me into a lot of trouble.”

“It turns out that the person that I helped become Iron Man, when it was time to […] re-up for the second one took the money that was supposed to go to me and pushed me out,” Howard said. “We did a three-picture deal. So that means, you did the deal ahead of time. It was going to be a certain amount for the first one, a certain amount for the second, certain amount for the third.

[**STORY: Marvel’s Kevin Feige Avoids ‘Iron Man’ Drama in Twitter Chat**](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/kevin-feige-twitter-chat-marvel-520734)

He continued, “They came to me [for] the second and said, ‘We will pay you one-eighth of what we contractually had for you, because we think the second one will be successful with or without you.’ And I called my friend that I helped get the first job, and he didn’t call me back for three months.”

This isn’t the first time Howard has complained about his dismissal from the franchise; in [an interview earlier this year](http://www.hollywood.com/news/movies/55003078/terrence-howard-iron-man-dead-man-down), he described his replacement in _[Iron Man 2](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/iron-man-2/)_ as “killing my career.”

Amid groans from the audience, Howard was asked how his relationship was with **Robert Downey Jr.** now. “Oh, I love him,” Howard replied deadpan. “God’s gonna bless him.” That’s what happens when you hang out with Thor, after all.

### Do Not Sell My Personal Information

This page enables California residents to opt-out of sharing of information that may be a sale of personal information under the CCPA. Please review all of your choices below. You can also review our [Privacy Policy.](https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#california)

**Contact Information & Subscription Information**

 We sell or license certain information, such as contact information or subscription information, to third parties to provide you with offers and promotions and opportunities that may be of interest to you. If you would like to opt out of the sale of this information, please use this [webform](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/e65b3c4c-fa81-40d2-9df0-c7e99bf5f900/433ac076-21f3-4342-b391-a4d7d631cd3f.html) or call our automated line at (877) 365-3500.

**Opt Out of Advertising Cookies**

 PMC and our advertising partners use cookies and other technologies to collect and share certain information such as your usage activity to deliver ads that are more relevant to you on PMC and other sites or apps. This may be considered a "sale” under the CCPA. You can opt out of this type of sharing by us using the toggle above. When the toggle is enabled, targeted advertising cookies are on. This opt out does not affect other cookies such as strictly necessary or essential cookies. For more information about cookies please see our [Privacy Policy](https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#california).

 You must exercise this choice every PMC site and on each device and browser where you want your choice to apply. If you clear cookies, you must opt out again. You may still receive ads from us (including contextual or based on our own data about you). We will still share some information with those of our partners who function as our service providers, such as to help us measure ad effectiveness, control the frequency, delivery and security of ads, and conduct analytics. This will not opt you out of the use of previously collected and shared information or all interest-based advertising (such as that conducted on other sites). 

 You can also update your browser settings or visit www.aboutads.info/choices to opt-out of certain uses of cookies for advertising purposes. 

 Our downstream partners who are not service providers may re-sell this information. You can request to opt out of such activity by clicking [here](https://www.iabprivacy.com/optout.html) to see a list of participants in the IAB (some of which are our partners) and submitting an opt out request on each entity’s site. Even if you opt out through this link, you will still see ads.

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information to third parties.
