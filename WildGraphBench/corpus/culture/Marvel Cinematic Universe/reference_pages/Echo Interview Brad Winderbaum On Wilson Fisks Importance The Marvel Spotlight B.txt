Disney Plus has started development on Echo, an MCU spin-off of the Hawkeye series, featuring Native American martial artist Maya Lopez.

_Screen Rant_ interviewed Marvel producer Brad Winderbaum about the new series, _Echo_. He explained what inspired the idea of Marvel Spotlight and discussed collaborating with the Choctaw Nation. Winderbaum also teased the importance of _Echo_[to Wilson Fisk's story](https://web.archive.org/web/20240103174654/https://screenrant.com/how-kingpin-fisk-is-alive-in-echo/) and finally shared an answer about how the Netflix shows, notably _Daredevil_, fit into the MCU.

Brad Winderbaum Talks Echo
--------------------------

**Screen Rant: _Echo_ is phenomenal. I love stories like _Ozark_, _Sons of Anarchy_, and this is the MCU version of that.**

> Brad Winderbaum: Thank you so much for saying that.

**Has the Marvel Spotlight been thought of prior to _Hawkeye_, or when did you guys make that decision?**

> Brad Winderbaum: Marvel Spotlight was something that we came up with in post-production on Echo. It's interesting, having been a film producer and a television producer, learning, sometimes the hard way, the difference between the two mediums. A film is like a statement, but a show is like a conversation, and it's a conversation with multiple writers in the room. It's a conversation with your directors, the ensemble cast. It takes place over a longer period of time and ultimately, it's a conversation with the culture.
> 
> 
> As part of the cultural conversation, it was important for this show to set expectations in a way that told the audience or conveyed that you don't need to know what happened to Thanos to enjoy this show. You can, and she lives and breathes in the same world, but you don't have to. And we wanted as many people to experience this show as possible, so anyone who's a casual fan or doesn't know any of the other stuff could jump in blind and enjoy it on its own terms.

**Speaking of Thanos, it feels like Wilson Fisk is like the Thanos of this street-level corner of the MCU. Is that the case going forward? Is he like what we're building towards?**

> Brad Winderbaum: Oh, man, you kind of hit the nail on the head. I can't say too much. Only that as a chapter in Wilson Fisk's life, this is a crucial one and sets the stage in some remarkable ways for what's coming next.

**Can you talk about working with the Choctaw Nation to bring this authenticity to Maya?**

> Brad Winderbaum: Yeah, they were partners since the beginning. Sid, our director and executive producer, went to Oklahoma and pitched the show and always had a very conversational approach. That's always been Sid's vibe. She's one of the most collaborative filmmakers I've ever worked with, and I think certainly that was the case with her interactions with Choctaw Nation and they were part of the DNA of the show from the beginning. I would say sometimes consultants are a layer on top. It's all braided together.

**In that first episode, we see this amazing fight scene with Daredevil and Maya. It is absolutely incredible. But speaking of _Daredevil_, is everything that happened in the Netflix series a part of the Sacred Timeline or is it not?**

> Brad Winderbaum: I can say that up until this point, we've been a little bit cagey about what's Sacred Timeline, what's not Sacred Timeline. That was born of, frankly, a period at the studio where we were like, "We have to stick the landing with the vendors." It was another part of the company developing the Netflix stuff. We were aware of what they were doing, they were aware of what we were doing, but there was a lot to balance anyway.
> 
> 
> But now that some time has passed; now that we see actually how well integrated the stories are, I think that I personally, Brad Winderbaum, would be confident in saying it is part of the Sacred Timeline.
