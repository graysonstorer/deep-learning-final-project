Now that you’ve watched the Marvel Cinematic Universe come to life —on both the big and small screen — see how it all initially came together with Marvel Studios’ _ASSEMBLED_. The new comprehensive documentary series of specials goes behind-the-scenes of the shows and movies of the MCU, following the filmmakers, cast and crew, and Marvel heroes every step of the way.

_ASSEMBLED_ will take viewers through productions such as [_WandaVision_](https://www.marvel.com/tv-shows/wandavision/1), [_The Falcon and The Winter Soldier_](https://www.marvel.com/tv-shows/the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier/1), and [_Loki_](https://www.marvel.com/tv-shows/loki/1) via exclusive on-set footage. Join filmmakers and stars like Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner as they detail the genesis of the [Black Widow film](https://www.marvel.com/movies/black-widow), and the [Hawkeye series](https://www.marvel.com/tv-shows/hawkeye/1).

Arriving on the streaming service shortly after theatrical releases and series completions, _ASSEMBLED_ is an immersive, and in-depth examination of the next phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and will arrive soon on Disney+

The first episode of _ASSEMBLED_ will focus on the critically acclaimed _WandaVision_. Join Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany and WandaVision’s creative team as the episode pulls back the curtain on this highly groundbreaking series. Learn how the production’s surprising concept took shape by drawing inspiration from classic sitcoms. Witness how the crew went to great lengths to emulate various filmmaking methods used during the early years of television. Discover the unique challenges and ultimate rewards of performing an entire episode in front of a live studio audience. Spend time with exciting newcomers to the MCU, such as Teyonah Parris and Kathryn Hahn, along with returning favorites like Kat Dennings and Randall Park.

**_Assembled: The Making of WandaVision_**, premiering on March 12,is an all-encompassing look at Marvel Studios’ first, and arguably most unusual, streaming series.
