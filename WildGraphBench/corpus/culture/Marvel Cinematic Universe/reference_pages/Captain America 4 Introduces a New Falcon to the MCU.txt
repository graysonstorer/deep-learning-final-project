Top Gun: Maverick's Danny Ramirez will be returning to the MCU as Joaquin Torres to take up the mantle of Falcon in Captain America: New World Order.

![Image 7: falcon-winter-soldier-ep1-Danny-Ramirez](https://web.archive.org/web/20220912233516/https:/www.cbr.com/captain-america-4-danny-ramirez-falcon-mcu/)

Sam Wilson may be leaving behind his old persona in _[Captain America: New World Order](https://web.archive.org/web/20220912233516/http://www.cbr.com/tag/captain-america)_, but the role of the Falcon is being passed down to a new hero. Danny Ramirez is slated to play a new incarnation of the character, as Lieutenant Joaquin Torres.

As revealed in an announcement at the 2022 D23 Expo, _Top Gun: Maverick_ actor Danny Ramirez will be reprising his role as the idealistic Air Force lieutenant Joaquin Torres, who appeared in _Falcon and the Winter Soldier._ Torres was teased to return as the Falcon in future projects during the show's run, but his return was left unconfirmed. This announcement solidifies that Ramirez will be returning to the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Torres and will get to don the winged Falcon costume, potentially fighting alongside Anthony Mackie's Captain America.

Who Is Joaquin Torres?
----------------------

Torres was previously limited to supporting Sam Wilson and providing intelligence during _The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_'s six-episode run. The series ended with Wilson passing down his old suit to Torres, having no need for it after becoming the new Captain America. After Torres gives an inspiring speech, Wilson picks up his newly acquired shield and leaves behind his mechanical wing suit, marking his full transformation into his new identity and giving Torres the opportunity to become the Falcon. Torres is currently the Falcon in the comics, and serves as a sidekick to Sam Wilson's Captain America after being rescued from the Sons of the Serpent.

Ramirez will be joined by _Falcon and the Winter Soldier_ alumni [Carl Lumbly as Isaiah Bradley](https://web.archive.org/web/20220912233516/https://www.cbr.com/captain-america-4-return-isaiah-bradley/) and new character [Shira Haas as Sabra](https://web.archive.org/web/20220912233516/https://www.cbr.com/captain-america-4-casts-sabra-israel/), an Israeli hero new to the MCU. They will face off against a minor antagonist from 2008's _Incredible Hulk_ now given center stage: Tim Blake Nelson returns to play [Samuel Sterns, a.k.a. "The Leader"](https://web.archive.org/web/20220912233516/https://www.cbr.com/captain-america-4-return-the-leader-marvel-cinematic-universe/), confirmed to be the main villain of _New World Order._ Julius Onah is set to direct the film, having previously helmed _The Cloverfield Paradox_ and _Luce_.

Although Ramirez is no stranger to high-altitude action, having played Fanboy in the critically acclaimed _Top Gun: Maverick,_ he has starred in a variety of different roles prior to joining the MCU. He played Mario Martinez in the Netflix original _On My Block_ and was recently in anthology series _Tales of the Walking Dead_ as Eric. Though he's already appeared in a Marvel streaming series, _New World Order_ will mark his MCU movie debut.

_Captain America: New World Order_ will premiere in theaters May 3, 2024.
