'Spider-Man' Spinoff 'Venom' Revived at Sony (Exclusive)
========================================================

 Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach, stewards of the 'Spider-Man' properties, are producing and overseeing the new film, which will be written by 'Edge of Tomorrow' scribe Dante Harper. 

Now that Sony has set _Spider-Man_ on its rebooted path, the studio is setting its sights on other Spider-Man franchises. Case in point: _Venom_.

Sony has tapped Dante Harper to pen a script for _Venom_, something that is being envisioned as a franchise apart from and unrelated to the upcoming _Spider-Man_ movie in the works with actor Tom Holland.

Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach, among stewards of the _Spider-Man_ properties, are producing and overseeing the project.

Venom is one of Marvel’s top villains and a Spider-Man fixture since he was introduced in 1988, created by writer David Michelinie and artists Todd McFarlane and Mike Zeck. The character is an alien symbiote that needs a human host to survive. In return, the alien empowers its victim with incredible powers.

For the longest time, Venom was a villain but then morphed into an antihero and even (almost) good guy. In his current incarnation, Venom is paired with Flash Thompson, a Peter Parker bully-turned-close friend and now a government agent.

It is unclear which Venom incarnation is being used for the new project.

The character made a screen appearance in _Spider-Man 3_ and was played by Topher Grace. A spinoff has been in development in several incarnations, with Gary Ross and Josh Trank among the directors coming and going, and writers such as Paul Wernick and Rhett Reese (_Deadpool_) and Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci penning versions.

This _Venom_ is meant to not only stand on its own but to also launch its own franchise.

Palak Patel and Eric Fineman are overseeing _Venom_ for Sony’s Columbia label.

Harper is an up-and-coming scribe who wrote _Edge of Tomorrow_, the time travel sci-fi movie that starred Tom Cruise. He also co-wrote _Sleepless Night_, the crime thriller that stars Jamie Foxx and Dermot Mulroney.

He is repped by CAA, Management 360, and Lichter, Grossman.
