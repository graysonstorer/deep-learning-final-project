Marvel has landed another series on ABC: _The Inhumans_.

The comic book studio — which previously abandoned plans for an _Inhumans_ feature film — is now set to team with ABC Studios for an eight-episode live-action drama series set to premiere in the fall of 2017.

Few details are known about the project, including producers, cast and premise. The first two episodes of the series will debut in Imax theaters for two weeks in summer 2017 before moving to ABC in September where they will be followed by six subsequent new episodes.

Sources note that this is not the planned _Inhumans_ feature film, which was initially set for July 2019 but pulled from the schedule. It is also not a spinoff of Marvel drama _Agents of SHIELD_, which has spent a good deal of time exploring a storyline about its Inhumans.

The Inhumans, a race of superhumans with diverse and singularly unique powers, were first introduced in Marvel Comics by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby in 1965. Since then, they have become among the most popular characters in the Marvel Universe.

ABC's _The Inhumans_ will explore the never-before-told epic adventure of Black Bolt and the royal family.

For ABC, this marks the latest Marvel drama to join the network's schedule. The network last season canceled Agent Carter after two seasons and passed on a spinoff of _Agents of SHIELD_. Marvel, meanwhile, is teaming with Hulu on another comic book-based series that is in development and has a full slate of dramas at Netflix as well as upcoming X-Men spinoff _Legion_ at FX, among other projects.

The big-screen version of _The Inhumans_ was announced two years ago for a 2018 release. It was pushed back to 2019 as part of a shuffle to make room for _Spider-Man: Homecoming_, before being pulled from the schedule in April. Marvel had been positioning the Inhumans to be the Marvel Cinematic Universe's answer to _The X-Men_. In recent comics, Marvel has portrayed them as a persecuted minority, similar to the Marvel mutant characters Fox has the film and TV rights to.

For Imax, this marks the first time a TV series has debuted in theaters in this fashion. Imax will also serve as a financing participant on the pilot. It's also the first time a TV series has debuted in Imax.

“This unprecedented alliance represents a bold, innovative approach to launching great TV content for a worldwide audience,” said Ben Sherwood, co-chairman, Disney Media Networks and president, Disney|ABC Television Group. “It highlights Disney|ABC’s unrelenting commitment to finding new and creative ways to showcasing our very best programming and increasing global engagement and reach.”

_The Inhumans_ TV series will also be filmed completely with Imax cameras.
