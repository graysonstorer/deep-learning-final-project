Spider-Man: Far From Home Messes Up MCU's Timeline On Disney+
=============================================================

By[Thomas Bacon](https://screenrant.com/author/thob/)

Published Nov 26, 2022

Spider-Man: Far From Home has been added to Disney+ in some overseas markets, but unfortunately it's made a mess of the MCU Disney+ timeline.

![Image 9: Spider-Man Far From Home Disney Plus Placement](https://screenrant.com/spiderman-far-from-home-mcu-timeline-disney-plus/)

[_**Spider-Man: Far From Home**_](https://screenrant.com/tag/spider-man-homecoming-2/) causes yet more problems with the official MCU timeline on Disney+. The MCU's Spider-Man films have been associated with a number of continuity problems in the shared universe, with [_Spider-Man: Homecoming_](https://screenrant.com/tag/spider-man-homecoming/) incorrectly claiming it was set eight years after the events of [_The Avengers_](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers/) - when in fact it was just four years later. That prompted Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige to suggest Marvel should one day publish an official MCU timeline, an idea that ultimately became part of the MCU's offering on Disney+.

The [Disney+ timeline is widely considered broken](https://screenrant.com/disney-plus-mcu-timeline-break-explained/), however, and _Spider-Man: Far From Home_ is making matters worse. The film has been added to Disney+ in some international territories, beginning with Japan in June. Viewers who refer to the MCU in chronological order will see it has been added between [_The Falcon & the Winter Soldier_](https://screenrant.com/tag/falcon-and-winter-soldier/) and [_Shang-Chi & the Legend of the Ten Rings_](https://screenrant.com/tag/shang-chi/), which would set it in spring 2024 in the MCU timeline. This can't possibly be correct, because the film tells the story of Peter Parker's summer vacation to Europe.

Far From Home Makes Disney+'s Broken MCU Timeline Worse
-------------------------------------------------------

![Image 10: Peter crying in Spider-Man Far From Home](https://screenrant.com/spiderman-far-from-home-mcu-timeline-disney-plus/)

_Spider-Man: Far From Home_ is being added to a section of the Disney+ timeline that was already incorrect. Dialogue in _The Falcon & the Winter Soldier_ explicitly sets the Disney+ TV show six months after [_Avengers: Endgame_](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers-4/), which would mean it takes place in late April and early May 2024. The [end of](https://screenrant.com/shang-chi-ending-explained-mcu-future-questions/)_[Shang-Chi](https://screenrant.com/shang-chi-ending-explained-mcu-future-questions/)_ occurs on the day of Qingming, a Chinese festival that takes place in early April. The Disney+ MCU chronology has clearly put those two entries back-to-front, and now _Spider-Man: Far From Home_ - a summer vacation movie that claims to be eight months after _Avengers: Endgame_ - has been placed between them. That whole section of the timeline is clearly wrong.

Where Spider-Man: Far From Home SHOULD Go In The MCU Timeline
-------------------------------------------------------------

![Image 11](https://screenrant.com/spiderman-far-from-home-mcu-timeline-disney-plus/)

There are many occasions where the MCU timeline is a matter of interpretation. [_Moon Knight_](https://screenrant.com/tag/moon-knight/), for example, contains few explicit clues to its placement - although, appropriately, some attentive viewers have noted the phases of the moon can be used to date the show. The placement of [_Thor: Love & Thunder_](https://screenrant.com/tag/thor-4/) is particularly problematic, and there's intense debate over how [Thor's latest adventure fits into the MCU timeline](https://screenrant.com/thor-love-thunder-mcu-timeline/). What is surprising, though, is that the section of the timeline containing _Spider-Man: Far From Home_ is actually one of the easiest to figure out.

_Shang-Chi & the Legend of the Ten Rings_ must come first, simply because it builds to a climax in early April (probably on April 4, the date of Qingming in 2024). It is then followed by _The Falcon & the Winter Soldier_, which explicitly dates itself in late April or early May, six months after Thanos' snap was reversed - an event confirmed many times to take place on October 17, 2023. _Spider-Man: Far From Home_ would come next, beginning another two months after the Blip and telling the story of Peter Parker's summer vacation. This part of the [MCU viewing order](https://screenrant.com/marvel-movies-rewatch-order/) is one of the most clearly-defined, but the very incorrect placement of _Shang-Chi_ is made worse by putting _**Spider-Man: Far From Home**_ before it. Marvel has made changes to the Disney+ timeline before now, swapping the order of [_Black Widow_](https://screenrant.com/tag/black-widow/) and [_Black Panther_](https://screenrant.com/tag/black-panther/), so hopefully they'll eventually put _Shang-Chi_ in the right place too.
