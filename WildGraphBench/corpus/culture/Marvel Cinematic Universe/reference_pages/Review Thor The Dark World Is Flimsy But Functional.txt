[![Image 11](http://b-i.forbesimg.com/scottmendelson/files/2013/10/thor-the-dark-world-poster-202x300.jpg)](http://b-i.forbesimg.com/scottmendelson/files/2013/10/thor-the-dark-world-poster.jpg)**The Box Office:**

This is an important test for Disney and Marvel. _[Iron Man 3](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/iron\_man\_3 "Iron Man 3")_ was always going to be a massive blockbuster regardless of _[Avengers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers\_%28comics%29 "Avengers (comics)")_-spill over. But the fact that it made $1.2 billion worldwide, basically double the $623m gross of _[Iron Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron\_Man "Iron Man") 2,_ implies that there is quite a bit of spillover. So the question becomes, does _[Thor: The Dark World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor%3A\_The\_Dark\_World "Thor: The Dark World")_ play as a conventional sequel, opening a little bit higher and opening just over/under the original’s domestic take while increasing overseas numbers? Or is _The Avengers-_ effect such that _Thor: The Dark World_ will basically play like _The Avengers 1.5_?

We won’t know until we know, but we’ll get a pretty good sneak peak as the film opens overseas this week in advance of its November 8th domestic debut, which has been the pattern going back to _Iron Man 2_ in 2010 for the Marvel studios films.Ironically, the character of Loki, played by [Tom Hiddleston](http://twitter.com/twhiddleston "Tom Hiddleston"), has grown in popularity to such an extent that his presence in the film amounts to an “added value element” in lieu of a more marquee villain. It’s no secret that Marvel went back and added more Loki footage late in the post-production game.

The film’s biggest advantage among general moviegoers who aren’t necessarily comic fans is the sheer sex appeal of the cast. No matter your sexual persuasion, you have a host of eye candy in this one. You’ve got [Chris Hemsworth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hemsworth "Chris Hemsworth"), [](http://www.forbes.com/profile/natalie-portman/)[Natalie Portman](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/natalie_portman "Natalie Portman"), Tom Hiddleston, Kat Dennings, [Idris Elba](http://www.driis.com/ "Idris Elba"), [Rene Russo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rene_Russo "Rene Russo"), Chris Dowd, and/or Jamie Alexander to hold your prurient attention while the gods do battle on Asgard and on Earth. I may elaborate on this later, but when it comes to marketing to both genders, sometimes it pays to, I dunno, have more than one major female character to put on the poster.

So it stands to reason that _Thor: The Dark World_ will outgross the $449 million worldwide total of _Thor_, but to what extent is the big question.Was _Iron Man 3_ the lucky beneficiary of _The Avengers_‘s popularity, or was _The Avengers_ basically taken as _Iron Man 3: The Avengers_? If _Thor: The Dark World_ goes supernova, it will mean that for the time being Marvel has created a series of franchises where each installment will play to the upper levels of theoretical potential. But if _Thor: The Dark World_ plays closer to $500-$550m, it will mean that _Iron Man_ really is the lynch-pin of the Marvel universe and _Thor_ is basically “just” a 3D-enhanced _X-Men_-level franchise. That’s not a terrible place to be, but we’ll see…

**The Review:**

More than any other prior installment, _Thor: The Dark World_ exposes Marvel’s grand film universe as a glorified television series. If the first _Iron Man_ was the pilot and _The Avengers_ was the first season finale, then _Thor: The Dark World_ is basically a ‘stand-alone’ episode that contains little long-range mythology. In _X-Files_ terms, it’s a “monster of the week” episode. While comics have a problem where it sometimes feels like every week’s issue of a given title promises status-quo changing shockers rather than just telling a good story, there is perhaps an understanding that a movie installment of a given franchise shouldn’t amount to optional viewing.

As a film, Alan Taylor’s sequel to [Kenneth Branagh](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/kenneth_branagh "Kenneth Branagh")‘s _Thor_ is basically a mess. It’s clear that the picture underwent all sorts of post-production tinkering (several moments from the trailers are missing from the film), as much of the would-be plot amounts to exposition punctuated by action beats. The good news is that the crackling character chemistry from the first installment is still present this time around, with the bonus that Tom Hiddleston’s Loki doesn’t have to pretend to be virtuous for much of the running time. More than any other Marvel franchise, _Thor_ lives purely on the strength of its cast.

The plot is as generic as can be, with poorly developed “dark elves” trying to acquire magical stuff which will in turn plunge all of our worlds into darkness. And yes, without going into too many spoilers, the finale again involves a big battle in a public place while other characters frantically attempt to stop some random special effects from destroying the world. I couldn’t tell you exactly what was going on in the non-action portion of the finale, and the film doesn’t really care if you do. The film emphasizes that superhero comic book films are eventually going to have to get away from “hero must save the world from a new super-villain” stories as they are starting to mesh together.

The good news is that, as noted above, the character work shines despite the wobbly story. I wouldn’t quite say that the script is “clever”, but the dialogue is peppy and everyone of note gets a few moments to shine. It’s no secret that Natalie Portman didn’t really want to come back, and it’s amusing as the script keeps trying to give her relevant things to do even while overlooking the fact that they turned a take-charge science nerd into a love-struck teenager who basically shut down for two years while she waited for Thor to come back for her. Chris Hemsworth is fine, oozing empathetic charisma even as his brother gets most of the best lines. It’s to the film’s credit that Hiddleston’s fan-pleasing snark doesn’t feel forced even as it’s painfully expected at this point. Rene Russo gets more to do this time but Jamie Alexander is a non-entity (although kudos for perhaps cutting the love triangle melodrama hinted at in the trailers).

The action is a mixed bag. The second-act set piece is suitably grand and consequential, even if the main characters are kept away from the action for much of it. The resulting mass funeral for slaughtered Asgard soldiers is the film’s visual highlight. The opening bursts of action are something fans have clamored for, with Thor in his prime on the battle field, but it’s pretty brief and seems there mostly for trailer-friendly moments. The finale has a clever visual idea that I won’t divulge, but in the end it’s still super-powered beings beating the crap out of each other as a literal time-killer. I don’t know what ideas that original director Patty Jenkins wasn’t “decisive enough” about, but director Alan Taylor offers little unique to call his own, and the film lacks Branagh’s distinct personality.

_Thor: The Dark World_ is basically “functional”. It reunites its cast and lets most of them have more fun, while increasing the scope and action. As expected, the film is somewhat cowardly in terms of rocking the boat, obviously afraid of the fan outcry that greeted the genuinely courageous _Iron Man 3_. Oddly enough, without going into details, the film, like _Iron Man 3_, puts most of its character growth and forward momentum in a last-minute epilogue, as if the filmmakers realized that the film had to have some status-quo change for its main character.The second act offers a compelling post-9/11 allegory on the wisdom of defeating your enemy with a scalpel instead of a broadsword, but the first and third acts are pretty inconsequential.

_Thor: The Dark World_ survives purely on the charisma of its insanely attractive cast and periodic bursts of good humor. But it’s a strictly ‘for the fans’ exercise, with little overall consequence for the big Marvel universe and little appeal outside those who have already bought their tickets.

Did you actually watch the film? Did you miss the last scene in Asgard? That has tremendous implications for the Thor franchise, the final fate of an important character, and it shows, concretely, another major character’s complete evil turn. That last scene’s twist will get all Thor fans talking for years to come, and it is begging for another installment for the franchise, because, for the love of all that is decent and holy, it really cannot end like THAT!

*   [![Image 27: Tristan Enseleit](http://graph.facebook.com/100002451380803/picture?type=square)](http://blogs.forbes.com/people/tristanenseleit/)[Tristan Enseleit](http://blogs.forbes.com/people/tristanenseleit/)3 days ago This reviewer is grasping at straws flimsier than his criticism at Thor’s sequel. I would’ve shown more agreement with him had he compared this film to Iron Man 2 instead of 3 (Iron Man 3 is considered taboo with the twists and changes it made that infuriate fans of the source material; I, however, did enjoy it despite acknowledging the changes but wasn’t a fan of the known names it wasted on characters that were snuffed out by the end of the film, such as Savin and Brandt), because well, this film is essentially “Thor 2″ whereas Iron Man was 1 film ahead (to set up the Marvel Cinematic Universe) of the others coming out this and next year. Iron Man 2 was “flimsy yet functional” and it’s obvious why: it had ALOT of things to squeeze into it to set it up for the next team-up movie. It introduced another Avenger, the Black Widow; see more of Nick Fury to plead Iron Man’s case of joining the Avengers Initiative, Coulson & SHIELD and their tomfoolery/meddling in superhero-concerned affairs; advance Tony Stark’s suit situation/condition all while dealing with a very ominous villain. While Thor 2 may not necessarily introduce tons more new characters (maybe some more of his extended family & friends), it 2 gives us a wider look at the Nine Realms and Thor and Loki’s “bromance” and expositional time before it moves onto Avengers 2: Age of Ultron, as this is the last known film to feature Hiddleston’s fanbase-crazed God of Mischief until he signs another contract securing himself in what will most likely end up being his most recognized role (the guy even role-played it at a Comic Con, for goodness sake; either as a show of dedication to Marvel, this film, to his craft/character and/or for a paycheck. It should be kept in mind that since Thor’s franchise is not of Earth (like all the rest of the Avengers are), his stories/tales take him to places no humans ever go. Fans of fantasy franchises such as Lord of the Rings could potentially find interest/appeal in this part of the Marvel Universe; there may not be any cheeky wizards in pointy hats, but there’s definitely LOTS of magic. The film should have a very large fantasy/adventure feel and taste to it, hence why Marvel would appeal to a Game of Thrones director to take the helm on it and give it that same atmosphere (minus the incest, gratuitous sex, dragons; just add one part Mjolnir, one part magic and other parts characters). I could go on, but since I haven’t yet seen the film and am very excited for it, will be happy it stays truer to its source material and characters than Iron Man 3 did. Even if it doesn’t gross a billion, so what? I hate saying it since my favorite film is the Avengers, but $$$ doesn’t always mean a film is great.

I’s no secret I was a huge fan of IRON MAN 3. THOR 2 just isn’t as good of a movie, and yes it is closest in comparison to IRON MAN 2 in that it’s basically just “This week on Marvel Universe!”. It’s not a terrible film, but it barely hangs together and it’s arguably the first Marvel film that truly feels “made by committee”. I’ll be curious what the overall reaction is as it goes wider into worldwide release. It won’t piss off the hard cores in the way that IRON MAN 3 did (pity…), but I’d argue it’s also not going to inspire much passion. We’ll see.

I’ve yet to see the film, that’s coming next week. But it’s obvious general audiences know how to enjoy big action spectacle much better than film critics do, MOS made that so very obvious this summer as well. Audience seem to love ‘The Dark World’ so far where critics like it but have reservations, I don’t know what you guys are looking for from comic book films but it doesn’t seem to be the same thing we audiences are looking for.

Actually that’s not really true. MoS underperformed at the box office, and Batman was rebooted after just a year and thrown in to the sequel to ensure that the audience would watch another Superman film. Fanboys and kids are very vocal in their praise but reasonable adults dislike it, as shown by the low 7.5/10 on IMDb and the Amazon reviews on both the US and UK sites being over 40% 3 stars or less.

*   [![Image 32: Jorge Torres](http://avatars.zenfs.com/users/1DKUJgw7DAAECrcPH5B1k1JMA.large.png)](http://blogs.forbes.com/people/andrethegiant/)[Jorge Torres](http://blogs.forbes.com/people/andrethegiant/)1 day ago I am a big Thor fan but the first film was a big miss for me. The Warriors three were miscast, at least Volstagg’s part. I agree that Natalie Portman just behaved like a love-sick puppy and it was sad to see her as a giddy schoolgirl. The director pretty much went the route of Twilight with the romance and it looks like this new movie is trying to appeal to female audiences. I’ll wait for the DVD release on this one and save my money for the Captain America movie instead.
