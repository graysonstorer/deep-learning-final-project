[Susana Polo](https://www.polygon.com/authors/susana-polo) is an entertainment editor at Polygon, specializing in pop culture and genre fare, with a primary expertise in comic books. Previously, she founded [The Mary Sue](https://www.themarysue.com/). 

[_Ms. Marvel_](https://www.polygon.com/23943461/the-marvels-ms-marvel-kamala-khan-iman-vellani) is one of the most charming projects to come out of the recent [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://www.polygon.com/23519049/best-marvel-movies-mcu-ranked-worst), and that’s owed in large part to its lead actor. [Iman Vellani](https://www.polygon.com/23843432/ms-marvel-actor-iman-vellani-x-men-comic-interview) brought breakout Marvel Comics superhero [Kamala Khan](https://www.polygon.com/23167430/ms-marvel-bangle-origin-story-kamran-najma) to the small and big screen with megawatt charm.

So when Polygon sat down with Vellani in advance of this Saturday’s 2024 Anime Awards, we had to know: Have the folks behind the MCU assured her that Ms. Marvel has a place in its future?

“I have been assured,” she replied, and continued, with good humor, “So that feels good, but there was no more assurance than that. [_laugh_] They give me breadcrumbs, and I try and make a meal out of it.”

Vellani’s last MCU project was [_The Marvels_](https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23952209/the-marvels-review-kamala-khan-captain-marvel), which concluded with a big tease for a teenage superhero team featuring Vellani’s Ms. Marvel, [Hailee Steinfeld’s Hawkeye](https://www.polygon.com/22798331/hawkeye-kate-bishop-marvel), and other teenage superheroes in Nick Fury’s database, like [Kathryn Newton’s Stinger](https://www.polygon.com/23340059/ant-man-wasp-quantumania-trailer-marvel-release-date). The scene is the closest Marvel Studios has come to confirming a production featuring the Young Avengers team, though many characters traditionally associated with the comic book version of the team have [already appeared in the MCU at least once](https://www.polygon.com/23954016/marvels-young-avengers-kamala-khan-final-scene).

Alternatively, now that Ms. Marvel is [a known mutant character](https://www.polygon.com/23794887/new-ms-marvel-comic-mutant-mcu-actor), Vellani might also be tapped for whatever Marvel Studios plans to do with the X-Men franchise. But with the company’s output being significantly retooled in the wake of [high profile firings](https://www.polygon.com/23690099/marvel-jonathan-majors-dropped-kang-recast) and [a string of poorly received projects](https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23942085/marvel-studios-new-avengers-movie-resurrect-iron-man-black-widow), it’s also unclear when anything that incorporates the X-Men into the MCU would swim into focus.

For now, at least, Vellani remains assured.
