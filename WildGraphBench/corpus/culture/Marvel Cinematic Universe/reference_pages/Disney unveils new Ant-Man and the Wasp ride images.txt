D23 Expo Japan is buzzing with new information about Hong Kong Disneyland’s new _Ant-Man and the Wasp_ ride.

Three days after confirming that the Disney World Resort’s EPCOT park is getting a _Guardians of the Galaxy_ roller coaster, Disney unveiled at the annual convention new renderings of its planned _Ant-Man and the Wasp_ attraction currently under construction at the 13-year-old theme park.

The interactive ride — Hong Kong Disneyland’s second to be adapted from a Marvel property, following the [debut of its _Iron Man_ simulator in 2016](http://ew.com/movies/2016/12/26/iron-man-experience-pov-ride-video/)— is set to open in a show building previously occupied by the _Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters_ attraction.

Based on the upcoming film of the same name, the _Ant-Man and the Wasp_ experience will immerse guests in a cinematic battle pitting Ant-Man (Paul Rudd) and the Wasp (Evangeline Lilly) against the villainous Arnim Zola and his army of Hydra swarm bots. As they were throughout the _Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters_ narrative, _Ant-Man and the Wasp_ riders will be armed with laser-powered weapons, which they can fire at enemies throughout the enclosed course.

_Ant-Man and the Wasp_ represents just one face of the resort’s [multi-year expansion plan](https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2017/05/frozen-marvel-and-more-coming-to-hong-kong-disneyland/) that will see $1.4 billion worth of improvements added to the Hong Kong property through 2023. Other additions include two new lands: one themed to the animated film _Frozen_, and another populated by characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe (featuring a massive indoor _Avengers_ ride), as well as a new _Moana_-inspired performance venue and modifications to the entrance plaza’s Sleeping Beauty Castle.
