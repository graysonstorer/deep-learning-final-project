The first trailer for [What If…? – An Immersive Story](https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-what-if-an-immersive-story-apple-vision-pro) is here, offering a first look at the interactive adventure coming exclusively to the Apple Vision Pro.

Marvel Studios and LucasFilm subsidiary ILM Immersive dropped a trailer for What If…? – An Immersive Story to give fans a better idea of what to expect from the mixed reality experience as it is now only days away from release (it will be available as a free app for a limited time on May 30, exclusively on Apple Vision Pro).

The trailer positions the Vision Pro user as a hero travelling across the Multiverse to combat various threats under the guidance of Wong. The footage shows a mixture of story content and real-life player interaction as those donning the headset learn to cast mystic spells, harness the power of the Infinity Stones, and more.

There are also a few familiar faces from the Marvel character catalogue, including versions of fan-favorites like Thanos, Hela, the Collector, and Red Guardian. Players will meet these variants in what the press release calls "an hour-long, narrative-driven journey" involving reality-defining choices and epic battles.

"What If…? – An Immersive Story is the result of what can happen when you bring together the incredible talent at ILM Immersive, Marvel Studios, and Disney+ to push the boundaries of technology in the service of telling our stories in new and exciting ways," executive producer Shereif M. Fattouh said.

"This project touches upon the cornerstone of the desire that our studios share to constantly experiment and innovate, and thanks to the capabilities of Apple Vision Pro, we get to place you directly inside a Universe that means so much to us all. I can't wait for fans to become the hero in this completely new way."

[What if...?](https://www.ign.com/tv/what-if) is an animated TV series that [hit Disney+ in 2021](https://www.ign.com/articles/new-to-disney-plus-august-2021-movies-tv-shows-originals), with a second season [premiering last December](https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-what-if-season-2-release-window-sdcc-mcu). As the title implies, the show explores alternate timelines to show what would happen if key moments from the Marvel Cinematic Universe played out differently. The show quickly became popular for Marvel Studios, with [a third season currently developing](https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-shares-new-look-of-what-if-season-3) alongside a spinoff series called [Marvel Zombies](https://www.ign.com/articles/spider-man-freshman-year-agatha-wandavision-marvel-zombies-disney-announced).

Fans of the series will now be able to explore that prism of possibilities with the release of What If…? – An Immersive Story on May 30.
