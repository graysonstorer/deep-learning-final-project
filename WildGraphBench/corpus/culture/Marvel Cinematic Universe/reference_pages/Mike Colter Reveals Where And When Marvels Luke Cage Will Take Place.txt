During an interview with ComicBook.com for _Jessica Jones_ at New York Comic Con, Mike Colter spent most of his time talking about approaching the role of Luke Cage on this series ([and saying his catchphrase](http://comicbook.com/2015/10/12/first-audio-of-marvels-luke-cage-actor-mike-colter-saying-sweet-/)), but he did also drop some new tidbits about _Luke Cage_, the next series in development for Netflix and Marvel, and the third of the four _Defenders_ series.

"I can tell you what they’ve allowed me to, which is basically, _Luke Cage_ will take place a few months after _Jessica Jones,_" Colter said. "So in real time, if you watch _Jessica Jones_, you’ll find [at the end] Luke Cage uptown in Harlem, working, trying to make ends meet. Luke Cage really hasn’t figured out what he’s doing. He’s tending bar, he’s bouncing around. And for good reason, he’s a fugitive, he has some skeletons in his closet

"He’s trying to basically stay off the radar. The people he hangs around with, though, are in need. Ultimately, he’d rather be alone, but with the way he’s equipped he does step up. That’s what it’s about, it’s about finding that inner feeling to make you want to take action. Sometimes we just sit around, and sit on our hands and don’t do anything because it’s like 'hey, that’s not my problem.' You can’t do that when you’re a superhero. You have these gifts, now use them."

Sounds like Luke Cage could learn a lesson or two from Spider-Man there. To sum it up, it sounds like _Luke Cage_ will certainly feel unique from _Daredevil_ and _Jessica Jones_ if only because of the scenery change.

"So I can say you’ll find him uptown in Harlem, and in a completely different world from Hell’s Kitchen."

It should be noted, this won't be Harlem's first appearance in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In 2008's _The Incredible Hulk,_ Harlem had copious destruction done to the neighborhood at the hands of The Hulk and Abomination. While we might not see the physical evidence of that anymore, the lasting distrust of powered types might still be present.

Glad they are keeping the same trend of already having powers. No need forfor origins just clever flashbacks
