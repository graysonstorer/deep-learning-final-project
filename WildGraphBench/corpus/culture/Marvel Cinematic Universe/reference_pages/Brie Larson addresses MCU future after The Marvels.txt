# Brie Larson addresses MCU future after The Marvels

[Brie Larson](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a40651222/captain-marvel-brie-larson-fast-x-behind-scenes-teaser/) will star in [the MCU's upcoming crossover movie _The Marvels_](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a26410103/captain-marvel-2-release-date/) alongside Teyonah Parris and [Iman Vellani](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a40314717/ms-marvel-iman-vellani-chastised-kevin-feige/), but who knows how many more MCU appearances the _[Captain Marvel](https://www.digitalspy.com/captain-marvel/)_ actress will make?

Larson appeared at this year's D23 Expo at a panel for _[The Marvels](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a40364799/ms-marvel-iman-vellani-the-marvels-role/)_ alongside her co-stars and MCU boss Kevin Feige. But when [_Variety_](https://twitter.com/Variety/status/1568727667746435072) asked her if she'd be returning to the MCU following her role in _The Marvels_, Larson was unsure.

"I don't know. I don't know, does anyone want me to do it again? I don't know, I really don't know. I don't have an answer to that," Larson said.

Whilst this may be a response towards troll comments, it may also be a generic answer to keep an air of mystery about the future of the character. Time will reveal all.

Larson has featured as Carol Danvers, AKA Captain Marvel, in just two MCU movies so far: her own solo movie, _[Captain Marvel](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a26650625/captain-marvel-first-reviews/)_, plus _[Avengers: Endgame](https://www.digitalspy.com/avengers/)_. However, she has also cameoed in the post-credits scene of _[Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a37443388/shang-chi-2-release-date/)_ and the season finale of the [Disney+](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X991730&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fen-gb&sref=https%3A%2Fwww.digitalspy.com%2Fmovies%2Fa41168451%2Fbrie-larson-marvel-future%2F&xcust=%5Butm_source%7C%5Butm_campaign%7C%5Butm_medium%7C%5Bgclid%7C%5Bmsclkid%7C%5Bfbclid%7C%5Brefdomain%7C%5Bcontent_id%7C287d5835-437d-4736-b248-071824a5c51c%5Bcontent_product_id%7C09477bdf-63ba-4114-922b-2de89518be0a%5Bproduct_retailer_id%7C) series _[Ms. Marvel](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a40206900/ms-marvel-review-mcu/)_.

In that appearance, [Carol and Vellani's Kamala Khan (Ms. Marvel) magically swapped places](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a40599991/ms-marvel-ending-credits-carol-danvers/) when Khan's super-powered bangle seemed to activate. That left Carol in Kamala's bedroom and Kamala who knows where.

_The Marvels_ will explore the power connection between Carol and Kamala while Parris' [Monica Rambeau, who gained similar superpowers in _WandaVision_](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a35560141/wandavision-captain-marvel-2-monica-rambeau-explained/), will also be a major player. The movie is set to release next year and is directed by _Candyman_ director Nia DaCosta.

_The Marvels_ will be part of [Phase 5 of the MCU](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a40705616/marvel-phase-5-movies-tv-shows-mcu/) and will be the third of four Marvel movies released next year after _[Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/trailers/a40704775/ant-man-3-trailer-wasp-quantumania/)_ and _[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a829022/guardians-of-the-galaxy-3-trailer-cast-release-date/)_. _[Blade](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a40817985/blade-release-date-mcu/)_ will follow.
