# Avengers: Doomsday Will Feature Hayley Atwell as Agent Carter – Report

Marvel regular Hayley Atwell may suit up for yet another Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) flick, as she’s reportedly expected to appear as Peggy Carter a.k.a. Agent Carter in Avengers: Doomsday.

[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/avengers-doomsday-hayley-atwell-agent-carter-1236202943/) reports that the star, who was prominently featured in the original Captain America film as well as spinoffs like the Disney+ What If…? series, is expected to return for the 2026 superhero team-up film. How the film might reintroduce the character remains to be seen, but with the MCU continuing to experiment with multiverse storylines in projects like Deadpool and Wolverine, anything is possible.

Hayley Atwell reportedly expected to return as Agent Carter for Avengers: Doomsday.

In addition to her role as Agent Carter in early MCU movies, Atwell has played small roles in films like Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and Avengers: Endgame. She also led Marvel TV with her own show titled Agent Carter in 2015. Deadline adds that she nearly reappeared alongside Captain America co-star Chris Evans for a standalone movie, but plans fell apart after Marvel was unable to create a solid story.

Even if Atwell doesn’t make an appearance in Avengers: Doomsday, there’s still plenty of room to bring together some of Marvel’s other mightiest heroes. The film, which will be [directed by Marvel movie leaders Joe and Anthony Russo](https://www.ign.com/articles/the-russo-brothers-are-officially-returning-to-direct-avengers-doomsday-and-avengers-secret-wars-sdcc-2024), will see Iron Man star [Robert Downey Jr. returning to the MCU](https://www.ign.com/articles/mcus-doctor-doom-cast-at-last-for-avengers-doomsday-and-its-robert-downey-jr-sdcc-2024) as legendary comic book villain Doctor Doom. Earlier this week, [The Wrap](https://www.thewrap.com/chris-evans-avengers-doomsday-cast-marvel/) reported that [Evans would also be joining the Doomsday cast in some form](https://www.ign.com/articles/chris-evans-returning-to-mcu-to-join-robert-downey-jr-in-avengers-doomsday), though his involvement has yet to be confirmed.

Avengers: Doomsday is currently scheduled to hit theaters May 1, 2026. It will then be followed by Spider-Man 4 on July 24, 2026, with Avengers: Secret Wars set to arrive one year later come May 7, 2027. With so many films and Marvel spinoff projects set to release in the years between Doomsday, there’s no telling how it might be used to reintroduce fan-favorite characters like Iron Man, Captain America, Agent Carter, and more.
