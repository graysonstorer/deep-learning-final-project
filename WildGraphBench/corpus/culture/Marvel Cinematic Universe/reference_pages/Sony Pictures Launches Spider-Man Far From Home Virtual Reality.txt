**CULVER CITY, CA – June 25, 2019** – Sony Pictures Virtual Reality (SPVR) today announced _Spider-Man™: Far From Home, Virtual Reality,_ a new VR experience based on the upcoming film _Spider-Man: Far From Home_, in U.S. theaters July 2. _Spider-Man: Far From Home, Virtual Reality_ gives players the chance to select their favorite Spider-Man suit, and, for the first time, swing high above New York City. _Spider-Man: Far From Home, Virtual Reality_ will be available for free across PlayStation® VR, HTC Vive and Oculus Rift starting June 25.

“There’s no feeling in the world like slinging a web through a New York’s canyon of skyscrapers. After the _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ VR game, fans asked to be able to swing, and we wanted to deliver that in this _Far From Home_ VR experience. With this game, moviegoers will have the chance to live out the thrill they’ve experienced on the comics page and in the movies as they feel what it’s like to be Spider-Man swinging high above Manhattan,” said Jake Zim, SVP, Virtual Reality, Sony Pictures Entertainment.

Based on the new film coming to theatres, the _Spider-Man: Far From Home, Virtual Reality_ experience is a fast-swinging, thrill ride through the eyes of everyone’s favorite neighborhood Spider-Man. In breathtaking virtual reality, Spidey fans will finally have the chance to scale and swing from the highest towers in Manhattan. Players can pick one of four Spider-Man suits and they will be launched into the clouds where they may find a colossal and dangerous enemy awaiting. They can then find and confront New York’s latest attacker in this thrilling, swinging adventure.

In addition to the home release, the VR experience will be available as part of a theater activation tour in North America from June 21-July 7. The _Spider-Man: Far From Home, Virtual Reality_ tour will be powered by the new HP Reverb VR Headsets and HP VR Backpacks. “We are very excited for theater audiences to experience the thrill of swinging above Manhattan as Spider-Man through the new HP Reverb Virtual Reality headset with ground-breaking 2160x2160 resolution which brings new heights to the immersion experience,” said Joanna Popper, Global Head of Virtual Reality for Location Based Entertainment, HP Inc.

_Spider-Man: Far From Home, Virtual Reality_ is produced by Sony Pictures Virtual Reality and developed by Create VR, in collaboration with Intel. SPVR teamed up with Intel earlier this year to launch the world’s first Spider-Man multi-player VR game powered by 5G for attendees at Mobile World Congress.

“Intel and Sony Pictures are harnessing the power of Intel® Xeon® processors and optimized software tools to bring this thrilling ultra-high-resolution _Spider-Man: Far From Home_ VR experience to life with the movie theatrical release and online,” said Lynn Comp, Intel's vice president of the Network Platforms group and general manager of Intel's Visual Cloud division.
