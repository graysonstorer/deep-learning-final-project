 Plus, will we see Shazam on the big screen after all? 

By [Roth Cornet](http://people.ign.com/Roth-IGN)[Geoff Johns](http://www.ign.com/stars/geoff-johns "Geoff Johns"),Chief Creative Officer at DC, was on hand at today's TCA (Television Critics Association) press tour for the CW's [The Flash](http://www.ign.com/tv/the-flash-cw "The Flash") panel, where he reiterated that there would be no crossover between DC television and film, emphasizing that they are each "their own universes."

Following up with Johns post-panel, we asked if it were feasible that we may see one version of The Justice League on the big screen and another on the small as The Flash and [Arrow](http://www.ign.com/tv/arrow "Arrow") expand. He replied."You'll see a lot of DC universe characters [on The Flash and Arrow]. You won't see Batman or Superman. We're on production on Batman V Superman now. So you'll see characters like The Atom or Firestorm, but no not Batman or Superman right now [on TV]."

The decision to keep their TV properties entirely separate from what they are doing in their cinematic universe seems to be one that is both pragmatic and creative. It would certainly be a challenge to maintain continuity with so many different films and an ever increasing slate of shows if there was an attempt to bridge the two.

"It's a separate universe than film so that the filmmakers can tell the story that's best for film," Johns said. "While we explore something different in a different corner of the DC universe."

"We will not be integrating the film and television universes," Johns said definitively.

Audiences have come to expect a certain degree of continuity, however.Stephen Amell fans have certainly spent a good deal of time speculating about a possible appearance in Dawn of Justice. Alas, it does not appear that it is meant to be.

As to Wonder Woman, we know that the character will appear in the upcoming Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice, but President of the CW Mark Pedowitz says is is unclear if she will become a TV character again.

"If she is and we can get the right script we will do it," Pedowitz said.

"One of the nice things is that a lot of the other broadcasters and cable networks have done Comic Book Characters based on the success of Arrow," Pedowitz continued, stressing that the network was certainly open to adding another comic show to their slate. "So for our purposes, it is a rich source material, we know what the mythology is, and if you have the right superhero character you go for it."

Johns feels that as long as things are done well and are not repetitive, then "there's room for everything."

Calling The Rock?

When asked which one character he'd like to see brought to life next, Johns said Shazam. It was unclear if he meant on the big screen or small, but according to a [recent rumor/report about the upcoming DC movie slate](http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/12/dcs-movie-slate-may-have-just-been-revealed), Shazam is the second film scheduled following Dawn of Justice.

Warner Brothers has not yet confirmed that schedule, of course, but with Comic Con just a week away, anything is possible.

We will keep you updated as news on all of these projects emerge.
