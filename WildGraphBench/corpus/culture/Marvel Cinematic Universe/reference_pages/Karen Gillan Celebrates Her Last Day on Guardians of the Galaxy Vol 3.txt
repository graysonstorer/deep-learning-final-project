Karen Gillan Celebrates Her Last Day on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3
----------------------------------------------------------------------

One of Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy has officially left the Benatar. As production on [**Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3**](https://superherohype.com/tag/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3) winds to a close, Nebula actress Karen Gillan announced that she recently wrapped filming on the highly-anticipated sequel.Karen Gillan celebrates.

Gillan shared the news on her Instagram account. To celebrate the occasion, she posted a photo of her chair on the film’s set, adorned with her character’s name along with Nebula’s glove placed on the seat. She also used the opportunity to thank fans and director James Gunn for welcoming her into the Marvel fold. But she was careful not to mention whether the upcoming sequel marks the end of her MCU journey.

“I don’t know if Nebula will return beyond this, it’s possible that this is her final chapter,” wrote Gillan. “And if that’s the case, then I just want to say thank you to James Gunn for giving me such an interesting, complex and fascinating character to play.”

Nebula has come a long way since her introduction in the original [**Guardians of the Galaxy**](https://superherohype.com/tag/guardians-of-the-galaxy) film. Although Gunn could have easily killed her off there, he instead chose to bring her back for [**Vol. 2**](https://superherohype.com/tag/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2) and give her a full-fledged redemption arc. That led to Nebula getting a much more significant role in [**Avengers: Infinity War**](https://superherohype.com/tag/avengers-infinity-war) and [**Endgame**](https://superherohype.com/tag/avengers-endgame). It would be disappointing if Nebula meets her demise in **Vol. 3**. But if that does turn out to be the case, at least she’s going out as one of the MCU’s most nuanced characters.

Regardless, we won’t have to wait until next year to see Nebula again. Gillan is also set to reprise her role in [**Thor: Love and Thunder**](https://superherohype.com/tag/thor-love-and-thunder) on July 8. And later this year, she will also make an appearance in [**The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special**](https://superherohype.com/tag/the-guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special) on Disney+.

**Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3** will hit theaters on May 5, 2023.
