Disney released [the first episode of _Secret Invasion_](https://bgr.com/entertainment/im-shocked-that-secret-invasion-killed-a-main-character-so-soon/) on Disney Plus earlier this week, which delivers a massive blow to the MCU from the start. The gist of the story is that a faction of the Skrulls who arrived on Earth in _Captain Marvel_ has grown unhappy with Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) and Carol Danvers (Brie Larson) for their inability to find them a new home. The Skrull rebels want to turn Earth into their new home instead, hence the conflict.

While we’re in the TV show’s early stages, we learned [plenty of things about the Skrulls](https://bgr.com/entertainment/9-things-we-learned-about-the-skrulls-in-secret-invasion-episode-1/), a race of aliens that we’ll probably meet again. And Marvel also told us where the _Secret Invasion_ sits on the MCU timeline. Before I explain why that’s such a big detail for _Secret Invasion_, be warned that **big spoilers will follow**.

Head over to [Disney Plus](https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/256585/564546/9358?subId1=BGR--&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F&subId3=xid:fr1690555478590did) to play _Secret Invasion_, scroll down to the MCU chronological order, and you’ll see where _Secret Invasion_ sits on the larger [Marvel timeline](https://bgr.com/entertainment/how-to-watch-marvel-movies-in-order/).

The action in _Secret Invasion_ happens at some point after _Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania_. That’s the first MCU movie of the year whose action takes place mostly in the Quantum realm, a place out of time. But _Ant-Man 3_ follows _The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special_, which is set around the MCU’s 2025 Christmas holiday.

![Image 8](https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/secret-invasion-trailer-2-5.jpg?quality=82&strip=all)Image source: Marvel Studios
With all that in mind, it’s likely that [_Quantumania_ takes place at some point in 2026](https://bgr.com/entertainment/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumanias-place-on-the-mcu-timeline-is-finally-revealed/). Therefore, _Secret Invasion_ present-day is also some time in 2026. We don’t have a better estimate than that, but we’ll get more details in the not-too-distant future.

_The Marvels_ premieres in November and will be tied to _Secret Invasion_.

As I routinely explain, it’s important to know the placement of each standalone MCU story on the timeline, especially relative to _Endgame_. This detail is all the more important for _Secret Invasion_ to work.

This isn’t the Nick Fury you know
---------------------------------

One of the important _Secret Invasion_ plot details concerns Nick Fury. This isn’t the same guy we’ve grown to love. He’s a super spy who would have no problem dealing with a Skrull invasion during his glory days. Thanos (Josh Brolin) attacking Earth in _Infinity War_ and _Endgame_ really messed with Fury’s mind.

Fury died in _Infinity War_ only to come back to life five years later and discover that two of his closest allies had died. That’s Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), of course. Also, Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has disappeared.

Rather than facing that reality as a top spy, Agent Fury chose to move to space, where he’s building SABRE, Earth’s most advanced defense system. We know that much from _Secret Invasion_.

![Image 9: Sonya Falsworth (Olivia Colman) in Secret Invasion trailer.](https://bgr.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/secret-invasion-trailer-2-8.jpg?quality=82&strip=all)

Fury has been up there at least since _Spider-Man: Far From Home_, which takes place in the summer of 2024. As a reminder, the Avengers headquarters battle in _Endgame_ happens in October 2023.

Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) called Fury to help with the new threat from the Skrulls. But even so, she still has a bone to pick with her former ally and friend, for not keeping in touch all these years. She knows he hasn’t been the same since Thanos, and worries about his ability to fight this secret battle.

It turns out her worries, that others might get hurt, are warranted. Hill dies at the end of _Secret Invasion_ episode 1, with Gravik (Kingsley Ben-Adir) posing as Fury to kill her.

To sum it all up, Fury has been off-world for nearly three years. As soon as he returned, someone dear to him had just died. It sounds like it’s time for Nick to patch himself up and get back to work.

_Secret Invasion_ episode 2 will be available to stream online next week on [Disney Plus](https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/256585/564546/9358?subId1=BGR--&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2F&subId3=xid:fr1690555478590bbi).
