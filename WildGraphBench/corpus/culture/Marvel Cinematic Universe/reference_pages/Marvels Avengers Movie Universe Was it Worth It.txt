Marvel’s ‘Avengers’ Movie Universe: Was it Worth It?

_**[The Avengers](http://www.screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers/)**_ is officially a [record-shattering box office success](http://screenrant.com/avengers-box-office-second-weekend-billion-rob-171391/)-a film revered by millions of fans that even managed to impress a lot of those ‘snobby critics’ out there. Here at Screen Rant we gave the film a [4.5 out of 5 star review](http://screenrant.com/the-avengers-reviews-2012-kofi-168793/), and filled over an hour and a half of our [_Avengers_ Podcast Special](http://screenrant.com/the-avengers-podcast-screen-rant-underground-episode-37-benk-169774/)with glowing praise for writer/director Joss Whedon’s blockbuster Marvel superhero team-up.No doubt about it: _Avengers_ is a monumental success on many levels.

However, it’s important to remember the road that led to _The Avengers_ as Marvel Studios enters the next phase of its shared movie universe, in the build up to**_[The Avengers 2](http://www.screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers-2/)_**. A few years ago, we posed the question of whether the road to _Avengers_ was being paved [at the expense of the solo character films](http://screenrant.com/the-avengers-movie-discussion-kofi-47707/). Now that _Avengers_ is here, we once again have to ask ourselves: was the big payoff worth the comprises in storytelling it took to get there?

To be clear: we’re not going to debate the quality of _The Avengers_ _._ Us giving the film a good review obviously says that we thought Joss Whedon and company did a good job. What we _will_ do here is look back at _**Iron Man**_, _**The****Incredible Hulk**_, _**Iron Man 2**_, _**Thor**_ and _**Captain America**_, and identify which elements of those films were crucial to the story of _The Avengers_, and if each solo film was well-served by its inclusion in (and obligations to) a larger cinematic universe.

_Iron Man_

[Our Review Score: 4.5 out of 5](http://screenrant.com/review-iron-man-vic-1558/)

#### **_Avengers_ Contributions: Iron Man origin / Arc reactor creation / S.H.I.E.L.D. Introduction /Avengers Initiative**

_[Iron Man](http://www.screenrant.com/tag/iron-man/)_ was the film that started it all. By earning a worldwide total of $585 million, it proved that even second-tier Marvel superheroes (i.e., not Spider-Man or Wolverine) had legitimate box office appeal. _Iron Man_ also proved that Marvel Studios was indeed the best place for these heroes to be adapted for the big screen – in full accordance with their source material origins and mythos – instead of being tinkered with and altered, as some third-party studios had done (see: Fox’s (mis-)handling of the _[X-Men](http://www.screenrant.com/tag/x-men/)_ movie franchise).

Of course, being released so early in the game – when Marvel’s plan to build a cinematic universe was largely still a gamble married to a pipe dream – _Iron Man_ was free from some of the pressures that its followers (including its own sequel) would inevitably face. After all, the most direct connections between _IM_ and _The Avengers_ are S.H.I.E.L.D. Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) and the brief post-credits ”button scene,” which revealed [Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nyjwkav3h_0) – more of a fun nod to fans than the obligatory weaving of a larger mythos.

![Image 9: Iron Man (2008) Avengers Discussion](http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/themes/screenrantv6/images/bk_sidenav.png)
Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) sets The Avengers initiative in motion.

In the end, _Iron Man_ was mostly left free to tell its own story: How an arrogant arms dealer is nearly destroyed by his own hubris, and must learn to use his talents for a greater good. As a standalone narrative it’s complete and well-developed – even though it didn’t even have a fully-formed script as it entered production. Thanks to star Robert Downey Jr.’s charisma and his ability to successfully collaborate with director Jon Favreau, _Iron Man_ was more than just a solid story: It was a fun introduction to the Marvel Movie Universe.

**Verdict: Since it didn’t have a lot of _Avengers_ obligations to fulfill, _Iron Man_ was able to stand strong on its own mechanical legs.**

I loved this article. Great points. In the end, though mistakes were made, I wouldn’t change a thing. We’ve got the childhood Avengers dream on screen. Well… I might’ve changed a bit of IM2.

Here’s a question…

If the Masters of Evil were used, which members?

 Obviously Zemo, but who else?

Did anybody else notice the copy paste mentality of IM & TIH? IM’s adversary was a bigger iron man, TiH’s adversary was a bigger Hulk, then they went the numbers route in IM2 with multiple iron men soldiers! I was expecting an army of Hulks for TIH2, but thankfully that didn’t happen.

 At least they got their act together in the later movies although I thought Thor’s earthbound story to be very weak, like it was budget constrained, anyone else feel like that? Loved them all in their own way though, just for being up there ![Image 13: Iron Man (2008) Avengers Discussion](http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/themes/screenrantv6/images/bk_sidenav.png)

well if by the “Multiple iron man soldiers” you mean War Machine then War Machine is a Marvel Character. It was i guess expected to happen.

In my opinion Iron Man 2 was a bit… feeble.

They’re gonna have a hard time going back to the standalone movies as everyone wants to see Avengers 2 now as soon as possible. Plus: People WANT to see even more Marvel characters thrown into the mix. And I’m not talking about Antman or Wasp…I’m talking about major, well-established icons such as Spider-Man and Wolverine! With Disney/Marvel refusing to buy back these characters any time soon, lots of people will be disappointed.

A very detailed and thought – provoking article. Many points I agree with more than others.

I’ve always felt the 1st Iron Man was more good than great. A strong typical ‘origin’ story was undermined by a lack of danger and an all too brisk climax. Along with Downey Jnr’s relevation, much of appeal was that it showed that you comic book films can be fun and light hearted, but still have a serious tone without being cheesey (like Fantastic Four). In the minority here , but I thought IM2 was superior, having more of the same beats as the original but to a greater level. But yes, a huge chunk of it was tying to the Avengers and the movie did suffer a bit as a result.

The Incredible Hulk has good action and effects, but still felt generic and insubstantial. Lacking the depth and intelligence of Ang Lee’s film – it still displayed to date – post Avengers – the best rendition of the Hulk, lean , menacing and more athletic.

 Thor was an excellent movie, but i agree that the character had a much more expansive story that wasn’t exploited enough. I’ve always reckoned at least 75% of the movie should’ve taken place in Asgard and played more on the planet’s mythology and magic. To be fair thought, Thor is not a regular superhero and his story wasn’t as easy to translate as Iron Man was. You can’t blame Marvel for playing it safe to an extent, but now Thor 2 has the chance to more grander in scale. That’s part of the beauty that Avengers has achieved , opening up greater possibilities for these characters.

For me Captain America was actually the weakest of the films. Not because it was bad, but because it was a bit underwhelming. When Rogers becomes Captain America it should be a signature moment – but the pace moves too quickly at times – and we never got to savour the hero himself or how amazing his abilities really were.

But overall, yes whilst having to have some tie in to Avengers 2 – Marvel must ensure it concentrates on the individual characters’ stories first. This will make for better movies , which will in turn guarantee even further the success of Avengers 2.

Smike, do you realize how much money it would cost to buy back spider-man and wolverine? just those 2 alone would be billions just because spider-man is starting a new series and wolverine 2 is ready to shoot as soon as jackman is done with les mis. i would love to see spider-man in the shared marvel universe but its just not gonna happen.

For me, the only thing I’d do differently is let Thor and Captain America have 2 movies each, especially Captain America.

Thor needed it less, so I’ll just focus on Cap. Basically, I just felt like Cap getting frozen happened too early in his career. He was involved in a couple battles, though the montage thing made them seem completely unimportant, then he fought Red Skull once, and then he was frozen. It would have been better for him to have a longer war career, give him time to become a real, seasoned leader.

In the Avengers, he still felt like a kid from the Bronx, not the kind of guy who could really lead a team consisting of a god and a giant green monster. Part of this had to do with casting; don’t get me wrong, I think Evans did a good job with the material, but he just looks to young. But the problems were compounded by the fact that we never saw him do anything. He never even punched any Nazis!

And Thor went from Arrogant to Humble literally overnight.

I understand why they only got one film each, they were both untested properties and the plan was always to make the Avengers movie as soon as possible, but I still think the characters could have been fleshed out better if they each got two films, like Iron Man did.

@Jbrose…good points coming from you. Actually, i felt evans was too young to play cap myself. Marvel could have gone with someone a bit older in the face with a muscular frame that can easily been seen through the suit. I actually liked Cap’s movie, but would have preferred him wearing the suit he wore in the solo film for the Avengers movie, than the one he wore in TA. Out of the 4 Marvel movies that preceeded the Avengers, Thor’s movie was the only I rated the lowest. Screenrant gave it a 4 out of 5, but I gave it a 3. His movie and Cap’s movie felt rushed to me. However, they seemed to have been movies soley for the purpose of introduing these two characters, as these two films were the last 2 films before the Avengers. Hulk 2008 was excelent. It was way better than ang lee’s 2003 version, because of its great story and plot. For the record, i liked Norton’s banner better, and would have liked to see him playing the role in the Avengers, just for continuity. Iron Man 1 was good. And I have to say i did like Iron Man 2. Nuff Said.

Only thing I’d have done differently was Iron Man 2 but that’s easy to say now. I think instead of an Iron Man 2 sequel they should have just done the first S.H.I.E.L.D. movie and have RDJr be a major star as Tony Stark in that movie as well.

But ah well! Hindsight is 20/20.

Overrated.

I’m waiting for ‘Amazing Spider-man” and ‘DKR”.

 Even ‘X-men: First Class’ was a far superior movie than ‘Avengers’.

Dare I say that you are probably the only one on the planet that thinks XMFC was “far superior” to The Avengers. At the very least Avengers didn’t have to completely pillage and gut the X-Men canon to get the movie to work ![Image 25: Iron Man (2008) Avengers Discussion](http://cdn.screenrant.com/wp-content/themes/screenrantv6/images/bk_sidenav.png)

Marvel Studios should introduce Black Panther in Cap 2. The sequel could have a ‘You Only Live Twice’ vibe whereby Cap is sent to Africa to help prevent Crossbones, Sin, and Klaw from invading Wakanda. The screenplay could be based upon both ‘Who Is The Black Panther?’ and the ‘Flags Of Our Fathers’ mini-series.

It would be a welcome break from a New York City backlot that have become trite in action movies like Transformers, Battle: L.A., and the third act of every Marvel movie since Spider-Man.

This is a great idea but only if a solo BP movie follows. And yeah, they need some new locales, and why does everything just happen to happen in NYC?

Cap 2 could include grainy WWII flashbacks when a still inexperienced Steve Rogers first encountered (and fought) T’Challa’s grandfather. Hell, they could even throw in the Howling Commandos for good measure.

Adding Wolverine and Spiderman is what most fans of the Avengers wants, but the only way it could happen is if Marvel makes a deal with Fox and Sony Pictures. Fans should write all three of these studios and tell them to work together for AVENGERS 2. Petition.

“Louis Leterrier’s retooled version of the jade giant did score major points with Marvel’s primary base (fanboys), and offered more irrefutable proof that Marvel could adapt its characters for the screen better than some third-party studio ever could.”

Exactly. However, you referred to The Incredible Hulk as a “so-so” film. Was it because it did about the same (in revenue) as ang lee’s horrible version? The story and plot of the 2008 film were excellent, and made sense. Was it not screnrant who reported that ed norton’s “feud” with Marvel may have resulted in the film’s, although revenue turning, lack of an even bigger take at the box office? So much so, that Norton, according to screenrant, refused to promote the movie. Nevertheless, The Incredible Hulk, out of the 4 marvel avengers-preceeding-films is one of the best, next to iron man 1, and that’s it (not that the other 2, Cap and thor, were bad because they weren’t). Of course that’s my opinion.

“Louis Leterrier’s retooled version of the jade giant did score major points with Marvel’s primary base (fanboys), and offered more irrefutable proof that Marvel could adapt its characters for the screen better than some third-party studio ever could.”

The words in quotes above is what Kofi said in the article that starts this page. However, what I believe is of prime importance as it pertains to this post to you is the “B” clause in Kofi’s statement, which begins with the word “and.” This is because you, a few days ago, said that marvel could not make a better film of the X-men than Fox. So much for that.

Does anyone know how it works with movie rights? Can Fox and Sony keep making X-Men and Spider-Man films forever or do the rights revert back at some point in the future?

It used to be that film rights lasted forever and studios didn’t need to worry about them expiring. However that was amended a few years back so that the rights expire after a couple of years IF the character in question isn’t being used by the film studio in some way, as in they don’t have a movie with the character in it in the works. Its because of this change that Sony is doing this reboot of Spider-Man and why Fox is doing a Wolverine sequel, so that the rights don’t revert back to Marvel. So, until these studios decide they don’t want to keep making movies based on these characters anymore(which is probably never going to happen because there’s so much money to be made on them) or if Disney and Marvel decide to buyback the rights from these studios (which definitely won’t happen because that would cost billions of dollars to do.) the answers is sadly no, Marvel is not getting the rights to Spider-Man or Wolverine back anytime soon.

Fox and Sony have to make a Spider-man and X-men related movie every few years or the rights immediately move back to Marvel. But the only way I see Marvel studios getting them back is if the next few Spider-man and X-men movies stink and they lose money.

Wait a minute I started visiting screenrant.com back in 2010 I clearly remember you guys giving Iron Man2 a 4 out of 5. Upon further viewings did you guys change the score?

I have to say I enjoyed Ang Lee’s Hulk, after going to the Marvel movie database and reading the history of the character, not being an avid comic book reader. It was interesting to note all the things which were included in Lee’s version.

The genetic anomaly in his blood which allowed him to survive the gamma radiation was the most interesting point, although the introduction of the nano-meds was probably not necessary to his survival, however as a plot point (in this case research) it was a good reason to be using gamma rays to cause damage.

I didn’t like the montage at the beginning of The Incredible Hulk which suggested a link to the TV show. Banner’s analogy in that assumed that greater gamma ray output on certain days gave people unusual strength in emotional situations. In reality pumping all those rad’s of gamma into his noggin would have most likely killed him. I don’t recall any mention of his genetic anomaly to explain why he didn’t die of radiation poisoning.

I did feel that Lee focused too much on things like moss growing on rocks, since when is Hulk that contemplative and deep? It’s also been suggested that he “grew” to large, probably a valid point, keeping his size down probably would have been a good idea. I did like the design of Hulk as opposed to TIH but visually I guess that’s subjective. I did enjoy Bana as Banner, wasn’t a fan of Norton’s version but Mark Ruffalo would have to be the best Banner so far, very likable and fits the part really well.

Josh Lucas was a great antagonist for Banner in Hulk, Nick Nolte was also terrific as Banner’s father.

Also having Desert Base as a location was good as it was also from the database.

But in the end I think the two films complement each other in a way as they both have elements from the origin’s.
