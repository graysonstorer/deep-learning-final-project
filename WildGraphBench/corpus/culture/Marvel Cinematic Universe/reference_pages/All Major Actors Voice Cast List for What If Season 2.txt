Reprising his role from _What If…?_ Season 1, Jeffrey Wright again plays The Watcher, a cosmic entity with an oath of non-interference. Towards the end of Season 1, The Watcher broke that oath to form the Guardians of the Multiverse to stop the AI Ultron when he got ahold of the Infinity Stones.

Wright is a decorated actor known for his roles as Jim Gordon in 2022’s _The Batman_, Felix Leiter in the Daniel Craig-era James Bond movies, and other projects such as _Boardwalk Empire_, a deeply underrated series you should watch.

### Cynthia McWilliams Plays Gamora

Played in the Marvel Cinematic Universe by Zoe Saldana (with Ariana Greenblatt playing a younger version of the character), Cynthia McWilliams voices Gamora in _What If…?_ Season 2. Gamora is the adopted daughter of Thanos and a formidable warrior that eventually joins up with the Guardians of the Galaxy.

McWilliams has had roles on such shows as _Prison Break_, where she played Detective Kacee Franklin; and _Bosch_, where she played Detective Joan Bennett. Otherwise, you may recognize her as the voice of Vicki Vale and several other characters in _Merry Little Batman_ or Senna from _League of Legends_.

### Mick Wingert Plays Tony Stark

![Image 3: Tony Stark AKA Iron Man in Marvel Studios' What If...? as part of an article on all the major actors and cast list for Season 2.](https://web.archive.org/web/20241222181402im_/https://www.escapistmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/ts.jpg?w=1024&resize=1186%2C667)
While Robert Downey Jr. may have played Tony Stark, AKA Iron Man, in the MCU, in _What If…?_ he’s played by Mick Wingert. A billionaire industrialist, Stark creates his own suit of special armor, which he uses to fight bad guys. He was a mainstay of the MCU from 2008’s _Iron Man_ until his death in 2019’s _Avengers: Endgame_.

Wingert who has also played roles in such projects as _Kung Fu Panda 3_ and _The Cuphead Show!_. He’s played Stark in a lot of different shows, though, and is one of his main voice actors. He’s also had a strong voice acting career, having most recently appeared as the Talking Flower in _Super Mario Bros. Wonder_ after having been [rumored to play the titular plumber himself](https://web.archive.org/web/20241222181402/https://www.escapistmagazine.com/mario-and-luigis-new-voice-actor-in-super-mario-bros-wonder-has-finally-been-revealed/).

### Hayley Atwell Returns as Peggy Carter

![Image 4: Peggy Carter AKA Captain Carter in Marvel Studios' What If...? as part of an article on all the major actors and cast list for Season 2.](https://web.archive.org/web/20241222181402im_/https://www.escapistmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/pc.jpg?w=1024&resize=1200%2C675)
Reprising the role she originated in 2011’s _Captain America: The First Avenger_, Hayley Atwell returns as an alternate version of Peggy Carter who received the Super-Soldier Serum instead of Steve Rogers. This led to her becoming Captain Carter, who has been one of the main fixtures of _What If…?_ and played an important role in the first season, helping the Guardians of the Multiverse stopping Ultron.

Outside of her performances both in live-action and animation, Atwell is known for her roles in such projects as _Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One_ and _The Pillars of Earth_. She’s also the voice actor for [Lara Croft in the upcoming _Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft_](https://web.archive.org/web/20241222181402/https://www.escapistmagazine.com/netflix-first-look-tomb-raider-anime/).

### Lake Bell Plays Natasha Romanoff

![Image 5: Black Widow in What If](https://web.archive.org/web/20241222181402im_/https://www.escapistmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/bw.jpg?w=1024&resize=1200%2C675)
Natasha Romanoff, AKA Black Widow, was one of the MCU’s longest-standing characters prior to her death in 2019’s _Avengers: Endgame_. Trained by the secretive Red Room, Romanoff is a master fighter and a spy. Despite not having superpowers of her own, she’s fought alongside the Avengers and proven herself time and time again a valuable ally.

Although Scarlett Johansson played Black Widow in the MCU, she’s played by Lake Bell in _What If…?_. If you’re a fan of comic book media, you’ll recognize her as the voice of Poison Ivy in _Harley Quinn_. She also appeared in the live-action MCU as Dr. Graham in 2022’s _Black Panther: Wakanda Forever_.

### Josh Keaton Plays Steve Rogers

![Image 6: Steve Rogers in What If.](https://web.archive.org/web/20241222181402im_/https://www.escapistmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/sr.jpg?w=1024&resize=1200%2C675)
One of the MCU’s most important heroes, Steve Rogers gained superpowers during World War II thanks to the Super-Soldier Serum. Only, what if he didn’t? In _What If…?_, Rogers has served a lot of different roles, including as HYDRA Stomper and President of the United States instead of as a super soldier. He’s set to return in _What If…?_ Season 2 alongside Peggy Carter.

Despite Chris Evans playing Rogers in live-action, Josh Keaton voices him in Season 2, as he did in Season 1. Keaton is a prolific voice actor and you’ll likely recognize him as the voice of Scott Lang, AKA Ant-Man, in the animated _Guardians of the Galaxy_ cartoon or as Revolver Ocelot in _Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater_.

### Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer

![Image 7: Justin Hammer in Marvel's What If..?](https://web.archive.org/web/20241222181402im_/https://www.escapistmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Justin-Hammer-Marvels-What-If.jpg?w=1024&resize=1200%2C675)
The main antagonist of 2010’s _Iron Man 2_,[Justin Hammer returns in _What If…?_ Season 2](https://web.archive.org/web/20241222181402/https://www.escapistmagazine.com/what-if-season-2-trailer-reveals-a-big-justin-hammer-twist/), and he gets an Iron Man suit of his own. In the MCU, Hammer is the CEO of Hammer Industries, a rival of Stark Industries. The film saw him recruiting Ivan Vanko, AKA Whiplash, to create the same Arc Reactor technology that Stark used to power his suit.

Sam Rockwell reprises his role as Hammer in the MCU. He’s definitely a recognizable face, and there’s a good chance you’ve seen him in either 1999’s _Galaxy Quest_, 2017’s _Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri_ or in 2019’s _Jojo Rabbit_.

### Elizabeth Olsen Returns as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch

![Image 8: Scarlet Witch in What If as part of an article on the major actors and cast list for Season 2.](https://web.archive.org/web/20241222181402im_/https://www.escapistmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/sw.jpg?w=1024&resize=1200%2C675)
Wanda Maximoff debuted in 2014’s _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_ and served briefly as a villain before becoming a key hero in the MCU. Unfortunately, the events of _WandaVision_ led to her again becoming an antagonist in _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_, which she seemingly perished at the end of. However, while Maximoff may be gone, she’s not forgotten, and she’ll have a role to play in _What If…?_ Season 2.

Actor Elizabeth Olsen once again plays Scarlet Witch in _What If…?_ Season 2. If you’re watching _What If…?_ Season 2, you almost certainly know Olsen from at least one other time that she’s played Maximoff, so I’m not going into her other credits here.
