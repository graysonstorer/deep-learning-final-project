To celebrate International Women's Day, Marvel and Disney+ released a new four-part mini-series called "MPower," which highlights the stories, creation, and impact of some of the most empowering figures in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The episodes are centered around [the women of Wakanda](https://www.slashfilm.com/1098093/black-panther-wakanda-forever-is-all-about-the-women-of-wakanda/), Captain Marvel and the women she inspires (Monica Rambeau [and Kamala Khan](https://www.slashfilm.com/926654/ms-marvel-is-the-rare-marvel-show-that-justified-not-being-a-movie/)), Scarlet Witch and the other women of "WandaVision," and the women of Guardians of the Galaxy. The series utilizes scenes from the films and related Disney+ series, archival footage, interviews with the stars and creative team members that helped bring the characters to life, and stunning original animation. The series is not just a celebration of the characters and how they've brought success to the MCU, but also a deeply intimate look at how the actors who play these characters connect with their stories.

"Every hero has an epic origin story and so does this series," said executive producer Justin W. Hochberg in a statement. "When I conceived 'MPower,' I did it out of love for my teen daughter so she would have more icons to look up to, voices to learn from, and role models to help her impact the world. Today, that vision is now a reality thanks to Brie Larson, Elizabeth Olsen, the women of Wakanda, and, Zoë Saldaña, whose leadership was 'Mpowering.'"

Saldaña serves as an executive producer on the series, in addition to appearing in episode 4. "MPower is a tribute to women's representation and empowerment," she was quoted as saying in the statement. "We're enthused to have the involvement of a diverse group of women whose voices and stories will serve as a source of inspiration. Our hope is that this series will ignite meaningful conversations and drive real change towards a more equal and inclusive world."

More than just gender equality

"MPower" does a fantastic job at highlighting the women behind the camera that help bring the MCU to greatness. Creative team members like [Academy Award-winning costume designer Ruth E. Carter](https://www.slashfilm.com/563884/ruth-carter-interview/), Marvel executive Trinh Tran, production designer Hannah Beachler, and editor Debbie Berman appear to talk about the way women have had a monumental impact on MCU films. The films and shows that fans across the globe love so much would not be possible without the contributions of a diverse group of women, and it's fantastic to see such a thoughtful and in-depth spotlight on their work.

Equally as impressive is how deep the series is willing to go in analyzing the impact of the work. This isn't a superhero sizzle reel of cool moments, it's a sincere assessment of why these stores are important beyond gender representation. The episode on "Black Panther," for example, highlights what Lupita Nyong'o calls "a nostalgia that never was," a reference to the fantasy of Wakanda, the only African nation untouched by colonization. "Black Panther" is a celebration of Black excellence, and in our current era where whiny pissbabies cry about "wokeness" whenever anything popular dares to center a story on a marginalized group, it's refreshing to see Marvel and Disney+ unapologetically embrace the Blackness of the film.

Similarly, the episode on Scarlet Witch isn't just about how Wanda Maximoff is a strong and impressive hero, it's a look at the way themes of mental illness and trauma recovery can make people feel less alone in the world. The episode on "Guardians of the Galaxy" naturally dissects the sisterhood and sibling rivalry of Gamora and Nebula, and the "Captain Marvel" episode serves as a reminder that the best way to build community is to lift one another up.

Don't let this miniseries fall by the wayside. All four episodes are available to stream now on Disney+.
