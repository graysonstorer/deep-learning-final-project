You would not like him when he’s angry.

Lou Ferrigno on Friday night randomly tweeted out a shot at the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/marvel-cinematic-universe/).

The award-winning bodybuilder and actor commented on his starring in the popular ’70s-’80s television series, _The Incredible Hulk_, noting that he did not spot a costume or need CGI muscles.

“Can’t think of another superhero that isn’t in costume or CGI. Worked damn hard on my diet and exercise for the Hulk. Wasn’t going to let anyone down. The hulk was my hero as a kid as well Thumbs up #hulkseries #oghulk #nocgiinvolved #dietandexercise #louferrigno #dontmakemeangry,” Ferrigno tweeted with a picture of himself as the Hulk.

Some fans were taken aback by the random message, but most told the beloved actor he was their only Hulk.

Ferrigno played Hulk opposite Bill Bixby’s Dr. David Bruce Banner on the classic CBS series that ran for five seasons from 1978 to 1982.

When [Hulk appeared on the big screen](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/eric-bana-hulk-1234954990/) for the first time in 2003, the Marvel character was total CGI. [Eric Bana](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/eric-bana-0/) played Bruce Banner. From there, Banner was played by [Edward Norton](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/edward-norton/) in 2008 and then Mark Ruffalo. However, Ferrigno appeared in a cameo for Norton’s _The Incredible Hulk_ and provided the Hulk’s voice in that film.

### Do Not Sell My Personal Information

This page enables California residents to opt-out of sharing of information that may be a sale of personal information under the CCPA. Please review all of your choices below. You can also review our [Privacy Policy.](https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#california)

**Contact Information & Subscription Information**

 We sell or license certain information, such as contact information or subscription information, to third parties to provide you with offers and promotions and opportunities that may be of interest to you. If you would like to opt out of the sale of this information, please use this [webform](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/e65b3c4c-fa81-40d2-9df0-c7e99bf5f900/433ac076-21f3-4342-b391-a4d7d631cd3f.html) or call our automated line at (877) 365-3500.

**Opt Out of Advertising Cookies**

 PMC and our advertising partners use cookies and other technologies to collect and share certain information such as your usage activity to deliver ads that are more relevant to you on PMC and other sites or apps. This may be considered a "sale” under the CCPA. You can opt out of this type of sharing by us using the toggle above. When the toggle is enabled, targeted advertising cookies are on. This opt out does not affect other cookies such as strictly necessary or essential cookies. For more information about cookies please see our [Privacy Policy](https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#california).

 You must exercise this choice every PMC site and on each device and browser where you want your choice to apply. If you clear cookies, you must opt out again. You may still receive ads from us (including contextual or based on our own data about you). We will still share some information with those of our partners who function as our service providers, such as to help us measure ad effectiveness, control the frequency, delivery and security of ads, and conduct analytics. This will not opt you out of the use of previously collected and shared information or all interest-based advertising (such as that conducted on other sites). 

 You can also update your browser settings or visit www.aboutads.info/choices to opt-out of certain uses of cookies for advertising purposes. 

 Our downstream partners who are not service providers may re-sell this information. You can request to opt out of such activity by clicking [here](https://www.iabprivacy.com/optout.html) to see a list of participants in the IAB (some of which are our partners) and submitting an opt out request on each entity’s site. Even if you opt out through this link, you will still see ads.

#### Sale of Personal Data

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information to third parties. These cookies collect information for analytics and to personalize your experience with targeted ads. You may exercise your right to opt out of the sale of personal information by using this toggle switch. If you opt out we will not be able to offer you personalised ads and will not hand over your personal information to any third parties. Additionally, you may contact our legal department for further clarification about your rights as a California consumer by using this Exercise My Rights link.

If you have enabled privacy controls on your browser (such as a plugin), we have to take that as a valid request to opt-out. Therefore we would not be able to track your activity through the web. This may affect our ability to personalize ads according to your preferences.
