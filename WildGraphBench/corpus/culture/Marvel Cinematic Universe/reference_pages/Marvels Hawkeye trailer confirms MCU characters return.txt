### Big Shot Official Trailer Disney+

01:54

[Marvel](https://www.digitalspy.com/marvel/) has released a new teaser for _[Hawkeye](https://www.digitalspy.com/hawkeye/)_, which will debut next month, teasing the return of a Marvel Cinematic Universe character that we have't seen in a while.

In the trailer, we see a fleeting glimpse of Linda Cardellini, who plays Clint's wife Laura Barton. The character showed up in _Avengers: Age of Ultron_ and _[Avengers: Endgame](https://www.digitalspy.com/the-avengers/)_ but we haven't seen her since, and fans were confused when she wasn't in the first trailer that dropped last month.

But, now, there is confirmation that she will return as Laura, though we don't know how big a role she will play in the show.

The teaser shows Hawkeye seeing an _Avengers_-themed musical on Broadway, after which he is attacked by some unknown enemies.

_Hawkeye_ will see Jeremy Renner reprise his role as the arrow-slinging superhero we know and love. He will be introduced to new character Kate Bishop, who will be played by [_Dickinson_'s](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a35554731/dickinson-season-2-hailee-steinfeld-invisible-twist/) Hailee Steinfeld, who is described as "equally as annoying as she is charismatic".

The character of Bishop was introduced in the _Young Avengers_ comics, and will now join Disney+'s fourth live-action Marvel series.

Bishop "will bring about a slew of problems that Barton will then have to wrestle with," the synopsis describes.

The show was teased in one of Marvel's iconic post-credits scene following _[Black Widow](https://www.digitalspy.com/black-widow/)_, starring Scarlett Johansson.

Disney+ and Marvel have had extensive success with their superhero shows, including _[WandaVision](https://www.digitalspy.com/wandavision/)_, _[The Falcon and the Winter Soldier](https://www.digitalspy.com/falcon-and-the-winter-soldier/)_ and _[Loki](https://www.digitalspy.com/loki/)_, the latter of which has been formally renewed for a second season.

Marvel recently released _[Shang-Chi and The Legend Of The Ten Rings](https://www.digitalspy.com/shang-chi/)_ to great acclaim, and will be following that up with the theatrical release of _[The Eternals](https://www.digitalspy.com/eternals/)_, making this season a big one for Marvel.

**_Hawkeye_ will premiere on November 24 on [Disney+.](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X991730&xs=1&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fen-gb%2Fwelcome&sref=https%3A%2Fwww.digitalspy.com%2Ftv%2Fustv%2Fa37963901%2Fmarvel-hawkeye-trailer-laura-barton-return%2F&xcust=%5Butm_source%7C%5Butm_campaign%7C%5Butm_medium%7C%5Bgclid%7C%5Bmsclkid%7C%5Bfbclid%7C%5Brefdomain%7Cwww.google.com%5Bcontent_id%7Cccb1bb8a-9790-49c2-a045-b34b31da9e1a%5Bcontent_product_id%7C%5Bproduct_retailer_id%7C)**
