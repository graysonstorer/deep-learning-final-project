# Daredevil & All Marvel Crossovers: Every Character In Multiple Shows

**WARNING: This contains spoilers for all _The Defenders_ shows.**

[_**Daredevil**_](https://screenrant.com/tag/daredevil) and all of the Marvel shows previously on Netflix are now streaming on Disney+, allowing viewers to see how[_T_](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-defenders)[_he Defender_](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-defenders)[_s_](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-defenders) universe had connectivity comparable to the one in the MCU. Starting in 2015 with _Daredevil_, Marvel's Netflix shows quickly evolved into a shared universe made of six shows, multiple seasons, and countless characters. The last entry in that universe was _Daredevil_ season 3, released in October 2018.

Ever since _Daredevil_ season 1 was released on Netflix, audiences have been wondering whether those shows are effectively canon to the MCU. Although there hasn't been a completely solid answer on this matter, characters like Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk have finally started to pop up in the MCU.

Those discussions will be reignited now that [Netflix's Marvel shows moved to Disney+](https://screenrant.com/marvel-netflix-disneyplus-mcu-series-rotten-tomatoes-ranked/). While Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and The Punisher are the most well-known names in _T_ _he Defenders_ universe, Netflix's Marvel series has managed to make viewers care about many of the supporting characters. Even with several names from the comics and also original characters appearing in each show, the shows have always found space for crossovers. Here's a rundown of all the characters that have appeared in crossovers with other shows in _Th_ _e Defenders_ universe.

Matthew Murdock / Daredevil
---------------------------

Daredevil was the character that started the Netflix universe of Marvel characters. If _The Defenders_' pocket universe were to be compared to the MCU, then Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock was just as important to those shows as [Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark](https://screenrant.com/ironheart-iron-man-tony-stark-rdj-return-jarvis/) was to the movies. _Daredevil_ season 1 sees _Daredevil_ already in action and making a name for himself in Hell's Kitchen. While flashbacks showed a lot of Matt and Foggy's backstory - to the point where many viewers may feel like they've known the characters for a long time -_Daredevil_ season 1 wasn't an origin story, and already placed the audience right in the middle of the action. _Daredevil_ season 2 would see the more realistic threats from the previous season give way to the mysterious Hand, its soldiers, and the Black Sky. It is through this more mystical plotline that Matt Murdock was integrated into [the story of _The Defenders_](https://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-2-defenders-team-professor-x-setup/), the crossover series that brought together Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, and Iron Fist. Initially acting only as Jessica Jones' lawyer, Matt Murdock realized that there were more dangers to the story than he had realized and found himself forced to put on the Daredevil mask again. Matt would return for _Daredevil_ season 3 picking up where things left off in _The Defenders_.

Jessica Jones
-------------

The second character in that universe to have a series, Krysten Ritter's Jessica Jones didn't necessarily want to answer the call to the hero's journey. Introduced as a private investigator capable of uncovering anyone's dirt, Jessica Jones was hiding special abilities she received as a result of an experiment. Jones used her powers to get information that no one else could, and that was put to good use by one of her most loyal clients, attorney Jeri Hogarth. [After _Jessica Jones_ season 1](https://screenrant.com/jessica-jones-season-1-recap/), the character would jump right into the crossover series _The Defenders_. Initially following the trail of what appeared to be a common case, Jessica Jones ended up tangling with the Hand's conspiracy by finding a series of explosives and bumping into Elektra Natchios. Jessica would then be arrested by Misty Knight and meet her lawyer Matt Murdock.

Luke Cage
---------

Formerly known as Carl Lucas, Luke Cage was introduced in _[Jessica Jones](https://screenrant.com/tag/jessica-jones)_ season 1 as Jessica's love interest. However, the character played by Mike Colter would later discover the terrible truth that Jessica Jones had killed his wife, Reva Connors, who Luke believed had died in a bus accident. Luke would move to Harlem after the emotional roller coaster in _Jessica Jones_, and that would kick off [the story of _Luke Cage_ season 1](https://screenrant.com/captain-america-civil-war-luke-cage-alfre-woodard-role-theory/). The hero's first year of solo adventures would end with Luke Cage going back to prison to serve his original sentence, and the character would then be seen again in _The Defenders_. In the crossover series, Luke Cage was released from prison with the help of his lawyer Foggy Nelson, and soon after he found himself in the middle of the Hand's conspiracy while investigating the death of a person he knew. Luke Cage's story would then continue in _[Luke Cage](https://screenrant.com/tag/luke-cage)_ season 2.

Danny Rand / Iron Fist
----------------------

Danny Rand, aka the Immortal Iron Fist, received the classic superhero origin story in _[Iron Fist](https://screenrant.com/tag/iron-fist)_ season 1. Years after being presumed dead, Danny Rand returned to New York with years of martial arts experience and knowledge about the dangers of the Hand. [_Iron Fist_ would return](https://screenrant.com/iron-fist-season-2-replace-daredevil/) as an important part of _The Defenders_, a show that began precisely with him and Colleen facing Hand's cells all over the world only to discover that the organization's main move would take place in New York. It was on Defenders that Danny Rand met his long-time comic book companion Luke Cage, and the Immortal _Iron Fist_ would appear in _Luke Cage_ season 2, episode 10 before returning for _Iron Fist_ season 2.

Claire Temple
-------------

The Marvel universe on Netflix may have started with Matt, but it was Claire Temple who really connected all the shows. Except for _The Punisher_, Rosario Dawson's character has appeared in every series in the [Netflix Marvel Universe](https://screenrant.com/netflix-marvel-characters-not-join-mcu/). Introduced in _Daredevil_ season 1, episode 2, Claire used her skills as a nurse to patch an injured Matt Murdock up. Claire would return in _Jessica Jones_ season 1, episode 13, helping Jessica Jone _s_ and Luke Cage in the hospital. After appearing again in _Daredevil_ season 2, Claire would return to Harlem and reconnect with Luke Cage in _Luke Cage_ season 1. During Luke's imprisonment, Claire would appear in _Iron Fist_ season 1, in which she participated in six episodes as a martial arts student of Colleen's. Claire was also present throughout _The Defenders_. Clair's last appearance in the "Defendersverse" would be in _Luke Cage_ season 2.

Foggy Nelson
------------

Matt Murdock's best friend, Foggy Nelson, has been on the “Defendesverse” since _Daredevil_ season 1. After discovering that Matt was the Devil of Hell's Kitchen shortly before [_Daredevil_ defeated Kingpin](https://screenrant.com/daredevil-kingpin-deal-retcon-thanos-blip-explain/), Foggy's confidence in his friend was shaken, but he continued to work with Murdock in _Daredevil_ season 2. By the end of that season, Nelson & Murdock would cease to exist and Foggy would go after a job in a bigger company. That's how he appeared in _Jessica Jones_ season 1, which he was working on for Jeri Hoghart. He also appeared in one episode of _Luke Cage_ season 1 as Luke's attorney and six out of eight _The Defenders_’ episodes. _Daredevil_ season 3 would be the last appearance of the character played by Elden Henson.

Karen Page would also have a cameo in _The Punisher_ season 2 and return for _Daredevil_ season 3.

Elektra Natchios
----------------

One of the most important characters in the Marvel universe to appear in the "Defendersverse", Elektra Natchios was introduced in _Daredevil_ season 2, where she was played by Elodie Yung. While much of Elektra's origins and personality were changed in this version, at least the dynamic between her and Matt Murdock was there. Despite dying in _Daredevil_ season 2, Elektra would be resurrected to become the main villain in _The Defenders_.

Frank Castle / The Punisher
---------------------------

Jon Bernthal made his debut as the [Punisher in _Daredevil_ season 2](https://screenrant.com/daredevil-blacksmith-ray-schoonover-identity-punisher-explained/), in which he played a major role.

Colleen Wing
------------

Misty Knight
