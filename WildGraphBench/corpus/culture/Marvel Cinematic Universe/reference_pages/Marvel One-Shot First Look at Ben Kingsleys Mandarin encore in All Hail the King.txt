[FIRST LOOK: Marvel unveils top-secret 'Avengers' short film 'Item 47' -- EXCLUSIVE](http://insidemovies.ew.com/2012/07/03/first-look-item-47/)

_Beware, Iron Man 3 spoilers lie ahead …_

Trevor Slattery is ready for an encore. But it’s not always good to be the king.

Marvel’s latest One-Shot short film is aimed at a loose end: Ben Kingsley’s dim-witted Mandarin impersonator from _Iron Man 3_, who has been locked away in a maximum security prison and is reveling in his newfound infamy. (It’s as close to fame as he’s ever gotten.)

The 14-minute film _All Hail the King_ was written and directed by _Iron Man 3_ scribe Drew Pearce, and will be included on the _Thor: The Dark World_ Blu-ray, out Feb. 25. Entertainment Weekly has seen the movie and has the exclusive debut of four pictures from the short – plus details from Pearce about how it all came together.

The short is an epilogue to _Iron Man 3_ … but you could also see it as a possible prologue to _Iron Man 4_.

Each new film in the One-Shot series gets more elaborate than the last, and Marvel fans will be glad to know that _All Hail the King_ ups the ante again. Most recently, we saw Hayley Atwell as Captain America’s leading lady Peggy Carter, battling bad guys and bullying bosses in the short _Agent Carter_, released on the _Iron Man 3_ Blu-ray in September.

Before that, Lizzy Caplan and Jesse Bradford were a down-on-their-luck couple using a salvaged alien gun from _The Avengers_ to blast their way into bank vaults in _Item 47_. Both those previous films were directed by Marvel co-president Louis D’Esposito, and marked a step up from a smaller-scale pair of shorts on the original _Captain American_ and _Thor_ DVDs that focused on Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson.

_All Hail the King_ features the biggest One-Shot star yet – Kingsley, whose character is one of the most controversial in the Marvel universe: a brokedown British actor who was only pretending to be The Mandarin, the murderous and ominous leader of The Ten Rings terrorist group.

The Mandarin is _the_ classic Iron Man nemesis, and while some fans were amused by the curveball _Iron Man 3_ threw out there regarding his “true nature,” others were outraged and furious.

_All Hail the King_ reveals — they are not alone.

“Imagine a real terrorist organization whose beliefs were long held and religious for thousands of years, and imagine a drunk, British actor coming along and essentially telling the world that he’s the face of your organization,” Pearce tells EW. “I think they would be right to be quite angry.”
