David Giesbrecht/Netflix

[Krysten Ritter](https://web.archive.org/web/20250513211611/https://variety.com/t/krysten-ritter/) is officially back as hard-fighting, hard-drinking Marvel hero [Jessica Jones](https://web.archive.org/web/20250513211611/https://variety.com/t/jessica-jones/).

The announcement was made during Disney’s upfront presentation to advertisers in New York on Tuesday. Ritter took the stage with Charlie Cox, star of “Daredevil Born Again,” to reveal that she would be joining that show for its second season.

“It’s so great to be back, returning to Jessica after three seasons and ‘The Defenders’ and now joining the MCU,” Ritter said. “I’m so excited to bring back this iconic character, and without giving too much away, there is much more in store for Jessica Jones. This is going to be an incredible season!”

Ritter first played Jones in the self-titled Netflix series that debuted in 2015. “Jessica Jones” was one of five Marvel shows to air on Netflix, along with “Daredevil,” “Luke Cage,” “Iron First,” “The Punisher,” and the crossover series “The Defenders.” “Jessica Jones” ultimately aired for three seasons, with its final Netflix season airing in 2019. [It was canceled](https://web.archive.org/web/20250513211611/https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/the-punisher-jessica-jones-canceled-netflix-marvel-1203142166/), along with all the other Marvel-Netflix shows, when Disney initiated plans to air Marvel Cinematic Universe shows on Disney+.

### Popular on Variety

Ritter received widespread praise for her portrayal of the character, who has super strength and the ability to fly. After a brief but failed stint as a superhero, Jones began working as a private investigator in New York.

As [_Variety_ reported at the time](https://web.archive.org/web/20250513211611/https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/defenders-disney-streaming-daredevil-iron-fist-luke-cage-jessica-jones-1203087219/), part of the Netflix-Marvel deal included a provision which prevented the characters featured in the shows from appearing in any non-Netflix series or film for at least two years after cancellation.

Disney has already begun bringing the characters back, with “Daredevil: Born Again” starring Cox and Vincent D’Onofrio debuting on Disney+ in March 2025. Jon Bernthal also returned in that show as Frank Castle, a.k.a The Punisher, with Season 2 of “Born Again” already in the works.
