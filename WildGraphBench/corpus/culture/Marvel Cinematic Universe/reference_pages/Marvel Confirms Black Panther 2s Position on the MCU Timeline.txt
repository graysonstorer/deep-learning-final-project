Marvel Confirms Black Panther 2's Position on the MCU Timeline
==============================================================

By[Lee Freitag](https://www.cbr.com/author/lee-freitag/?_locale=en)

Published 5 hours ago

Disney+ updates its Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline order allowing fans to pinpoint exactly when Black Panther: Wakanda Forever takes place.

![Image 7: Black Panther cast](https://www.cbr.com/black-panther-2-mcu-timeline/)

Disney+ has revealed exactly where _[Black Panther: Wakanda Forever](https://www.cbr.com/tag/black-panther-wakanda-forever/)_ lands on the ever-expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline.

Per [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/10qo3re/disney_correctly_places_black_panther_wakanda/), the streaming service has placed _Wakanda Forever_ after _Moon Knight_ and before _She-Hulk: Attorney at Law_ in its Marvel Studios section called, "Marvel Cinematic Universe in Timeline Order." With _Moon Knight_ taking place after _Hawkeye_, which took place around Christmas 2024, and _She-Hulk_ being set during the summer of 2025, this means that the latest MCU movie is set in Spring 2025. _Wakanda Forever_ actually provides clues to this Spring 2025 setting in the film, with the clothing and foliage seeming to indicate Spring as well as Riri Williams' differential equations class only being taught at MIT during the Spring semester.

Directed by Ryan Coogler, _Black Panther: Wakanda Forever_ centers on the leaders of Wakanda fighting to protect their nation from intervening world powers in [the wake of King T’Challa’s death](https://www.cbr.com/marvel-original-plan-both-tchalla-shuri-black-panther-coexist-mcu/). The film, which introduced Tenoch Huerta Mejía as Namor, the king of Talokan, was released to critical acclaim, with the film so far earning over $842 million at the worldwide box office. A sequel, tentatively titled [_Black Panther 3_, is reportedly in development](https://www.cbr.com/black-panther-3-development-letitia-wright-mcu/), according to star Letitia Wright. The actor, who plays Shuri/Black Panther in the MCU, recently stated that she believes _Black Panther 3_ is "already in the works." However, at this time Marvel Studios has not yet announced _Black Panther 3_, meaning Wright's comments should be taken with a grain of salt for now.

Marvel Studios Is Releasing an Official MCU Timeline Book
---------------------------------------------------------

While Disney+'s MCU timeline order feature has been helpful, it is incomplete, with _The Incredible Hulk_ and Tom Holland's _Spider-Man_ trilogy being absent due to not being available to stream on Disney+. This means that fans have to figure out where these films would slot in alongside the ever-growing collection of films and series. Luckily, a new Marvel Studios encyclopedia is being released later this year that promises to "answer the biggest questions: what happened, when, where, and why." Described as "the definitive, filmmaker-endorsed guide" to the MCU and its timeline, the upcoming encyclopedia, titled _Marvel Studios [The Marvel Cinematic Universe An Official Timeline](https://www.cbr.com/marvel-studios-cover-art-mcu-official-timeline/)_, will "follow the entire story of the MCU from before the Big Bang to the Blip and beyond."

Although _Black Panther: Wakanda Forever_ is now available to stream on Disney+, fans will still be to catch the blockbuster on the big screen during Black History Month. AMC Theaters has revealed plans to offer [discounted tickets for _Wakanda Forever_](https://www.cbr.com/amc-theaters-black-history-ticket-discounts-wakanda-forever/) and other films from Black actors and creators, including _The Woman King_, _Till_ and _Devotion_. More than 200 AMC locations will charge patrons $5 each to watch the _Black Panther_ sequel, which will return to theaters for a one-week engagement from Feb. 24 to Mar. 2.
