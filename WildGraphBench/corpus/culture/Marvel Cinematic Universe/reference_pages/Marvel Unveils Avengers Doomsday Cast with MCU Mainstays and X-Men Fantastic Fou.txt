The cast announced included Chris Hemsworth (Thor), Tom Hiddleston (Loki), Anthony Mackie (Captain America), Sebastian Stan (The Winter Soldier), Paul Rudd (Ant-Man), Letitia Wright (Black Panther), Wyatt Russell (U.S. Agent), Simu Liu (Shang-Chi), Florence Pugh (Yelena Belova), Danny Ramirez (The Falcon) and Winston Duke (M’Baku).

It also included X-Men actors Patrick Stewart (Prof. X), Ian McKellen (Magneto), James Marsden (Cyclops) and Rebecca Romijn (Mystique), who kicked off the modern era of superhero movies with 2000’s _X-Men_, the film Marvel Studios boss Kevin Feige cut his teeth on as an assistant.

They will be joined by _X2: X-Men United_‘s Alan Cuming (Nightcrawler) and Kelsey Grammer (Beast), who starred in _X-Men: The Last Stand_ for 20th Century Fox and had a cameo in _The Marvels_. Channing Tatum, who once was attached to a Gambit movie that never happened, will also appear in _Doomsday_ after making his debut in _Deadpool & Wolverine_.

Members of the Fantastic Four are also in the cast, including Pedro Pascal (Mr. Fantastic), Vanessa Kirby (The Invisible Woman), Ebon Moss-Bachrach (The Thing) and Joseph Quinn (The Human Torch).

_Thunderbolts*_ newcomer Lewis Pullman (Bob) is on the callsheet, along with stars David Harbour (Red Guardian) and Hannah John-Kamen (Ghost).

Tenoch Huerta Mejía, who played the Submariner in _Black Panther: Wakanda Forever_, was the first true surprise of the casting event. There were questions over his return to Marvel after he was accused of sexual misconduct in June 2023, claims he [denied](https://web.archive.org/web/20250326205542/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/tenoch-huerta-denies-sexual-assault-allegations-1235513215/)as “false and completely unsubstantiated.” He [dropped out](https://web.archive.org/web/20250326205542/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/tenoch-huerta-exits-fiesta-en-la-madriguera-sexual-assault-allegation-1235513212/) of a Netflix movie amid the media storm, and later appeared as a guest at Marvel’s _Echo_ premiere event, suggesting he and the studio were on good terms.

The event was simple. It included a shot of a director’s chair with a star’s name on the back. Every twelve minutes or so, music from the next actor’s movie would play, and the camera would shift to a new chair and name. It ended with the swell of a new take on composer Alan Silvestri’s _Avengers_ theme, revealing with Robert Downey Jr. (Doctor Doom) in a suit and tie to “shhh” the camera.

Marvel first announced _Avengers:_ _Doomsday_ to fanfare at San Diego Comic-Con in July, with the surprise reveal that Downey would be returning to the MCU after retiring the role of Iron Man with _Endgame_. The move reunited Downey, Marvel’s most bankable star, with [the Russo Bros](https://web.archive.org/web/20250326205542/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/avengers-doomsday-directors-1236161664/)., Marvel’s most bankable directors, who likewise had departed the MCU after _Endgame_.

Marvel boss[Feige first pitched Downey](https://web.archive.org/web/20250326205542/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/robert-downey-jr-kevin-feige-doctor-doom-1235979584/) on the idea of returning as Doom, while Downey himself convinced the Russo Bros. to return to the fold after spending the last half decade working in the world of streaming movies. The pair opted to return after their frequent screenwriter collaborator Stephen McFeely pitched them his take.

_Doomsday_ has a release date of May 1, 2026, while follow-up _Avengers: Secret Wars_ is on the calendar for May 7, 2027.
