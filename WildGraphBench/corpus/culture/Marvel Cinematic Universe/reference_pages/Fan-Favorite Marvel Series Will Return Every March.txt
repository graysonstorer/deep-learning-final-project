Brad Winderbaum, Marvel Studios Head of Streaming, Television, and Animation, has provided a massive update regarding a beloved **Marvel series**, much to the delight of **MCU** fans. In a recent interview, the long-term Marvel executive revealed that the current plan for the Charlie Cox-led **Daredevil: Born Again** series is to release a new edition every other year.

Daredevil: Born Again to return with new seasons every March
------------------------------------------------------------

While speaking to Agents of Fandom about the recently released Marvel Zombies, Brad Winderbaum revealed that the Daredevil: Born Again team intends to drop a new season of the fan-favorite series every other March, provided that there is still demand for the show from MCU fans.

Highlighting how Marvel Studios has now “embraced a traditional development cycle” and wants to put out “stuff that can sustain for multiple seasons,” Winderbaum noted, “Daredevil: Born Again is an annual release every March, you know, for as long as people enjoy the show.”

The veteran producer then added that other ongoing Marvel series will also follow a similar premiere pattern, stating, “Same thing with X-Men ’97 and Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man. We’ve got this annual cadence starting next year, which I think is really important.”

Daredevil: Born Again made its debut on the small screen in March of 2025, marking Charlie Cox’s return to Hell’s Kitchen as the Man without Fear after a seven-year hiatus. Since then, Marvel Studios has confirmed plans for a follow-up edition, even renewing it for a [third](https://www.superherohype.com/tv/628474-daredevil-born-again-gets-renewal-update-ahead-of-season-2)[season](https://www.superherohype.com/tv/628474-daredevil-born-again-gets-renewal-update-ahead-of-season-2).

While Daredevil: Born Again Season 2 is currently on track to come out in March 2026, it has yet to receive an official release date from its makers. Considering Winderbaum’s latest statements and the recent renewal of the show, Season 3 should see the light of day sometime in March 2027.
