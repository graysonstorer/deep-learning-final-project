Every[Marvel One-Shot](https://www.cbr.com/tag/marvel-one-shot/) is now available on Disney+.

After several of the shorts were added to the Marvel hub on Disney+, the streaming service now has every Marvel One-Shot available to view. Originally released as DVD extras, primarily during Phase One of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the one-shots include _Agent Carter_(2013), _Team Thor_ Parts 1 and 2 (2017), _Team Darryl_ (2018), _Item 47_ (2012), _The Consultant_ (2011) and _A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer_ (2011).

Both the[_Item 47_](https://www.cbr.com/marvel-one-shot-item-47-hid-biggest-mcu-twist/) and _Agent Carter_ one-shots ultimately led to the creation of both _Agents of SHIELD_ and _Agent Carter_, starring Hayley Atwell,as Marvel Television series._The Consultant_ stars Agent Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) and serves as an explainer for a continuity error that occurred in 2008's _The Incredible Hulk_, where Robert Downy Jr.'s Tony Stark is shown as the one who first presented the idea of the Avengers. Gregg also stars in _A Funny Thing..._ where he is shown foiling a gas station robbery while driving to New Mexico to locate Mjolnir.

**CBR VIDEO OF THE DAY**

The _Team Thor_ shorts appeared as extras on the _Doctor Strange_ Blu-ray, which depicted what Chris Hemsworth's God of Thunder was doing in his absence during _Captain America: Civil War_. The follow-up, _Team Darryl_, appeared on the Blu-ray for _Thor: Ragnorok_ and featured Jeff Goldblum.

Among the one-shots is _All Hail the King_, written and directed by _Iron Man 3_(2013) co-writer Drew Pearce,[which was added early last year](https://www.cbr.com/disney-marvel-all-hail-the-king-short-shang-chi-essential-viewing/)as essential viewing ahead of the release of _Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings._ The short sees Trevor Slattery (Sir Ben Kingsley) in prison following the events of the third _Iron Man_ film, but is then taken captive by the Ten Rings organization for impersonating their leader, later revealed to be Wenwu (Tony Leung) in S _hang-Chi_.

While _All Hail the King_ is not a new addition, _Agent Carter_ returns after being [removed from Disney+ entirely](https://www.cbr.com/disney-plus-removed-mcu-agent-carter-one-shot/) in September 2021. The short was also included as an extra for _Iron Man 3_, and would lead to a series of the same name starring Atwell's Peggy Carter. At the time, a reason for its removal from the streaming service was not provided.

Marvel Studios hasn't produced a Marvel One-Shot since _Team Darryl_, though co-president Louis D'Esposito said in 2018 that Disney wants [more one-shots from Marvel](https://www.cbr.com/disney-wants-more-marvel-one-shots/), but timing is a major issue. "We're just so busy," he said at the time. "Disney wants us to do it, _we_ want to do it, and I keep telling them, 'I'll do it on the next film,' but I keep breaking my promise."

For now, all seven Marvel One-Shots are available on Disney+.
