**_\*One tiny minor spoiler mentioned in this press conference recap, but as you know from the trailers—which have already shown Ladypool, other characters, and how the Time Variance works- variants are a thing in “[Deadpool & Wolverine](https://web.archive.org/web/20240722222018/https://www.marvel.com/movies/deadpool-and-wolverine).”_**

OK, no spoilers, but we’ve seen the first 40 minutes of “**Deadpool & Wolverine.”** It’s probably safe to say, given many reactions are already out there on social media, so far, it’s promising, entertaining, funny, gory, violent, and hyper-irreverent—all the things you’re expecting and likely wanting from a “**Deadpool**” movie. Plus, it includes some teases about how the movie will tap into some new emotional avenues because, as you’ve already seen in the trailers, both characters are in a dark place.

Following the preview screening, director **Shawn Levy, Hugh Jackman, Ryan Reynolds,** Marvel President **Kevin Feige**, **Emma Corrin** (“Cassandra Nova”), **Matthew Macfadyen** (Paradox/“Mobius M. Mobius”), and **Wendy Jacobson** (Producer) sat for a press conference hosted by **Rob Delany** (Peter).

**_\*Mild spoiler starts in this sentence, which you could avoid if you want\*_**

Everyone was very tight-lipped and careful, and nearly zero spoilers were touched upon. Still, Hugh Jackman let slip that his favorite Wolverine variants in the film were Patch and Apocalypse. We’ll say nothing further, but you’ll have to google those names if you want to investigate for some visual cues.

**_\*Mild spoiler ends.\*_**

The rest of the press conference was relatively routine: how it was a love fest to work with one another, the cast and producers talking about how “Deadpool & Wolverine” is about friendship, should be seen on the big screen, and is, as Kevin Feige added, “the most wholesome R-rated movie ever.”

But one answer did jump out as mildly interesting when Feige was asked about how important “Deadpool & Wolverine” is to the future of the MCU and the potential before and after element it potentially represents for Marvel as a kind of crossroads. In his answer, the Marvel Chief tackled two topics: the R-rating and Mutants. In the R-rated aspect, Feige suggested, you may not see an R that often (or ever?), but didn’t fully elaborate on when and where we could see it again.

“Every \[Marvel\] film is important, and there’s nothing better than a great movie for a Cinematic Universe,” he began. “The before and after \[aspect of it all\]? I think a lot of people talk about the R-rating and, ‘Is every \[Marvel\] movie going to be R-rated after this?’ \[And the answer is\] of course not. But I hope every movie after this embraces its tonality the way the way ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ and the way this team does.”

Does this mean another Marvel movie strongly suggested to have an R, like “**Blade**,” will shy away from that rating? As of now, it’s unclear. However, Reynolds also chimed in about this first in Marvel history. “The R-rating is never exploited; it’s never really used just to use it,” he explained. “It’s just there as a facility to tell the most authentic story about these two iconic characters coming together on screen for the first time.”

In the second part of his answer Feige addressed the “**X-Men**” finally being allowed into the Marvel Cinematic Universe thanks to “Deadpool & Wolverine” and suggested the Mutant Saga won’t necessarily have to wait until the **Multiverse Saga**—which ends with “**Avengers: Secret Wars**”—is complete to begin.

“Also, the ‘after’ is clearly—now that we have characters from the ‘X-Men’ world, the Mutants—we haven’t had access to before,” he continued. “So, this is the beginning of that, and every \[movie\] post ‘Deadpool & Wolverine’ will be the Mutant era coming into the MCU.”

This makes sense, as “**The Marvels**” post-credit already showed Monica Rambeau (**Teyonah Parris**) trapped in an alternate universe that featured two “X-Men” characters in Beast (**Kelsey Grammer**) and Binary (**Lashana Lynch**). And the **Russo Brothers** ([who may direct “**Avengers: Secret Wars**”](https://web.archive.org/web/20240722222018/https://theplaylist.net/marvel-in-talks-with-the-russo-brothers-to-direct-next-2-avengers-films-20240717/)) have strongly hinted over the years that they would love to have access to Wolverine in a ‘Secret Wars’ movie and could easily have him. And who knows, maybe that alt-X-men” universe that Monica Rambeau is in also has an entire team at the ready that could be utilized, too. Time will tell.

“Deadpool & Wolverine” hits theaters on July 29, via [Disney](https://web.archive.org/web/20240722222018/https://www.disney.com/) and [Marvel Studios](https://web.archive.org/web/20240722222018/https://www.marvel.com/movies), but you can read our review on July 23 at 6pm ET when the embargo breaks. Stay tuned.
