**Warning: Contains SPOILERS for _Eternals_**

Kaz and Ryan Firpo, writers of Marvel Studios' latest film,[**_Eternals_**](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-eternals/), recently gave concrete confirmation of the controversial film's placement in the broader MCU timeline. Directed by Academy Award-winning auteur Chloé Zhao,_Eternals_ released last week and has quickly become one of the most [divisive entries into Marvel's expansive slate](https://screenrant.com/eternals-movie-reviews-divisive-rotten-tomatoes-reason/) of comic book blockbusters. Zhao's film bucks many longstanding traditions present throughout the various films of the MCU – most notably, the film remains insulated in its own corner of the universe, largely isolating itself from events and characters from previous films in the franchise.

**SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY**

Due to the standalone nature of the film's narrative,[_Eternals'_ placement in the overarching MCU chronology](https://screenrant.com/eternals-avengers-endgame-thanos-not-interfere-war-reason/) has been unclear.The film does, however, contain several substantial references to the events of _[Avengers: Infinity War](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers-3/)_ and[_Endgame_](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers-4/) (e.g. Thanos' snap and Iron Man and Captain America's retirements). So, while _Eternals_ has been confirmed to be post-_Endgame_, its placement in relation to other post-_Endgame_ stories (like[_Spider-Man: Far From Home_](https://screenrant.com/tag/spider-man-homecoming-2/),[_The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_](https://screenrant.com/tag/falcon-and-winter-soldier/), and[_Shang-Chi_](https://screenrant.com/tag/shang-chi/)) was unknown.

_Eternals'_ writers recently addressed these questions in an exclusive interview with _Screen Rant_. The Firpos confirm that _Eternals_ takes place _"more or less concurrently with Falcon and Winter Soldier,"_ which would place _Eternals_ roughly half a year after the [events of _Endgame_](https://screenrant.com/loki-show-avengers-endgame-multiple-timelines-confusing-explain/).Check out the full excerpt below:

> I think we're happening more or less concurrently with Falcon and Winter Soldier, so everyone's got their hands full and I think you're gonna start to see the groundwork has been laid for something that's gonna happen in a very big way soon.

The writers go on to hint that the events of the film will have major implications on the future of the MCU.Indeed, _Eternals'_ two post-credit scenes have already teased future storylines with the introduction of Thanos' brother, Starfox (Harry Styles), as well as the MCU's incarnation of the iconic vampire hunter, Blade (Mahershala Ali). With many of Marvel's most popular characters now thoroughly established and explored, the studio seems determined to mine the more obscure corners of Marvel Comics lore for their future storylines.

Despite the mixed reactions toward _Eternals_, the film has unequivocally established itself as a [crucial addition to the MCU](https://screenrant.com/eternals-movie-marvel-mcu-spinoffs-setup-future/). Shows like _[WandaVision](https://screenrant.com/tag/wandavision/)_ and _The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_ are important in their own ways as they explore and develop their respective protagonists in complex ways; however, cosmic stories like the one depicted in**_Eternals_** typically set up the universe-wide stakes for future crossover event films. The scale of stories in the MCU vary greatly, but that's just a testament to the storytelling potential of a vast cinematic universe when it is executed with care.
