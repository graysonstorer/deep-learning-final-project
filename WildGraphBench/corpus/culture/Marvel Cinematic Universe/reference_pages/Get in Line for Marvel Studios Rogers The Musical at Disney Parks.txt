Steve Rogers will really find out if he could “do this all daaaaaay” in [_Rogers: The Musical_,](https://web.archive.org/web/20230621084210/https://gizmodo.com/the-rogers-the-musical-composers-worked-very-hard-to-m-1848298271) the [previously announced special one-act show](https://web.archive.org/web/20230621084210/https://gizmodo.com/avengers-musical-disneyland-rogers-california-adventure-1850150855) coming to [Disney California Adventure](https://web.archive.org/web/20230621084210/https://gizmodo.com/theme-park-news-disneyland-universal-studios-meow-wolf-1850524882). Its limited run will be June 30-August 31.

The Marvel Studios in-universe parody show about Steve Rogers—which apes Lin-Manuel Miranda’s _Hamilton,_ and appeared in _Hawkeye’s_ opening episode on Disney+—has become real. The musical project came to fruition with the efforts of Disney Live Entertainment in partnership with writer Hunter Bell, star and book writer of the Tony Award-nominated _[title of show]_, and will feature five all-new songs with music by Grammy-winning composer Christopher Lennertz, and lyrics by Lennertz, Jordan Peterson, and Alex Karukas. The show will, naturally, feature fan-favorite numbers “Save the City” from _Hawkeye_ (written by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman) and “Star Spangled Man” (written by Alan Menken and David Zippel) from _Captain America: The First Avenger_.

Assemble your friends if you plan to see it when it premieres at the West Coast park, because you’re going to need an Avengers-style plan. And yes, that means technology is involved. You’ll be able to access viewing areas for _Rogers: The Musical_ through the Disneyland app’s virtual queue system, which will distribute reservations for _Rogers: The Musical_ each day beginning at 10:30 am PT for the first two show times of the day, and 2:00 pm PT for the remaining show times of the day. If you’re old-school like Steve and Bucky, you can try for tickets on standby on a first-come, first-served basis, if they’re available after the virtual queue reaches capacity; check at the Hyperion Theater before _Rogers: The Musical_ begins for any walk-ups. For diehards, there will be a special _Rogers: The Musical “_ Premium Viewing Experience” package that comes with perks like a themed popcorn bucket and priority choice of seating in the theater.

_Rogers: The Musical_ is set to be performed multiple times daily, Tuesday through Saturday during the limited engagement—but be sure to check [Disneyland.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20230621084210/https://disneyland.disney.go.com/guest-services/virtual-queue/?CMP=ILC-DPFY23Q3wo0615230011A) before booking your trip to make sure it’s running while you’re there. If you go, be sure to sample the Steve Rogers-approved Disney foodie treats being offered as part of the opening, which will coincide with the Fourth of July weekend, at select locations around Disney California Adventure Park.
