[Freeform](http://variety.com/t/freeform/) is venturing into the [Marvel](http://variety.com/t/marvel/) universe.

The younger-skewing Disney-owned network has greenlit “Marvel’s [Cloak and Dagger](http://variety.com/t/cloak-and-dagger/)” with a straight-to-series order,_Variety_ has exclusively learned.

Described as a superhero love story, “Cloak and Dagger” is based on the titular comic book duo (also known as Tandy Bowen and Tyrone Johnson) who have appeared in Marvel Comics classics, including “Spiderman” and “X-Men” stories.

[![Image 10: SHADOWHUNTERS - “The Mortal Cup” - One young woman realizes how dark the city can really be when she learns the truth about her past in the series premiere of "Shadowhunters" on Tuesday, January 12th at 9:00 - 10:00 PM ET/PT. ABC Family is becoming Freeform in January 2016. Based on the bestselling young adult fantasy book series The Mortal Instruments by Cassandra Clare, "Shadowhunters" follows Clary Fray, who finds out on her birthday that she is not who she thinks she is but rather comes from a long line of Shadowhunters - human-angel hybrids who hunt down demons. Now thrown into the world of demon hunting after her mother is kidnapped, Clary must rely on the mysterious Jace and his fellow Shadowhunters Isabelle and Alec to navigate this new dark world. With her best friend Simon in tow, Clary must now live among faeries, warlocks, vampires and werewolves to find answers that could help her find her mother. Nothing is as it seems, including her close family friend Luke who knows more than he is letting on, as well as the enigmatic warlock Magnus Bane who could hold the key to unlocking Clary's past. (ABC Family/John Medland) KATHERINE MCNAMARA](https://pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/139653_8691.jpg?w=300&h=167&crop=1)](http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/shadowhunters-renewed-season-2-mortal-instruments-freeform-1201729260/)
[‘Shadowhunters’ Renewed for Season 2 at Freeform](http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/shadowhunters-renewed-season-2-mortal-instruments-freeform-1201729260/)

The live-action interracial romance follows the duo, two teenagers from very different backgrounds, who find themselves burdened and awakened to newly acquired superpowers while falling in love — Tandy can emit light daggers and Tyrone has the ability to engulf others in darkness. They quickly learn they are better together than apart, but their feelings for each other make their already complicated world even more challenging.

No writer has been attached to the series, but the search is currently under way. Marvel Television and ABC Signature Studios will co-produce.

[Marvel’s Mockingbird Series Starring Adrianne Palicki Lands ABC Pilot Order (EXCLUSIVE)](http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/marvel-mockingbird-spinoff-series-most-wanted-adrianne-palicki-nick-blood-abc-1201574713/)

The characters’ story is targeted toward young adults, making “Cloak and Dagger” a seamless fit for Freeform (previously ABC Family) whose target audience is “Becomers,” the 14-34 demo.

Marking the network’s first-ever Marvel series, Freeform is following in the footsteps of big sister net ABC, which has a slew of Marvel properties on its slate including “Agents of SHIELD” and “Agent Carter,”plus Mockingbird spinoff [“Marvel’s Most Wanted](http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/marvel-mockingbird-spinoff-series-most-wanted-adrianne-palicki-nick-blood-abc-1201574713/)” and a top-secret Marvel project from John Ridley in development. Getting Freeform into the Marvel game is a smart move for Disney-ABC, as the cable network is held to lower ratings standards than a big broadcast network. (ABC has struggled with ratings for [“Agent Carter,”](http://variety.com/2016/tv/columns/marvels-agent-carter-1201718887/) which remains on the bubble in the wake of [critical praise](https://variety.com/2016/tv/columns/marvels-agent-carter-1201718887/).)

Superhero fare is a new genre for Freeform, which recently pushed into fantasy fare with[“Shadowhunters.”](http://variety.com/2016/tv/news/shadowhunters-renewed-season-2-mortal-instruments-freeform-1201729260/)That drama was just renewed for a second season, and “Cloak and Dagger” will pair nicely with the saga series, broadening the net’s programming.

well this sounds horrible. I’ve wanted to see Netflix give these two the series they deserve. This whole romance garbage just sounds dumb. You don’t need to waste great Marvel characters to do a stupid teen romance story.

nice been wishing they would get some live action marvel loving. for they were one of the very first marvel characters i ever saw. plus this also means their creator may get some money too for his medical needs. now wonder who they will get as cloak and dagger?

Oh god……

 Some teen romance BS. Thats horrible.

 I wanted Amanda Seyfried and Denzel to play them on the big screen, and now Marvel are gonna let ABC “agents of shield” them…..

Such a disappointment.

I don’t know how anyone even REMEMBERED these distinctly obscure characters from the 90’s (late-80’s/early-90’s Marvel was -hurtin’-), except that the former Separated At Birth Channel wants to continue its new demographic as the Teen Drama Queen network.

 There are plenty of other more contemporary teen girls in Marvel from this millennium, but the movie studio is probably saving Ms. Marvel for their Inhumans agenda, and Fox has a claim on X-23.

As if a relationship with that age gap is some impossibility. I don´t want them romantically involved at all.

Umm there are how many white characters on tv right now? WTF? And you can’t even say this was created just to bother people. These two comic book characters have existed for YEARS. You bigots always think people are attacking you. Its almost funny

Comic had SUCH a huge impression me. Been wondering when someone might develop it. AWESOME concept as Cloak is relentless defender of Dagger while their powers complement each other in opposites. One of those cases where darkness associated with Black character doesn’t bug me at all. Fits his moodiness. Comic was SO well-written though. Will require some serious writing and a great writing team to pull it off I think.

You guys aren’t bothered by them being lovers here? In the comics, they were friends. this changes the whole dynamic.

this series is going to end up looking like Supergirl. Two of my favorite Marvel characters being reduced to a teen romance just to get young girl viewers. Lame, dumb, stupid
