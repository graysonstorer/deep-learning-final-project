JK Simmons’ J Jonah Jameson Labels Spider-Man a ‘Miscreant’ on New Daily Bugle Website (Video)
==============================================================================================

“You are a criminal. A miscreant. A masked maurader. A menace. Thanks for watching. Don’t forget to like and subscribe,” Simmons says

[Brian Welk](https://www.thewrap.com/author/brian-welk/ "Posts by Brian Welk") | September 26, 2019 @ 8:02 AM 

J. Jonah Jameson is a real reporter, a truthteller “breaking through the clutter” to bring you the truth about the “miscreant” and “menace” that is Spider-Man.

He’s been fighting this fight for years in the Spider-Man comics, but his character, as made iconic by actor J.K. Simmons in the original “Spider-Man” trilogy of movies, has gotten a leg up on that fight with a new website launched behind his name and brand. You can now check out [TheDailyBugle.net](https://www.thedailybugle.net/), a site featuring articles and conspiracy theories about Spider-Man, as well as a brief teaser video of Simmons himself reprising his role as Jameson.

“Spider-Man: a psychopath wielding powers he has no right to possess, trying to pass himself off as a hero. Let me tell you something kid. You are no hero,” he says in the video. “Mysterio! That’s a hero. You are a criminal. A miscreant. A masked maurader. A menace. Thanks for watching. Don’t forget to like and subscribe!”

The Daily Bugle site is tied to the upcoming Blu-Ray and DVD release of Sony’s “Spider-Man: Far From Home” on Oct. 1. Those who have already seen the film know that Simmons appeared briefly in “Far From Home” during the film’s post-credits sequence. Without spoiling what’s revealed in that moment (you can find out [here](https://www.thewrap.com/does-spider-man-far-from-home-extended-cut-have-post-credits-scene-peter-parker-mysterio-nick-fury-phase-four-mcu/)), the character of J. Jonah Jameson has been updated from that of a ruthless newspaper editor to more of an Alex Jones type.

It was the also the first time a Marvel movie nodded to a film outside the MCU like the original “Spider-Man” trilogy by bringing back an actor from one of those films. Though we’re guessing following the split between Sony and Disney that such callbacks won’t be happening again any time soon.
