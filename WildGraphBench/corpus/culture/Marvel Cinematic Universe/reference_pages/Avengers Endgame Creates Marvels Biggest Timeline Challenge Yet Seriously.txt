**WARNING: [Major spoilers for](https://screenrant.com/avengers-endgame-movie-spoilers/)[_Avengers: Endgame_](https://screenrant.com/avengers-endgame-movie-spoilers/).**

[_**Avengers: Endgame**_](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers-4/) creates a big timeline problem for the Marvel Cinematic Universe going forward and, while it's not a full-blown plot hole, it puts a lot of pressure on the movies coming in Phase 4.

While the interconnected continuity has been one of the MCU's strongest elements, allowing Marvel to tell stories on a scale that would be otherwise unwieldy few would deny it's been a rocky road for those following closely. Because the [gameplan for the MCU](https://screenrant.com/marvel-original-avengers-plan-mcu-phase-1-different/) - first to [_The Avengers_](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers/) and then the team's showdown against Thanos in [_Avengers: Infinity War_](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers-3/) - was always changed as story goalposts moved and characters evolved, the films are riddled with narrative road bumps that don't quite add up: from Tony Stark's is-he-isn't-he membership of the team in Phase 1 to [Odin's "fake" Infinity Gauntlet](https://screenrant.com/thor-ragnarok-infinity-gauntlet-joke-plot-hole-tesseract/) to [_Spider-Man: Homecoming_](https://screenrant.com/tag/spider-man-homecoming/)'s "_eight years later_" snafu, the list of inconsistencies to spot even as bigger picture pieces fall into place is long.

And yet, somehow, _Avengers: Endgame_ manages to confuse things even further. This isn't about the movie's use of [time travel](https://screenrant.com/avengers-endgame-time-travel-explained/) either; as we've discussed at length, while it creates some confusing plot loops and possible branching timelines, the end result is an untampered MCU timeline. Nor does _Endgame_ mistake real-world release dates for in-universe time or similar mistakes that make the [Marvel timeline](https://screenrant.com/mcu-timeline-official/)actually impossible to chart (we'll get to that).

No, what _Avengers: Endgame_ does is entirely self-contained, yet with a major impact on movies coming in the near and far future. It isn't a plot hole yet, but lays the groundwork for some biggies. And, in honor of _Spider-Man: Homecoming_, it's only right it comes from a time jump.

Avengers: Endgame Ends In 2023 (And It's Messy)
-----------------------------------------------

_Avengers: Endgame_ picks up in the immediate wake of [_Avengers: Infinity War_](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers-3/) - per Tony Stark's message from space, 22 days - with the team still reeling from Thanos' victory.They discover the Mad Titan,learn he's destroyed the Infinity Stones, Thor beheads him, and then the film jumps forward five years.

No official dates are given directly, but it can be verified as now being in 2023 by multiple means: [_Infinity War_ took place in 2018](https://screenrant.com/avengers-infinity-war-marvel-timeline-fix/) (per Tony it was six years after _The Avengers_ in 2012); Thanos is told in 2014 that Nebula is from nine years in the future.And even with all the time travel in the middle act of _Avengers: Endgame_, everything ultimately returns to 2023 for the final victory against Thanos; Hulk is even forbidden from affecting anything in the preceding five years when bringing back the Vanished. No way around it,[_Avengers: Endgame_ ends](https://screenrant.com/avengers-endgame-ending-explained-marvel-movie-future/) in 2023.

This isn't just the future of the world we know, however. This is a world that has been utterly decimated by Thanos' actions, where half of all life disappeared for a period of five years before returning as if nothing happened; per Peter Parker, from the perspective of snap victims, no time passed at all; they went dusty, passed out, then woke up in 2023. To everyone else, though, everything happened. People mourned and tried to move on, and in a more general sense people changed; you have two populations split by their experiences, one five years older than the other. This is a post-dystopia, a world in recovery.

Yet we don't get a sense of that at all. Defeating Thanos is an immediate victory, one that has everybody return to their normal lives; the happy ending montage betrays no sign of anything out of the ordinary. The implication, at least as how _Avengers: Endgame_ tells it, is that with Tony's snap, everything bad Thanos wrought has been undone.But as nothing can be changed, that just can't be the case.It's reminiscent of when [_X-Men: Apocalypse_](https://screenrant.com/tag/x-men-apocalypse/) saw Magneto destabilize the Earth's core and cause mass destruction around the world yet he got away with a slap on the wrists, except Marvel has endeavored to explore the genuine ramifications of these events.

The Big Timeline Challenge Of Avengers: Endgame's Ending
--------------------------------------------------------

It used to be that unless otherwise stated, MCU movies took place in the year they were released (obvious exceptions were the period-set [_Captain America: The First Avenger_](https://screenrant.com/tag/captain-america/) and direct sequel [_Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_](https://screenrant.com/tag/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2/)). That went out of the window in Phase 3, which saw[_Captain America: Civil War_](https://screenrant.com/tag/captain-america-3/)'s 2016 story followed up by _Homecoming_ and _Black Panther_, despite the movies releasing in 2017 and 2018 respectively. It was, normally, this approach that created Marvel's timeline plot holes.

Having _Avengers: Endgame_ finish in the future may appear to be a way to work around this, to have everything exist in the not-too-distant future similar to the Fox [_X-Men_](https://screenrant.com/tag/x-men/) films and provide license to be a bit more free and loose. But in a constantly evolving world,there's just too much baggage; and this goes a lot bigger than the wrong year number.Will every movie to come adjust the characters' relationships to reflect whether they survived the snap or not, accounting for different aging and life experience? While there's nothing directly contradicting at this point, continued ignorance of the ramifications will leave a timeline that challenges the illusion of permanent impact more than ever before.

And that's not even mentioning practicalities of the five-year time jump. The MCU shifting to 2023 means all films must take place then or later; the next eight entries (assuming three a year except for 2020) are all in the relative future (or have to be set before 2018, at least a year in the past). That's a strange restriction, and considering the aforementioned road bumps created following _[Civil War](https://screenrant.com/captain-america-civil-war-marvel-comics-mcu-early/)_,unlikely to be smooth.

What Is Going On With Spider-Man: Far From Home?
------------------------------------------------

The immediate question for this is [_Spider-Man: Far From Home_](https://screenrant.com/tag/spider-man-homecoming-2/), the next Marvel Studios movie that releases a little over two months after _Avengers: Endgame_. The fact that a Spider-Man sequel must release in 2019 (a result of the deal struck between Marvel and Sony to bring the character to the MCU back in 2015) has provided problems already for _Endgame_: Sony had to start marketing a movie featuring a character who, when audiences last saw him, was turned to dust. There were even theories that [_Far From Home_ was a prequel](https://screenrant.com/avengers-infinity-war-spiderman-far-home-europe-trip/), with the film erroneously suggested to be ending just as _Infinity War_ began (the field trip at the start was to MoMA, not Europe).

Now Peter Parker is back to life, having reunited with Ned Leeds at Midtown High, everything is on the surface clear: he can just head to Venice/Prague/London the next summer. Except that doesn't account for the fact this is 2023 and Spider-Man's been out of the loop for five years while many of his classmates won't have been.For [_Spider-Man: Far From Home_ to work as a sequel to _Avengers: Endgame_](https://screenrant.com/spider-man-far-home-before-after-avengers-endgame/)as has long been stated, all of MJ, Ned, Flash Thompson, Betty Brandt and Remy Hii's character need to have been snapped and returned, which is incredible odds for a 50/50 snap.

The obvious solution to this is that [_Far From Home_ is actually a prequel](https://screenrant.com/spider-man-far-home-prequel-endgame/)after all, set before everything that happened in _Avengers: Infinity War_ (albeit not immediately). There would be minor continuity questions to be had there - why doesn't Spider-Man use his black-and-red suit in _Infinity War_? - but they're easy enough to explain, especially considering there's an almost two-year gap after _Spider-Man: Homecoming_ before Thanos arrives. However, even if that's the plan, it merely prolongs the inevitable addressing of the MCU future timeline.

Marvel Is Trying To Ignore Avengers: Endgame's Timeline Problem
---------------------------------------------------------------

After _Spider-Man: Far From Home_, the next Marvel movies are unavoidably prequels. In 2020, [_Black Widow_](https://screenrant.com/tag/black-widow/) will show Natasha Romanoff's time as a spy in the 1990s/2000s (and, considering her [_Endgame_ death](https://screenrant.com/black-widow-avengers-endgame-death-marvel-movie-future/), is unlikely to have any modern-day framing device) and [_The Eternals_](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-eternals/) is a founding prequel to the whole MCU. That means it won't be until 2021 and the expected releases of _Black Panther 2_, _Shang-Chi_ or _Doctor Strange 2_ that we'll really see a post-_Endgame_ world. On the [Disney+ Marvel TV](https://screenrant.com/marvel-tv-shows-disney-streaming-service/) side, _Loki_ and _WandaVision_ shows involve characters dead or removed from the timeline, essentially meaning their connection to the Infinity aftermath is loose at best.

What this indicates is that, for up to two years following _Avengers: Endgame_, Marvel won't actually need to explore the ramifications of the movie's ending. And considering that in two years Thor went from searching for the Infinity Stones to yukking it up on Sakaar, it's clear that memory is short; this putting it off could create the illusion that, despite 2021 being two years before when _Endgame_ is supposed to have ended, everything can have reverted back to normal. There's no guarantee this is actually what Marvel is going for, but their slate does mean it'll be something debated for a long time.

We Should Just Accept MCU Timeline Issues
-----------------------------------------

As already stated in the introduction, this isn't the first time a new Marvel movie has created timeline issues ([_Captain Marvel_ had several plot holes](https://screenrant.com/captain-marvel-movie-mcu-retcons-plot-holes/)), and while _Avengers: Endgame_'s problem is more directly applicable to the future than usual, it really highlights the problem with overthinking these movies. At a glance, the ending of _Avengers: Endgame_ makes sense - [Tony Stark dies](https://screenrant.com/avengers-endgame-who-dies-characters-stay-dead/) to beat Thanos, Steve Rogers returned the Infinity Stones to their right place in the timeline, everybody moved back to their lives - and that is how the movie wants to be taken.

This is why the oft-discussed timeline hiccups across the MCU are never that detrimental to the enjoyment of the movies at hand. In fact, even as [Phase 3's release order](https://screenrant.com/marvel-mcu-phase-3-schedule-fixed-changed/) became erratic, so too did the focus go from just bluntly setting up the future to telling singularly unique stories that interested audiences enough to _want_ to watch everything converge; [_Thor: Ragnarok_](https://screenrant.com/tag/thor-3/)leaning into the funny did much more to build excitement for _Infinity War_ than the God of Thunder being obsessed with the Infinity Stones as initially pitched.As niggling as all they can be,these plot holes only ever affect mapping the MCU timeline rigidly; when watching the movies as a story, not a historical document, the gaps are negligible.

And so while that approach to storytelling means that expecting the ending of _**Avengers: Endgame**_ to have the very real effects it should is foolhardy, it does mean something else: [MCU Phase 4](https://screenrant.com/mcu-phase-4-movies-in-development/) should have some really good, hopefully standalone, movies!
