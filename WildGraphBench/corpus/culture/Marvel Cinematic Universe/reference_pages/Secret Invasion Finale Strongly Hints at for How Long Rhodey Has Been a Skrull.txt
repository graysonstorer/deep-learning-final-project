**_The following contains spoilers from the_[Secret Invasion](https://tvline.com/t/secret-invasion/)_finale_.**

“Colonel Rhodes…? How long have you been here?”

The answer, as revealed in the _Secret Invasion_ finale, is “a long time.”

But more specifically, it was suggested that Colonel Rhodes was swapped out with a shapeshifting Skrull soon after he was gravely injured during the epic airport battle scene in 2016’s _Captain America: Civil War_.

During that Avengers vs. Avengers skirmish, Rhodes as War Machine was accidentally hit by Vision, whose blast incapacitated his supersuit, causing him to fall. When neither Tony Stark/IronMan nor Sam Wilson/Falcon were able to catch him, Rhodes crashed into the ground _hard_, fracturing his spinal column and leaving him paralyzed from the waist down.

Though Rhodes lost the use of his legs, Stark would outfit his friend with with next-gen braces to help him learn to walk again. ([Read our full recap](https://tvline.com/recaps/secret-invasion-recap-season-finale-episode-6-1235018708/).)

**But _somewhere_ between the events of those two paragraphs you just read, Rhodey became a Skrull**, as strongly hinted in the _Secret Invasion_ finale now streaming on Disney+.

![Image 9](https://tvline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/secret-invasion-rhodey-skrull-civil-war.png?w=650)

Midway through the _Secret Invasion_ finale, G’iah and Gravik, both freshly imbued with Super Skrull powers, slugged it out. After G’iah emerged victorious by felling Gravik, she dashed into the New Skrullos facility to free the people who had been strapped into fracking pods for the purpose of being “duplicated” by rebel Skrulls.

That is where Everett Ross (whose Skrull imposter was revealed in the series premiere), once “awakened,” turned to Rhodey on his right and asked, “Colonel Rhodes…? How long have you been here?”

Rhodey — still wearing the hospital gown from, presumably, when he sustained his _Civil War_ injury — tried to step out of his pod but teetered.

“Whoa! Colonel Rhodes, I’ve got you,” said G’iah, rushing to catch him. “You’ve been held hostage, for a _long_ time.”

As in, for at least, what, seven years and a Blip…?

Meaning, in both _Avengers: Infinity War_ and _Endgame_? Rhodey a Skrull!

When Tony died? Rhodey a Skrull!

Marvel Studios chief Kevin Feige had hinted that [_Secret Invasion_ viewers would eventually “understand exactly how long [Rhodey has](https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/secret-invasion-don-cheadle-kevin-feige-rhodey-skrull)[]](https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/secret-invasion-don-cheadle-kevin-feige-rhodey-skrull)[been a Skrull](https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/secret-invasion-don-cheadle-kevin-feige-rhodey-skrull),” adding: “We like the idea of fans going back and watching some of the other appearances of Rhodey and realizing that that wasn’t him.”

And yes, I get this is an entertainment site and yes, they have a job to report news on current TV shows and are not responsible for the care their readers take. But honestly, did it had to be be the headline? Just scrolling through the articles is enough to ruin it for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet.

Given the news desert caused the strikes, and the high profile nature of the MCU, there are going to be serious articles with huge spoilers in the title.

 .

 I’m not going to tell you not come here. I’m going to tell you to watch stuff as soon as its available if you want to read this site. Or accept what you read in article titles on the main page.

And by all means write the article and discuss the show. But did have to be in the headline was my question? If you’re coming here immediately to read an analysis then you are already aware of the character’s status and don’t need the f headline to convince you to read the article. So then who is it meant to “grab”? I’m just saying there is a happy medium. And they have put [SPOILER] in headlines before.

This site is supposedly for everyone, not just the hyper online so you can achieve your same goals without ruining the enjoyment of people who dare to not watch tv 24/7. Just saying something like, “major spoiler alert, who is a skrull”, would actually give someone a reason to click and read the article. Then they would serve the hyper online and not alienate everyone else. This is a great site, but being lazy and alienating your readers is not the way.

To say that someone should watch ALL content as soon as it is available in order to browse an entertainment site is a weird position to take. 😂

That’s plenty of buffer for spoilers.

Realistically, spoiling the headline makes me click in annoyance and gets me to comment so I guess job well done on their part. But as someone who’s been coming to this site since day 1 it definitely irks me. I love tv but my schedule doesn’t allow me to watch as quickly as I used too. I guess I should stop caring about tv news as a whole as to not be spoiled? That’s a bummer.

It reminds me of the old days when TVGuide.com did more news and recaps. They would always redact the name ([SPOILER] Died Last Night!) but then show the character in the thumbnail next to it. 😂

I haven’t been able to start that series yet. Using the verbage you had in your comment would have been helpful.

The Skrulls have had Rhodey for 9 years? That doesn’t make any sense.
