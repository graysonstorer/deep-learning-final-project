‘Ant-Man and the Wasp’ Takes Place During ‘Avengers: Infinity War’
==================================================================

The “Ant-Man” sequel is definitely going to have some big story implications for “Avengers 4”

[Phil Hornshaw](https://www.thewrap.com/author/phil/ "Posts by Phil Hornshaw") and [Phil Owen](https://www.thewrap.com/author/phil-owen/ "Posts by Phil Owen") | April 30, 2018 @ 12:20 PM  Last Updated: April 30, 2018 @ 12:34 PM 

![Image 6: Ant-Man](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Ant-Man.jpg)
Marvel

_(Note: This post contains very mild spoilers for “Avengers: Infinity War.” No ending talk here. For our spoiler-filled discussion of the ways that “Ant-Man and the Wasp” could impact the story of “Infinity War” and next year’s “Avengers 4,” [click here](https://www.thewrap.com/will-ant-man-wasp-factor-insane-avengers-infinity-war-cliffhanger/).)_

“Avengers: Infinity War” has arrived, along with Thanos, a threat so big almost every hero in the Marvel Cinematic Universe had to band together to fight him. As Marvel Studios has promised, the Thanos conflict is having huge impacts on the MCU.

We won’t see exactly how those impacts will play out until “Avengers 4,” however, even though there are two more MCU movies being released before “Avengers 4” hits theaters in May 2019.One is “Captain Marvel,” which takes place in the 1990s and is releasing in March 2019. ([For an in-depth look at how “Captain Marvel” might impact “Avengers 4,” click here.](https://www.thewrap.com/will-captain-marvel-play-wild-avengers-infinity-war-ending/)) The other is “Ant-Man and the Wasp,” the sequel to the 2015’s “Ant-Man.”

**Also Read:**[How Will 'Captain Marvel' Play Into That Wild 'Avengers: Infinity War' Ending?](https://www.thewrap.com/will-captain-marvel-play-wild-avengers-infinity-war-ending/)

“Ant-Man and the Wasp” is coming out later this summer, in July, but don’t expect to see the aftermath of Thanos’ romp through the MCU explored in the movie. That’s because the second “Ant-Man” movie starts _before_“Avengers: Infinity War”and then gets into what Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) were up to while everyone else was fighting Thanos _during_ the mega-blockbuster.

The official synopsis says that “Ant-Man and the Wasp” begins “in the aftermath of ‘Captain America: Civil War,’ ” and a [new teaser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l7TOYJZBtI) suggests the movie will tell why the characters weren’t part of the big throw-down. So, yeah, “Ant-Man and the Wasp” is not going to be some kind of irrelevant side story.

We have lots of thoughts about the pile of potential ways the events of “Ant-Man and the Wasp” could influence the story of Thanos and “Avengers 4.” [You can read our deep dive into all “Ant-Man and the Wasp” possibilities right here](https://www.thewrap.com/will-ant-man-wasp-factor-insane-avengers-infinity-war-cliffhanger/). That post is full of spoilers about the ending of “Infinity War.”

**Also Read:**[How Will 'Ant-Man and the Wasp' Factor Into That Insane 'Avengers: Infinity War' Cliffhanger?](https://www.thewrap.com/will-ant-man-wasp-factor-insane-avengers-infinity-war-cliffhanger/)

So here’s what the fact that it’s a prequel means for how the plot sets up: Ant-Man fought on the technically illegal side of Captain America (Chris Evans) in “Civil War.” Cap and his allies were operating without sanction under the Sokovia Accords, the legal document in that movie that dictated laws specifically about what the Avengers could do and who they answered to. Most of Cap’s allies were arrested in “Civil War,” including Scott.

In “Infinity War,” Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) explains the reason Ant-Man and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) aren’t there to fight Thanos: They’re both under house arrest, having taken plea deals to protect their families after “Civil War.” “Ant-Man and the Wasp” catches up with Scott while he’s dealing with those legal repercussions — in the trailer we see him getting fitted with an ankle monitoring bracelet. As set up in the first “Ant-Man” movie, though, “Ant-Man and the Wasp” will deal with venturing back to the Quantum Realm, the small universe made up of the space between molecules and atoms, to try to find and rescue the original Wasp, Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer).

Marvel is playing this whole thing so close to the vest that it’s likely we won’t know how all that matters in the big picture until we actually sit down and watch “Ant-Man and the Wasp” in a couple months. So stay tuned!

All 50 Marvel Movies Ranked, Including 'Avengers: Infinity War'
---------------------------------------------------------------

*   ![Image 7: all 50 marvel movies ranked thor ragnarok, black panther avengers infinity war](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/all-50-marvel-movies-ranked-thor-ragnarok-black-panther-avengers-infinity-war.jpg)With over 30 years of theatrically released Marvel movies, it's always a good a time to rank 'em all, from"Howard the Duck" to the Marvel team-up to end all Marvel team-ups, "Avengers: Infinity War" 
*   ![Image 8: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**50. "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer"**

Just a nightmare. A total nightmare. There have been a number of bad superhero movies, but from the talking gas cloud the filmmakers cast as Galactus to [Jessica Alba](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/jessica_alba/)'s dye job, this one transcends bad. 
*   ![Image 9: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**49. "X-Men Origins: Wolverine"**

A totally chaotic stir fry of nonsense that tells the story of how Wolverine got his claws. Features an early version of Deadpool (also played by [Ryan Reynolds](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/ryan_reynolds/)) whose mouth is stapled shut, which should tell you all you need to know about it. 
*    
*   ![Image 10: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**48. "Elektra"**

That five minutes when they tried to turn [Jennifer Garner](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/jennifer_garner/) into an action star went about as well as it should have. 
*   ![Image 11: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**47. "X-Men: The Last Stand"**

Just a total mess, incoherent from the word "go." After losing director of the first two X-Men films Brian Singer to the first Superman reboot attempt, replacement [Matthew Vaughn](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/matthew_vaughn/) gave way to eventual director [Brett Ratner](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/brett_ratner/), who might have killed off the superhero genre entirely were "Spider-Man" not blowing up the box office. 
*   ![Image 12: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**46. "Fantastic Four" (2015)**

There could maybe have been a good movie in here somewhere-- the cast ([Michael B Jordan](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/michael-b-jordan/), [Miles Teller](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/miles_teller/), [Kate Mara](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/kate_mara/)) certainly warranted one. But this Frankenstein of a film is a behind-the-scenes horror story, and you can see it in the totally disjointed final product. 
*    
*   ![Image 13: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**45. "Daredevil"**

This was basically "Early-2000s: The Movie," with [Ben Affleck](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/ben_affleck/), [Jennifer Garner](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/jennifer_garner/), [Colin Farrell](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/colin_farrell/) and Michael Clark Duncan as the main players. The cherry on top of this turd sundae was that damn Evanescence song. 
*   ![Image 14: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**44. "Fantastic Four" (2005)**

[Tim Story](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/tim_story/)'s first "Fantastic Four" is just sort of there, challenging you to remember it exists. With [Chris Evans](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/chris_evans/), who played the Human Torch here, going on to embody Captain America in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that gets tougher every year. 
*   ![Image 15: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**43. "Iron Man 2"**

Swaps [Terrence Howard](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/terrence_howard/) for [Don Cheadle](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/don_cheadle/), while[Mickey Rourke](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/mickey_rourke/)breaks cars with laser whips. Who knows what was going on in this movie, but it was almost OK anyway. 
*    
*   ![Image 16: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**42. "The Punisher" (2004)**

This is the Punisher as a straight revenge thriller, and it's not bad. [Thomas Jane](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/thomas_jane/) performs admirably, but the whole thing is missing that extra something that would have elevated it beyond standard genre fare. Setting it in Tampa didn't help. 
*   ![Image 17: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**41. "Spider-Man 3"**

Maybe the bad outweighs the good here, but Emo Peter Parker's dance number remains one of the greatest single moments in any comic book movie, sorry, haters. 
*   ![Image 18: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**40. "Howard the Duck"**

A notorious flop at the box office and, yeah, it's not exactly "good." But now, 30 years removed from its premiere, "Howard the Duck" is pretty fun as a relic of the '80s. 
*    
*   ![Image 19: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**39. "The Punisher" (1989)**

[Dolph Lundgren](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/dolph_lundgren/) and Louis Gossett Jr. star in a low-rent '80s grunge C-level classic. This one's all novelty value. 
*   ![Image 20: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**38. "Ghost Rider"**

For a movie starring Nic Cage about a dude who rides a Harley and turns into a flaming skeleton, this is a surprisingly mundane movie. 
*   ![Image 21: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**37. "The Amazing Spider-Man"**

We may never figure out what went wrong with [Marc Webb](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/marc_webb/)'s Spider-Man duology, but his choice of [Andrew Garfield](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/andrew_garfield/) to play Peter Parker is still brilliant. It just sucks that this movie doesn't really make any sense. 
*    
*   ![Image 22: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**36. "X-Men"**

The beginning of the current wave of theatrical superhero movies, "X-Men" was kind of a cheapie and it showed. Novel at the time, now it just comes off as unremarkable mid-budget action fare as Fox was merely sticking its toe in the superhero waters. Timid. 
*   ![Image 23: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**35. "The Incredible Hulk"**

It's sometimes hard to remember that this one counts as part of the MCU, since it placed Ed Norton in the Dr. Banner role since inhabited by [Mark Ruffalo](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/mark_ruffalo/) in the "Avengers" films. It's also hard to remember because it's generally not memorable. 
*   ![Image 24: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**34. "Thor"**

The fantasy Marvel movie is directed by [Kenneth Branagh](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/kenneth_branagh/), who covers the whole movie in canted angle shots and theatrical stylings. It's pretty boring, also, but at least it looks cool. 
*    
*   ![Image 25: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**33. "The Amazing Spider-Man 2"**

More of the same impossible-to-follow hack-n'-[slash](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/slash/) plotting from the previous movie, offset by [Andrew Garfield](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/andrew_garfield/) continuing to be awesome and [Jamie Foxx](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/jamie_foxx/) going way over the top as the big bad. 
*   ![Image 26: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**32. "Thor: The Dark World"**

"The Dark World," in contrast to the first "Thor" movie, is certainly not boring. If anything, it suffers the opposite problem, going so hard and fast that it loses substance. 
*   ![Image 27: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**31. "Blade: Trinity"**

Starring a pre-Deadpool [Ryan Reynolds](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/ryan_reynolds/) basically playing a vampire-slaying Deadpool, throwing out one-liners like his mama's life depended on it, this may not a "good" movie, but it sure is fun. 
*    
*   ![Image 28: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**30. "X2: X-Men United"**

A big step up from the first "X-Men" both in production values and quality, it still lacks much in the way of energy. Which is inexcusable when you've got[Alan Cumming](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/alan_cumming/) as the teleporting mutant Nightcrawler all over your movie. 
*   ![Image 29: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**29. "Spider-Man"**

[Sam Raimi](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/sam_raimi/)truly assembled the prototypical superhero movie with this first entry in the"Spider-Man" franchise, in 2002. Like "X-Men" before it, "Spider-Man" is a bit underwhelming today, but unlike "X-Men" it was proud of its nerd roots. 
*   ![Image 30: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**28. "X-Men: Apocalypse"**

Could have been a bizarre ironic summer classic if it were structured like a real movie and had any character development whatsoever. Instead it's just a shot of visual adrenaline that I'll probably want to revisit at some point -- but not when I'm sober 
*    
*   ![Image 31: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**27. "Avengers: Age of Ultron"**

"Ultron" is frustrating for what it lacks -- chiefly the feeling that it's advancing the overall story arc of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. But as with the first "Avengers" movie its weaknesses are overcome by great character work. 
*   ![Image 32: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**26. "Iron Man"**

It was [Robert Downey Jr.](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/robert-downey-jr/)'s reemergence on the big screen, and he's flawless in this origin story that takes Tony Stark from billionaire playboy weapons manufacturer to billionaire playboy other-things manufacturer. 
*   ![Image 33: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**25. "Blade"**

Pure B-movie trash, which is fine because that's precisely what it aims for: bloody, crass, awesome. Blade, by the way, remains the only black comic book character besides [Shaquille O'Neal](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/shaquille_oneal/)'s "Steel" to get his/her own movie, though Marvel's "Black Panther" is slated for a 2018 release. 
*    
*   ![Image 34: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**24. "Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance"**

For the sequel, they tapped the "Crank" director duo known as Neveldine/Taylor. It was an inspired choice, because "Spirit of Vengeance" was exactly as nutty as you'd hope a PG-13 comic book movie would be. Shame that it was apparently stressful enough to break up the tandem of [Mark Neveldine](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/mark_neveldine/)and[Brian Taylor](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/brian_taylor/). 
*   ![Image 35: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**23. "Captain America: The First Avenger"**

A lot of folks like to complain that all superhero movies are the same. But this was actually a pretty good World War II movie, too. 
*   ![Image 36: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**22. "Punisher: War Zone"**

Whereas the previous "Punisher" movie was melodramatic and contemplative, this one is just murderous. And it's _awesome._ 
*    
*   ![Image 37: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**21. "Guardians of the Galaxy"**

Plot-wise, it never really adds up to anything, but the strength of the cast and the bizarre world they explore more than make up for it. 
*   ![Image 38: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**20. "Blade 2"**

Beloved nerd [Guillermo del Toro](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/guillermo_del_toro/) took over for this one and ramped everything up to 11. More vampires, more blood, more people getting sliced up -- and of course baddies whose jaws can split open and swallow a person's head whole. 
*   ![Image 39: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**19. "Big Hero 6"**

Disney Animation Studios made a Marvel movie, and it's really sweet. Sure, it's the kiddie version of Marvel, but that doesn't prevent it from being a wholly satisfying experience. 
*    
*   ![Image 40: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**18. "Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2"**

An improvement on the first film, and an absolute delight from moment to moment -- but it never quite coalesces into a coherent whole because so many subplots distract from the core story and rob it of its emotional impact. Would be a top 5 comic book movie if it had just reigned in the plot. 
*   ![Image 41: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**17. "Hulk"**

In 2003 the modern wave of superhero movies was still in its infancy, and [Ang Lee](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/ang_lee/)--still the best filmmaker to do a comic book movie--got experimental with "Hulk." And what he made was an incredible melodrama with visual stylings meant to ape comic book panels. It didn't sit well with audiences, but "Hulk" remains one of the most compelling and interesting Marvel movies to date. 
*   ![Image 42: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**16. "The Wolverine"**

This was, like,just a legitimately enjoyable melodramatic action movie. Sure, it turns into a video game boss battle by the end, but for most of its running time it's just an actual movie. 
*    
*   ![Image 43: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**15. "The Avengers"**

The story is a total mess, relying heavily on moviegoers'memories of previous MCU films(if you didn't remember or know coming in what the Tesseract was, hoo boy). But the novelty of the Marvel's first big superhero team-up was irresistible, and director [Joss Whedon](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/joss_whedon/) balanced his ensemble expertly, giving everyone plenty to do so none of them ever fades into the background. 
*   ![Image 44: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**14. "X-Men: Days of Future Past"**

Its time travel logic is a bit iffy, but "Days of Future Past" is still tremendously entertaining because, while epic, it's not overly serious. As "Back to the Future" taught us long ago, you can get away with a lot of logical leaps if you strike the right tone. 
*   ![Image 45: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**13. "Deadpool"**

In the angsty and angry times we live in, "Deadpool" is perfect. Aggressively violent and flippantly meanspirited, it's the exact emotional release we needed. 
*    
*   ![Image 46: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**12. "Ant-Man"**

"Ant-Man" represented a first for the MCU by being a straight-up comedy. And it's a very good one, with a cast that's perfectly suited for it. Aside from [Paul Rudd](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/paul_rudd/)who plays Ant-Man himself, [Michael Pena](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/michael_pena/) is the true standout as Scott Lang's best friend and former cellmate. 
*   ![Image 47: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**11. "X-Men: First Class"**

The first "X-Men" movie that could be described as "fun." It's basically two movies crammed into one, story-wise, but director [Matthew Vaughn](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/matthew_vaughn/)'s touch is so breezy and enjoyable that it totally works anyway, thanks in large part to a brilliant cast that includes [Michael Fassbender](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/michael_fassbender/), [Jennifer Lawrence](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/jennifer_lawrence/) and [James McAvoy](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/james_mcavoy/). 
*   ![Image 48: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**10. "Spider-Man: Homecoming"**

Not quite the best "Spider-Man" movie, but still an absolute delight, with a cast full of scene stealers. Michael Keaton as the Vulture makes for one of the best Marvel villains ever.

If it weren't hamstrung with all the requisite elements of an origin story, "Doctor Strange" might have been the best Marvel movie ever. That's the power of the astonishing visual imagination on display here. People love to talk about the nebulous concept of capturing some long lost childlike sense of wonder though the magic of cinema -- "Doctor Strange" is one of the only movies I've watched as an adult that really accomplishes that. 
*   ![Image 50: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**8. "Spider-Man 2"**

This is a movie that fully understands its main character and taps into what made him such a captivating figure for so long. Yeah, Peter Parker's a superhero, but he's also a college kid working a minimum wage job to make rent while also taking university physics classes. Peter buckles under the pressure, something we can all relate to. 
*   ![Image 51: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**7. "Iron Man 3"**

As far as I'm concerned this is _the_ "Iron Man" movie. Somehow, [Shane Black](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/shane_black/) was able to infiltrate the MCU and make a legitimate [Shane Black](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/shane_black/) movie with all the wit and raw humanity you'd expect from him. It carries exactly the sort of authorial identity we should want all these movies to have. 
*    
*   ![Image 52: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**6. "Thor: Ragnarok"**

A thorough delight. This might be the most fun we had at the movies in all of 2017, and so we can't help but love it. 
*   ![Image 53: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**5. "Captain America: Civil War"**

Multiply the two previous best Marvel movies by one another and you get "Civil War." It packs the sort of emotional payoff all the disconnected Marvel movies can't really provide. And as an action film it's _easily_ the best of the superhero genre. 
*   ![Image 54: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**4. "Black Panther"**

It's held back a little by being saddled with standard "origin movie" issues -- introducing audiences to the world of Wakanda isn't a quick and easy task, and it could use an extra 15-20 minutes to flesh out the supporting characters -- but still manages to be the most substantial superhero movie ever. It's kind of amazing that Disney let writer/director Ryan Coogler make this overt a political statement -- it's the most openly political mega-budget movie I've ever seen . Also, while I'm listing superlatives: Michael B Jordan delivers the best performance ever in a superhero movie. Good lord. 
*    
*   ![Image 55: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**3. "Avengers: Infinity War"**

You could certainly make the argument that "Infinity War" does not really hold up on as a complete movie on its own, because it kinda begins with the second act. But I don't care. The culmination of this ten-year shared universe experiment _should_ stand on the shoulders of the movies that came before it. The fact that it packs such a profound emotional punch, however, is what really makes it work. 
*   ![Image 56: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**2. "Captain America: The Winter Soldier"**

The Russo brothers, who made their entrance to the MCU directing "Winter Soldier"before taking the reigns on "Civil War" and, eventually, 2018's"Avengers: Infinity War," really impressed with "Winter Soldier." It's a classic spy thriller with a superhero twist. And [Robert Redford](https://www.thewrap.com/tag/robert_redford/) as the bad guy is a really nice touch. 
*   ![Image 57: fantastic four rise of the silver surfer](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif)**1. "Logan"**

James Mangold's small-scale western is a game changer for the entire superhero genre, daring to defy pretty much standard by which you expect these movies to operate. It's just a great movie by any normal standard. Where "Civil War" elevated the genre, "Logan" opts instead to be something else entirely and we're all the better for it.

Can Johnny Depp Bounce Back From ‘Modern-Day Scarlet Letter’ of UK Court’s ‘Wife Beater’ Ruling?
================================================================================================

“He’s basically given them the rope to hang him(self) with,” crisis PR expert Evan Nierman says of Depp’s failed lawsuit against tabloid The Sun

Johnny Depp has shattered his reputation — putting what one crisis PR expert called a “modern-day scarlet letter” on his personal brand — after a British judge on Monday shot down his libel suit against the Sun and ruled that the tabloid’s claim that the star was a “wife beater” was “substantially true.”

“This is a terrible day for self-deluded prima donnas in Hollywood who are out of touch with reality and believe that they could will their own vision of reality to judgment,” Eric Schiffer, leading international expert in reputation, brand and political strategy and chairman of Patriarch Organization and ReputationManagementConsultants.com, told TheWrap. Describing Monday’s ruling as a “body blow” to the actor that will be a “precursor of further carnage to Depp,” he added, “This is a modern-day scarlet letter across Johnny’s brand and he’s going to need to deal with this through making amends.”

Evan Nierman, founder of crisis management firm [Red Banyan](https://redbanyan.com/our-team/evan-nierman/), agreed: “Rehabilitating his image is going to be much harder than it would’ve been before going into court.”

Experts agree that the PR damage from the ruling is likely to hurt Depp’s reputation in Hollywood — at least in the near term — at a time when his box office power has steadily waned.

Depp is currently shooting a supporting role in the third installment of J.K. Rowling’s “Fantastic Beasts” series, and has completed work on the MGM drama “Minamata.” He is also a spokesmodel for Dior’s Sauvage fragrance. Warner Bros. has plans for additional “Fantastic Beasts” installments but it’s unknown if Depp’s character, Grindelwald, will continue beyond the upcoming film.

But he has no known acting projects lined up after that. Reps for the actor, Dior and Warner Bros. did not respond to requests for comment.

The actor’s star power had already been tarnished by his short-lived marriage to Amber Heard, whose accusations of physical abuse became tabloid fodder after their divorce in 2017. But experts called his decision to pursue legal action against both Heard and news outlets — including a [still-ongoing $50 million libel lawsuit](https://www.thewrap.com/johnny-depp-ordered-deposed-amber-heard-50-million-defamation-case/) against the Washington Post — a tactical and PR mistake.

“From the beginning, Depp, for whatever reason, felt like he needed to take this dramatic step of going to the British high court,” Nierman said. “He presumed being labeled a ‘wife beater’ was beyond the pale and for whatever reason, he decided to put his foot down. The risk that he was running was making things potentially worse for himself. Now the entire world knows the details about this relationship he had — he put himself squarely in the spotlight and amplified it more than it would’ve been if he just had left it alone … Now that he’s lost, he has cemented in everyone’s mind the very allegations he was hoping to be exonerated of.”

Justice Andrew Nicol affirmed the Sun’s [description of the star as a “wife beater”](https://www.thewrap.com/johnny-depp-loses-uk-libel-suit-wife-beater-claim-called-substantially-true/)and ordered the actor to pay all court costs in the case: “I have found that the great majority of alleged assaults of Ms. Heard by Mr. Depp have been proved to the civil standard.”

Nicol’s decision “ratified the reality of the charges leveled against him, but the massive damage to his persona had largely had been done,” Schiffer said. “This just adds credibility to what people had assumed had happened under the dumpster fire of allegations. Being named a ‘wife-beater’ in entertainment torches the possibility of him working in multimillion-dollar projects.”

In fact, Nierman said that calling attention to Heard’s accusations — and then losing his court case — may have made it even harder to secure future roles, especially in family-friendly franchises like “Pirates of the Caribbean” that made him a superstar.

“There is going to be an outcry,” he said. “He’s basically given them the rope to hang him with.”

What’s worse, Depp’s days as a major box office draw have long been in decline. Since his debut in “A Nightmare on Elm Street” in 1984, films starring Depp have grossed over $10 billion at the global box office. This includes three billion-dollar hits: “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest” in 2006, “Alice in Wonderland” in 2010, and “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides” in 2011.

![Image 70: pirates of the caribbean 5](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/pirates-1.jpg)
“Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” (Disney)

But since the release of “On Stranger Tides,” Depp’s box office numbers have receded. Only two films since then have grossed over $400 million worldwide: “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” in 2017 and “Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald” in 2018 — where he had only a glorified cameo.

While Depp may struggle to land big roles in the near term, few expect him to be exiled forever.

“When it comes to movies and celebrities, we have a short memory, and we also want to root for our favorite actors. If you are talented, they are going to just look the other way, sadly,” Mark Macias, founder of PR firm Macias PR, said. “I don’t think it’s going to hurt him that much.”

Nierman agreed: “Celebrities often times get a pass, especially ones who have a reputation for being wild-mannered rock and rollers… He’s such a great actor and iconic character that he gets a pass from the American public.”

Depp has the advantage of longevity in the Hollywood spotlight. “When you have a long-lasting iconic brand, it takes a lot to bring down a big ship. He’s a big ship, with a lot of franchises behind him, that’s a brand that’s instilled in us,” Macias said. “That’s why Hollywood probably won’t give up on him.”

Going forward, the experts advise Depp to keep a low profile and consider a treatment program for alcohol or substance abuse — in the London case, Heard testified that Depp turned into a violent version of himself after consuming drugs and alcohol that she said [he called the “Monster.”](https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-relationships-johnny-depp-newspapers-amber-heard-d2384d9f576e4aac940fe3ffaea38db1)

“Because he’s such a beloved actor, he has a chance to unbury himself,” Schiffer said. “It’s up to Depp to be transparent and make peace and show how he’s working to enlighten his behavior with greater controls to regrow trust and that’s all demonstrating regret about his past behaviors through careful admissions.”

Depp is in a precarious position given the nature of the charges, especially in the #MeToo era — and his continued legal fights to clear his name. “He needs to accept partial blame on this, and project more empathy,” Macias said. “The worst thing he can do is go in hiding or issue a statement, because a statement is only one-sided. Also, don’t attack Amber and instead talk about the positives, ‘Here’s what I learned from this.’ Don’t use the ‘I’ll go to therapy’ because that’s lost its value now.”

Nierman acknowledged the challenges. “He’s got to strike the right balance of not being dismissive, he said.

Finally, the experts agreed that any public rehabilitation will require Depp to keep out of further legal trouble. “He needs to make sure he will never be accused like this again — that includes fighting in the bar or anything that reinforces the anger that can’t be controlled,” Macias said. “Where he is now, it’s bad. He’s in a tough situation.”
