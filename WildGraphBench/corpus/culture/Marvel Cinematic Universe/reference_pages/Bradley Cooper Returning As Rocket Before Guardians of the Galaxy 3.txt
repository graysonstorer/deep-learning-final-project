Bradley Cooper Returning As Rocket Before Guardians of the Galaxy 3
===================================================================

By[Maxance Vincent](https://screenrant.com/author/maxance-vincent/)

Published Jul 22, 2022

Bradley Cooper has been confirmed to return as Rocket Raccoon in at least one of the five shorts for Disney+'s latest MCU show, I Am Groot.

![Image 11: Rocket Raccoon with Groot on his shoulder.](https://screenrant.com/rocket-racoon-bradley-cooper-return-i-am-groot-show/)

Bradley Cooper will be reprising his role as Rocket Raccoon before _[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3](https://screenrant.com/tag/guardians-of-the-galaxy-3/)_ releases in theatres on May 5, 2023. Cooper last voiced Rocket for _Thor: Love and Thunder_ and was already confirmed for _The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special,_ which will release on Disney+ during the 2022 Holiday season. However, the first _Guardians of the Galaxy_-related spinoff series,**_[I Am Groot](https://screenrant.com/tag/i-am-groot/)_**, is hitting Disney+ on August 10, and it looks like this is where audiences will see Rocket next.

Details on Marvel Studios' first series of shorts, centering on Baby Groot, were mostly kept under wraps. [Besides Vin Diesel confirming](https://screenrant.com/guardians-galaxy-3-thor-4-groot-vin-diesel/)on social media that he will be reprising his role as the lovable baby tree and that the series would comprise of five shorts, not much else is currently known. Marvel may be saving the details on _I Am Groot_ for their Marvel Animation panel at San Diego Comic-Con. However, the studio recently premiered one of the shorts, titled "Magnum Opus", in front of select _Thor: Love and Thunder_ screenings at the El Capitan Theatre. As a result, details about _I Am Groot_ that were not previously known have been confirmed.

One of those details is Cooper's involvement in the series. According to _[The Direct](https://thedirect.com/article/bradley-cooper-rocket-raccoon-disney-return?itm\_source=parsely-api)_, the Academy Award-nominated actor's name appears during the end credits of the short. Cooper is now the second _Guardians of the Galaxy_ cast member to reprise his role for the series, alongside Diesel. This will mark the actor's sixth overall appearance in the MCU, after appearing in the first two _Guardians_ films, _Avengers: Infinity War_ and _Endgame_, and, most recently, in _Love and Thunder_.

In the previous films, [Rocket and Groot](https://screenrant.com/groot-guardians-spinoff-mcu-mistake-avoid/) have already been established as close friends, so it isn't a surprise that the fan-favorite raccoon would be appearing, in some way or another, in the show. But it is surprising that Cooper has reprised his role for the Disney+ animated series, as several Guardians-related actors did not reprise their respective roles for _What If...?_ Drax and Peter Quill appeared in the show, but they were not voiced by Dave Bautista and Chris Pratt. Rocket also appeared, but his appearance was a brief, voiceless cameo.

If Rocket appears in the first short of the series, then it's clear that [other _Guardians of the Galaxy_ members](https://screenrant.com/thor-love-thunder-avengers-stronger-than-guardians-galaxy/) could also briefly appear throughout the five shorts. It is still unclear if Rocket will appear in other shorts than"Magnum Opus". However,Bradley Cooper's addition to the show certainly makes sense if Rocket will have a recurring presence throughout the shorts and it'll be interesting to see if anyone else reprises their roles during the other four shorts. Regardless of which Guardians appear and who voices them,**_I Am Groot_** is poised to have plenty of surprises as the series explores five Baby Groot adventures as he travels the Galaxy with Rocket and the rest of the Guardians.
