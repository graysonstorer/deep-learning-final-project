Actor Idris Elba teases Heimdall's possible return to the Marvel Cinematic Universe after his appearance in Thor: Love and Thunder.

Idris Elba, who played Heimdall in the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://www.cbr.com/tag/thor-love-and-thunder/) and [_Thor: Love and Thunder_](https://www.cbr.com/tag/thor-love-and-thunder/), teased the potential return of his character in the future.

In an interview with [SYFY WIRE](https://www.syfy.com/syfy-wire/idris-elba-heimdall-thor-beast-lion-movie), Elba teased his character's return, saying, "Heimdall is a beloved character, I love playing him. There may be something cooking." He then indicated that he's not actually quite sure when, or if, his character is actually returning, though he wouldn't be able to say either way.

Who Was the MCU's Heimdall?
---------------------------

Introduced in 2011's _Thor_, Heimdall serves as the gatekeeper of Asgard and is responsible for the Bifrost. Elba reprised his role in 2013's _Thor: The Dark World_, 2015's _Avengers: Age of Ultron_ and 2017's _Thor: Ragnarok_ before being killed off in 2018's _Avengers: Infinity War_. Heimdall returned [briefly at the end of _Thor: Love and Thunder_](https://www.cbr.com/thor-love-thunder-heimdall-son-mcu/), where he welcomed Jane Foster/Mighty Thor into Valhalla. That movie also featured [Heimdall's son Axl](https://www.cbr.com/thor-4-axl-asgard-king-mcu/) in a prominent role.

Earlier this month, [Elba discussed the different aspects](https://www.cbr.com/idris-elba-thoughts-heimdall-mcu-story-marvel/) of Heimdall that the MCU has yet to explore. The actor specifically brought up how it would be interesting to explore the "immortality around him." In that interview, Elba noted, "the Marvel world is ever-expanding. You just never known [sic]."

It's not clear at this time just if, or how, Heimdall could return to the MCU. It's possible that he might be resurrected in some form in the future. There have also been several movies set in the shared universe's past, such as 2021's _Black Widow_, so it's entirely possible he might appear in a project of that sort.

Thor: Love and Thunder by the Numbers
-------------------------------------

The latest installment in the God of Thunder's solo franchise, _Thor: Love and Thunder_ has earned more than $723 million at the worldwide box office against a budget of around $250 million. This makes it the second-highest grossing film in the franchise behind _Thor: Ragnarok_ at $850 million. Still, reviews for _Thor: Love and Thunder_ have been mixed. Currently, the movie holds a 65 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, the lowest for any film in the series.

_Thor: Love and Thunder_ is in theaters now. It's not clear at this time when the film will arrive on Disney+ or home media. Additionally, it's not clear when the God of Thunder's solo franchise will continue.
