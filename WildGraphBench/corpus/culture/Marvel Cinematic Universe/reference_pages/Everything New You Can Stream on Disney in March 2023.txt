Disney+ is marching into a new month with an exciting new slate!

March kicks off with the premiere of **_Star Wars: The Mandalorian_** Season 3. Once a lone bounty hunter, Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) has reunited with Grogu. Meanwhile, the New Republic struggles to lead the galaxy away from its dark history. The Mandalorian will cross paths with old allies and make new enemies as he continues his journey with Grogu. Speaking of a series from a galaxy far, far away, stream a new episode of **_Star Wars: The Bad Batch_** every Wednesday leading up to the Season 2 finale on March 29.

On Wednesday, March 8, stream the new series **_MPower_**, which salutes the Marvel women who have brought iconic heroes to life, both on- and off-screen. Two days later, stream the new movie **_Chang Can Dunk_**, which follows Chang, a 16-year-old, Asian American high school student in the marching band who bets the school basketball star that he can dunk by Homecoming. The bet leads the 5-foot-8 Chang on a quest to find the hops he needs to dunk in order to impress his crush, Kristy, and finally gain the attention and respect of his peers. Before he can rise up and truly throw one down, he’ll need to rethink everything he knows about himself, his friendships, and his family.

Livestream the **_NHL Big City Greens Classic_** on Tuesday, March 14, at 7 p.m. ET/4 p.m. PT on Disney+ and ESPN+; the first-ever live, animated NHL game telecast between the Washington Capitals vs. New York Rangers will also be broadcast on Disney XD and Disney Channel. The alternate presentation of the game will feature real-time volumetric animation of players and teams modeled after _Big City Greens_ characters.

On Wednesday, March 15, stream **_Turning the Tables with Robin Roberts_** Season 2 in its entirety. Disney Legend Robin Roberts hosts intimate conversations with multiple generations of Hollywood’s most inspiring women. Listen to never-before-heard stories of how each woman learned grace, found fulfillment, conquered certainty, and embraced community. Guests in Season 2 include Yaya DaCosta, Chloe Kim, Hayley Kiyoko, Loni Love, Marsai Martin, Chrissy Metz, Kelly Osbourne, Kyla Pratt, Sheryl Lee Ralph, Brooke Shields, Dionne Warwick, and Rita Wilson. Two days later, **_Bono & The Edge: A Sort of Homecoming, with Dave Letterman_** will premiere. U2’s Bono and the Edge return to Dublin with Dave Letterman, reflecting on their journey as musicians and friends. The Disney+ Original special features never-before-seen footage and interviews detailing their songwriting process and the inspiration behind their music.

Closing out the month on Friday, March 31, is the return of **_Doogie Kamealoha, M.D_**. When Walter (Alex Aiono) returns from the World Surf Tour, he’s not the same boyfriend Lahela (Peyton Elizabeth Lee) said goodbye to months before—nor is she the same girl. That becomes clear when she meets a bad boy on a dirt bike, Nico (Milo Manheim.) She’s faced with a decision: fight for what she knows is true or give new love a chance. It’s all complicated by the pressures of being a teenage doctor. Luckily, she has her family, co-workers, and best friend (Emma Meisel) to support her along the way.

Throughout the month, Disney+ will add new episodes of hit shows such as **_Eureka!_** and **_Marvel’s Spidey and his Amazing Friends_**, as well as complete seasons of classic and new series such as **_Doogie Howser, M.D._** and **_Restaurants at the End of the World_**.

All the titles coming to Disney+ in March are listed below:
