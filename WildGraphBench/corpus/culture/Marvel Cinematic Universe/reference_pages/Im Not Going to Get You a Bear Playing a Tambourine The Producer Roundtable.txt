# 'I'm Not Going to Get You a Bear Playing a Tambourine': The Producer Roundtable

Ridiculous requests, inclusion riders and that "patronizing" popular Oscar: Producers behind 'Black Panther,' 'A Star Is Born,' 'Crazy Rich Asians' and more reveal the new challenges of guiding great films, from streamer-vs.-studio dilemmas to social media spoilers.

"You have to be a bit mad," concedes _The Favourite_ producer Ceci Dempsey of a key commonality among those in her nutty profession. After all, many would consider it madness to pursue one elusive project for two decades — which is how long Dempsey, 65, spent trying to get Yorgos Lanthimos' quirky Queen Anne period film made. For Bill Gerber, it took about half that (11 years) to bring Warner Bros.' remake of the showbiz classic _A Star Is Born_ to the screen, with a previous version (Clint Eastwood was once attached to direct, Beyonce to star) slipping through his fingers before the Bradley Cooper-Lady Gaga musical finally took form.

And while it was only two years ago that Gabriela Rodriguez, 38, signed on to produce Alfonso Cuaron's ambitious autobiographical drama, _Roma_, it was a project that the Oscar-winning director had been wanting to make his whole life. Joined by _Black Panther_ producer (and Marvel Studios chief) Kevin Feige, 45, _22 July_ producer-director Paul Greengrass, 63, and Nina Jacobson, 52 — who guided both _Ben Is Back_ and _Crazy Rich Asians_ to the screen this year — these pros spoke to _THR_ in early October (their conversation has been condensed and edited here) about how they shepherd a helmer's dreams, what's next for representation in Hollywood, [that popular Oscar snafu](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/academy-postponing-new-popular-oscar-category-1140423) and the unique acrobatics of their work behind the scenes.

"I used to watch _The Ed Sullivan Show_, and there was a guy who had 12 plates spinning — it feels like that all the time," says Gerber, 61. "It's like until you get all 12 plates spinning, you're not getting a movie made."

**What's the biggest disagreement you have ever had with a director, and how, as a producer, did you fix that problem?**

**PAUL GREENGRASS** I have that all the time.

**BILL GERBER** With yourself. (_Laughter_.)

**GREENGRASS** Yeah, exactly. So I fire the writer, that's me, and then I always want to fire the director, that's me.

**As a director, what makes a great producer?**

**GREENGRASS** The relationship between a director and a producer is absolutely fundamental, speaking from a director's point of view. The most important thing is that you need to be working with a producer who, in some indefinable sense, you want to please that person. And you always know whether you have that chemistry or not. It comes very, very quickly, and you never lose it, actually — no matter what your arguments are.

**NINA JACOBSON** When you have an honest back-and-forth and you feel like you actually go into the conversation with both receptivity and conviction, that's the most pleasing part of the job. When it's least pleasing is when you have a filmmaker who doesn't actually want your honest opinion — they are so sensitive that in order to get to the thing you want to say, it has to be couched in a whole bunch of preamble.

**KEVIN FEIGE** I've been very lucky to not be in this position very often, when it seems like, "Wait, are we making different movies?" It's almost never happened to us. It's usually a very specific thing you're talking about, and it comes down to, "Why am I getting that note? Am I getting that note because you want to wrap early? Is this a budgetary note?" And I start to get upset, but if you talk it through and [they] realize, "No, this is about the movie," you get through.

**CECI DEMPSEY** I also think if there's a philosophy of making a virtue out of a problem and if you're in sync with your director, that's the best part of your relationship. There may be stomping around and a bit of a tantrum, but ultimately you think, "We're going to make a virtue out of this." There have been so many instances on the last two films I've made [she also produced Lanthimos' _The Lobster_] where ridiculous things happen out of the blue.

**What's an example from _The Favourite_?**

**DEMPSEY** There was a cockfight that figured quite heavily in the beginning of the film, but you can't do a cockfight, and I had to say no. It's not legal, you can't even fake it. And he's into very authentic ... everything has to be authentic. So this was a massive tragedy from which I thought we would never come back. He and [screenwriter] Tony [McNamara] rewrote it as a duck race, which is now one of our favorite scenes. It's funny and it's witty and it's silly, whereas a cockfight would've been very aggressive and quite serious.

**Gabriela, _Roma_ is a true story but a very personal one based on Alfonso's life. How did that shape your responsibilities?**

**GABRIELA RODRIGUEZ** He wanted this creative freedom in this process that there was no studio involvement or anyone flying in to say, "You're spending too much." At the beginning, the fact that we didn't have a script and we did this whole process that was based on his memories and him just telling us what he wanted felt like that was going be the most difficult thing of all.

**Was there a time when you had to put your foot down and say, "We can't do that"?**

**RODRIGUEZ** I tried to tell him "No, we can't do this" a lot, but he always gets his way somehow. (_Laughter_.) We had a meeting with all the neighbors, the ones who used to live there when he was young, and they were like, "Remember there was this bear that used to play a tambourine that used to stand on the corner." And Alfonso goes, "I want a bear playing a tambourine." I'm like, "I'm not going to get you a bear playing a tambourine." And Nico Celis, my co-producer, who is Mexican, he's like, "Oh, I love this challenge, I'm going to do it." After calling every zoo, every place around that could possibly, Nico goes, "Well, maybe I'll wear a bear suit and stand on the corner." I'm like, "This is getting out of hand. Someone tell him he's not getting a bear."

**The industry has changed so much in the past few years. What is required to be a successful producer today that wasn't a requirement a few years ago?**

**GERBER** You have to be aware of a lot more now in terms of this social media aspect. You had no idea how great that was, when you could keep things secret. Now, nothing is a secret. Everything is now under a microscope.

**JACOBSON** Navigating a slate — knowing that to get a movie made and released, every movie needs to have its own intricately plotted path. To get it developed, who cares? It doesn't really matter if you've developed something, it only matters if you've gotten it made. And so with each movie, having to decide and anticipate very early on in the process — what is the path that will actually result in this movie being released, being valued by the people who are releasing it and being seen by hopefully as many people as possible? — is a huge challenge. Because it's not like studios are lining up to make a giant slate of films — many of those films are already decided upon, there are franchises taking up a good chunk of the schedule, so what are going to be the slots?

**GERBER** Don't look at Kevin when you say that.

**JACOBSON** It might have something to do with somebody at this table. I'm not mentioning any names. (_Laughter_.)

**GERBER** Yeah, 2023 July Fourth.

**JACOBSON** So threading the needle so that you still end up mattering is a real challenge.

**Two big studio movies this year, _Black Panther_ and _Crazy Rich Asians_, featured really diverse casts. Was there a big fight you had to take on to get these two movies made?**

**FEIGE** We had _Black Panther_ on our schedule for a while. (_Laughter_.) We had amazing support, [Disney's] Bob Iger and Alan Horn at no point questioned it. Quite the opposite: They said, "This needs to stand alongside the biggest movies you've made." It had a budget that matched that. At no point was there a question about this market or that market or where does it play. It was a big movie that we were going to make with an almost entirely African and African-American cast.

**Nina, what was your strategy to get _Crazy Rich Asians_ to the screen?**

**JACOBSON** We made a very specific decision in that case, which was we're not going to develop it inside the studio system because it will be too easy for somebody to not make it or to have to make a concession that was fundamentally not true to the movie. We went to studios and streaming services with what was a yes-or-no proposition: "Here is our $30 million with an all-Asian cast." And we could then say: "Who is the best, who wants this the most, believes in it the most, is the best home and can find the biggest audience for it?"

**When we're talking about diversity in Hollywood, a big topic of conversation has been the idea of an inclusion rider. What do you think of putting a representation requirement in writing?**

**FEIGE** Well, one question really is: Should people be forced to do it? And maybe the answer is yes, maybe the answer is no. If you're in a position of power and you're the one doing the hiring, we have learned — on our last number of movies and a number of movies that haven't come out or haven't been announced — that the more diverse the group of people around the table, the better the movie. [_Black Panther_ director] Ryan Coogler actually said, "Do you have production designers, costume designers that you like to work with?" And we said, "Sure, but if you have some let us know." And he said, "Well, I've worked with various people on films that were excellent but much smaller than _Black Panther_." And in the case of every single crewmember that he brought to us, they blew us away, they were incredible. And it was because we were open to listening and giving people an opportunity. And now, you know, we're desperate to work with them all on all of our films going forward.

**GERBER** But there is a bottleneck problem, there is a studio issue, there's not enough opportunities for people coming from different backgrounds to get into the business.

**JACOBSON** I do think sometimes people need a push and they need pressure because it is very easy for people to say, "I just want to work with the people I know and trust." (_To Feige_) Not everybody will take the initiative that you guys took in saying, "Yeah, we have an incredible organization that can help support people who are taking a big step up in budget, we have confidence that if you have the talent, we'll have the scaffolding to help you scale it up." If Hollywood and the system need a kick in the pants and a bit of coercion to move the needle, then so be it. Because it's time. And the bottlenecking issue, well, what better reason to try to undertake opening doors, educating people at a much earlier stage about jobs that exist, creating apprenticeships and mentorships so that it's not just that you have to know somebody in order to get a chance to be a grip or to work in the makeup department. Pressure does have to be applied. And if it's applied in the form of an inclusion rider, I'm down.

**In this #MeToo era, how do you ensure that there are no issues of bullying or harassment on set?**

**GERBER** Our crew, it wasn't 50/50, but there were many, many women as heads of departments on _A Star Is Born_. And that was really Bradley Cooper's lifestyle. He is very close with a lot of professional women — my producing partner, Lynette Taylor, on the movie, whom he did _Place Beyond the Pines_ with, [production designer] Karen Murphy and [costume designer] Erin Benach and our first AD, Shelley Ziegler. So if anybody even thought about doing something inappropriate, they probably would think twice. But I think producers and directors who care about these things need to make it very clear from the onset, even just when you're in the office, prepping: There is no tolerance for that. And when the filmmaker is very vigilant about those things and takes it very, very seriously, it just permeates the production.

**JACOBSON** We did [FX series] _Pose_ this past year, and we knew that on the one hand we populated the production at every level with as many trans people of color as we could and as many people who had been from the scene, the [1980s underground drag] ballroom scene, and knew it well and could help educate everybody about the realities of that time as well as this time. But we also knew that we're going to have people on our crew who probably haven't worked with any trans people before, and so you educate and you make sure that you're not afraid to talk about anything in the beginning so that people feel more confident and more secure about how to be with people who are different than them. There is a component of education and creating a safe space and making sure everything gets talked about early so that people aren't just guessing and not sure what's expected.

**RODRIGUEZ** Alfonso hadn't shot in Mexico since _Y Tu Mama Tambien_[2001], and he wanted to be — I don't want to say anti-establishment, but a little bit. He didn't want to necessarily trust that whoever is the biggest Mexican gaffer or the biggest Mexican AD is the right person for this job. He wanted to say, "Who are the young people, who is new? Send me what you've been doing, give me some options because I don't care how old you are, I don't care how many movies you've done before." I mean, it was very unorthodox, so honestly whatever experience you had (_laughs_), maybe you had to unlearn it and adapt to this new process. I don't know exactly the ratio of women or men. There were loads of Mexicans (_laughter_), so maybe that helps the quota in the U.S., minorities all the way. And there were loads of young people. I think Alfonso was the oldest person on set.

"While the director is there worrying about everything, the producer is making sure the entire experience captures the young person's imagination as we were captured," says Greengrass (with Jacobson). "The producer is the person who sees it all."
