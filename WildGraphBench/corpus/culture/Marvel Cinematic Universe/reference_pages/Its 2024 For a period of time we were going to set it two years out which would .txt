Hey, [~~@~~**RhysThom2**](https://web.archive.org/web/20211125093437/https://twitter.com/RhysThom2) - I just want to inquire when Hawkeye is set. I see it getting around the show is two years after Endgame, making it December 2025. Is that true and why the large jump in time again? If you can answer, thanks!

It’s 2024. For a period of time, we were going to set it two years out - which would make it 2025 - hence me messing with your minds about the timeline. But it’s 1 year out.

Thanks for answering this (and for AHM for asking!). This was what I thought, December 2024, as it lines up with Kate's age as well, with her being 22. She looks about 10 in the 2012 flashback so assuming she was not blipped, that lines up well.

And to be fair Endgame was likely around May 2023, so the gap is like 19 months, which is closer to 2 years than 1 :)
