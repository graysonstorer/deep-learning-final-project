James Gunn has officially finished the script for the _[Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special](https://comicbook.com/category/guardians-of-the-galaxy-holiday-special/)_ which is set to debut on Disney+. The director of the _Guardians_ movies (and the upcoming _The Suicide Squad_ for DC) has had a relentless work schedule and one which will only continue to be filled with exciting content creation. Later this year, Gunn gets started of _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3_, where he will also [shoot new footage for the G _uardians of the Galaxy: Cosmic Rewind_ roller coaster](https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/guardians-of-the-galaxy-disney-ride-james-gunn-filming/) heading to Disney World's EPCOT park and this new _Holiday Special_.

"This is the wrapping," Gunn said on social media, captioning a post with a photo of the cover for the finished _Holiday Special_ script. "The present in inside." Of course, we can't feast our eyes on all that lovely dialogue just yet but soon enough the Guardians will be coming to Disney+ for this special event. The script is credited as being written by James "Long Elf" Gunn. There's no telling how he got that nickname but maybe we will learn when the Special arrives in late 2022.

"I wrote the treatment years ago and jut finally finished the script," Gunn said in another tweet. Check out the cover page in the tweet below!

Gunn also confirmed the timing of the _Holiday Special_ which will be canon to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is taking place after the events of _Thor: Love and Thunder_ but before the events of _[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3](https://comicbook.com/category/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3/)_. This makes sense, seeing as _Thor 4_ releases in mid-2022 and _Guardians Vol. 3_ is not expected until 2023. "In full disclosure, I loved the _Star Wars_ _Holiday Special_ as a kid," Gunn also noted to a fan.
