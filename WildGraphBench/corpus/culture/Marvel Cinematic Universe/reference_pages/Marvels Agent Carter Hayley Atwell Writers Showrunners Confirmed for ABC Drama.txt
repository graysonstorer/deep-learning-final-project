The drama, inspired by a _Captain America_ one-shot on the _Iron Man 3_ DVD, has tapped _Reaper_ creators **Tara Butters** and **Michele Fazekas**as showrunners, ABC Entertainment Group president **Paul Lee** announced Friday.

_Agent Carter_ takes place a year after the events of _Captain America: The First Avenger_ and follows Steve Rogers' (**Chris Evans**) girlfriend Agent Carter (portrayed by **Hayley Atwell**) as she builds her career as a secret agent while the hero is frozen in ice.

**[STORY: Marvel Readying 'Agent Carter' Series](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/marvel-readying-agent-carter-series-631871)**

Lee said Friday at the Television Critics Association's winter press tour that the _Agent Carter_ script -- written by _Captain America_ duo **Christopher Markus**and **Stephen McFeely** --has come in, calling it "good."

"That certainly has a good chance to be on the network," Lee said from the stage.

Following the session, Lee also confirmed that Atwell -- long rumored to be attached to the project -- would indeed be a part of the potential series. As for now, though, the ABC Studios/Marvel Entertainment project is merely in development and has not yet been ordered to pilot.

"She's such a strong, wonderful character if you've seen the one-shot," said Butters, at TCA to support ABC's _Resurrection_. "We're happy to be involved." The EP also noted that she and Fazekas could ultimately work on _Resurrection_ and _Agent Carter_ should both dramas continue on for the 2014-15 season.

Fun fact: Butters is married to Arrow EP/comics scribe **Marc Guggenheim**, creating what she called a Marvel and DC Comics household. "We're all inclusive," she joked.

Meanwhile, Lee also praised ABC's Netflix deal, noting the streaming service would be a home for Marvel projects for the "super fan."

The potential _Agent Carter_ series comes as ABC has found modest success with Marvel's _Agents of SHIELD_, a first-year drama that Lee admitted took time to find its "sea legs."
