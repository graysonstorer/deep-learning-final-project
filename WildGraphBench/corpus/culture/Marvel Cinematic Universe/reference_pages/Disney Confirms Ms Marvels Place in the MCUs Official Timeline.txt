Disney+ officially confirms when Marvel Studios' Ms. Marvel series falls on the Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline shortly after its premiere.

![Image 4: Ms-Marvel-1](https://www.cbr.com/ms-marvel-timeline-mcu-disney-plus/)

Disney+ has confirmed where its newest sereis, [_Ms. Marvel_](https://www.cbr.com/tag/ms-marvel-tv/), falls in the Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline.

Disney+ has added a new section among its Marvel Studios properties called, "Marvel Cinematic Universe in Timeline Order." _Ms. Marvel_ appears on this listing after _Hawkeye_ and _Moon Knight_, meaning the new Disney+ series takes place after both of those shows in the MCU.

![Image 5: disney-plus-mcu-timeline-ms-marvel](https://www.cbr.com/ms-marvel-timeline-mcu-disney-plus/)

This confirmation comes after an interview with [_Ms. Marvel_ co-creator and series producer Sana Amanat](https://www.cbr.com/ms-marvel-where-disney-series-fits-mcu-timeline/), who provided an approximation of when the Disney+ series might take place in the MCU. "So, I think right now, we haven't put an official number on how many years have gone by since [_Avengers: Endgame_]," Amanat said. "I cannot tell you off the top of my head because I would butcher it. I feel like it's one to two years [after _Endgame_], something like that, but I don't actually remember [specifically]. But we do have that in our timeline."

While _Avengers: Endgame_ was released in 2019, the film itself took place in 2023 in the MCU. Based on Amanat's estimate, this means _Ms. Marvel_ would take place in either 2024 or 2025. [The setting for _Moon Knight_](http://www.cbr.com/moon-knight-writer-not-sure-mcu-timeline-marvel/), however, is slightly less clear, as head writer Jeremy Slater has said he has "no idea" when the series takes place in relation to _Endgame_. "We didn’t know when our show would debut in relation to their other shows and films, so the timeline was intentionally left vague," he said.

While the exact timing of _Moon Knight_ is unclear, Disney+'s lineup did confirm the Oscar Isaac-led series takes place sometime after _Hawkeye_ and before _Ms. Marvel_. However, director Rhys Thomas confirmed that _Hawkeye_ is set in the year 2024, [around the same time as _Ms. Marvel_](https://www.cbr.com/hawkeye-mcu-timeline-clarification/). "For a period of time, we were going to set it two years out - which would make it 2025 - hence me messing with your minds about the timeline," Thomas said. "But it's [one] year out [from _Endgame_]."

Co-created by editors Amanat and Stephen Wacker, writer G. Willow Wilson and artists Adrian Alphona and Jamie McKelvie, Ms. Marvel/Kamala Khan made her Marvel Comics debut in 2012. Starring Iman Vellani, the Disney+ series will, like the comics, follow the Pakistani-American teen as the titular hero, who was Marvel's first Muslim character to star in her own series and will be the MCU's first onscreen Muslim hero.

According to Amanat, [_Ms. Marvel_ will be every bit as quirky and colorful](https://www.cbr.com/ms-marvel-co-creator-promises-quirky-show-disney-plus/) as the original comics, intermixing animation and live-action as a way to give life to [the fantasies of its protagonist, Kamala](http://www.cbr.com/ms-marvel-mixes-animation-live-action-scenes-mcu/). "It was important to us that you come right into Kamala's world and see it through her eyes," said co-director Adil El Arbi. "It really shows that her head is in the clouds and she's always fantasizing."

New episodes of _Ms. Marvel_ air on Disney+ every Wednesday.
