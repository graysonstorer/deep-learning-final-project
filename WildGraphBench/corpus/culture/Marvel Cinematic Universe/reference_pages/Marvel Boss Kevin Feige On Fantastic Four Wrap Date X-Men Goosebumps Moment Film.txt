### [How Blake Lively Influenced The 'Deadpool & Wolverine' Ending & Led To "A Day-And-A-Half Of Reshoots"](https://web.archive.org/web/20241120112416/https://deadline.com/2024/11/blake-lively-influenced-deadpool-and-wolverine-ending-1236182013/)

The film stars Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Josephine Quinn, Ebon Moss-Bacrach, Mark Ruffalo, Julia Garner and others in an ensemble cast. It will start Phase Six of the MCU, with Feige producing.

Feiged said that _Thunderbolts\*_, set to premiere in May 2025, is “what Marvel is all about.” The film stars the likes of Florence Pugh ads Yelena Belova, Sebastian Stan as Bucky Barnes and David Harbour as Red Guardian, who form an antihero group who perform missions from the U.S. government.

“It’s taking characters from all different types of places and franchises and putting them together,” he said. “That’s what the _Avengers_ is, that’s what _Guardians of the Galaxy_ is.”

On bringing the X-Men into the MCU, Feige said: “I think you will see that continues in our next few movies with some X-Men players that you might recognize. Right after that, the whole story of _Secret Wars_ really leads us into a new age of mutants and of the X-Men. Again, \[it’s\] one of those dreams come true. We finally have the X-Men back.”

Commenting on _Deadpool & Wolverine_, Feige said of Hugh Jackman’s role in the box office smash: “When we first started working on the film for the first time, we wanted to see Wolverine in a yellow costume. I had goosebumps on set when he walked out wearing that costume and put on that mask for the first time. I’ve been waiting 25 years to bring that to life.”

He added: “We were very excited to see Ryan Reynolds bring the R rating to Disney. It was fun — the heart and the humor.”

Disney’s two-day APAC showcase is highlighting the company’s 2025-2026 theatrical and streaming slate across Disney, 20th Century Studios, Searchlight Pictures, Walt Disney Animation Studios, Pixar, Lucasfilm and Marvel Studios portfolios, including titles from Korea and Japan. Feige was keen to talk up Asia’s importance to Marvel.

“The future of Marvel in Asia is the future of Marvel in general,” he said. “At Marvel Animation, we have some amazing shows, like the hit _X-Men ’97_, \[and\] we have a new Spider-Man animated series called _The Friendly Neighborhood Spider Man_, for which we are partnering with great animation studios in Japan and Korea.

“People may know I’m a huge Disney parks fan, and some of the best Disney parks are in Asia. Next year, we’ve got a Spider-Man attraction coming to Shanghai Disneyland and an Avengers attraction coming to Hong Kong Disneyland.”

He noted that Marvel Comics has been “influenced by manga and webtoons,” and pointed to upcoming title Deadpool: Samurai.”‘He noted that Marvel Comics has been “influenced by manga and webtoons,” and pointed to upcoming title ‘Deadpool: Samurai’.
