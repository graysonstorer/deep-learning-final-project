The Incredible Hulk Smashes onto Mobile Phones Worldwide
========================================================

 Hands-On Mobile and Marvel Entertainment bring The Incredible Hulk to mobile in conjunction with film release. 

By IGN Staff One of the world's most recognizable, iconic and enduring Super Heroes will make his move to the mobile platform when [The Incredible Hulk](http://wireless.ign.com/objects/142/14260048.html) hits theaters today. Hands-On Mobile, Inc., the world's leading developer of connected games and applications, and Marvel Entertainment, Inc., today announced the availability of a mobile game and personalization content around the big-screen adaptation of The Incredible Hulk. The game and content are currently available on select carriers worldwide.

"The Hulk is a character who is beloved by many, and we worked closely with Marvel to develop a mobile game that was true to his legacy," said David White, Chief Executive Officer, Hands-On Mobile. "Just as we've seen consumers embrace Iron Man, we expect [The Incredible Hulk](https://www.ign.com/games/the-incredible-hulk "The Incredible Hulk") to gain a similar following with an exciting mobile game to complement its film release."

In this explosive and action-packed mobile game, players become one of the most popular Super Heroes of all time. Smash through walls, hurl cars at enemies, scale cityscapes, dodge precision missiles, and battle The Abomination as you seek out a cure to the gamma radiation that poisoned your cells and transformed you into the unbridled force of rage known only as The Incredible Hulk.

"This summer is an exciting time for Marvel, and we are excited to be working with Hands-On Mobile to create mobile games that complement our latest big screen releases including Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk," said Simon Philips, President of Marvel International. "As we've already seen with the success of Iron Man, fans are eager to continue to interact with these beloved characters after they leave the movie theaters, and mobile games are a great way to do this."

The latest and best Marvel Mobile game from an enduring and beloved character franchise, The Incredible Hulk features unique gameplay that distinguishes it from other tile-based, action-adventure games in the mobile market. With fully interactive and destructible environments, the game re-creates movie scenes as players smash from the hidden factories of Brazil to the city that never sleeps.
