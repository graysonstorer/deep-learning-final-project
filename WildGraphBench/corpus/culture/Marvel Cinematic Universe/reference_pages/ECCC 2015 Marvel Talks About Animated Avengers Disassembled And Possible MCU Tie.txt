On the final day of Emerald City Comic Con 2015, Marvel opened up talk about their cartoon work in the "Marvel Animation Presents" panel.

Marvel's VP of Animation Development and Production and panel moderator Cort Lane kicked things off by showing a clip from the final episode of _Ultimate Spider-Man: Web Warriors_' "Spider-Verse" arc.

"You might see Spider-Girl, Miles Morales, and Spider-Man 2099 in the future," teased Cort.

The clip featured scenes from the 2099, Noir, and Spider-Ham chapters of the story.

"What's next for _Ultimate Spider-Man_ is, in July, we come back with new episodes and a new storyline entitled 'S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy,'" said Cort.

Many characters that Spider-Man has met through these past seasons, including Ka-Zar, Squirrel Girl, Triton from the Inhumans, and more will be joining an academy founded by Spider-Man and Nick Fury. The primary villain will be Arnim Zola, played by Mark Hamill.

Next up Lane talked about the upcoming _Avengers Assemble_ arc "Avengers Disassembled," which sees the team splintered by Ultron. He then premiered the first episode of the "Disassembled" arc.

The episode kicks off showing Spider-Man joining the Avengers after Captain America has departed, to fight the Adaptoid - who turns out to be controlled by Ultron.

A new costume for Captain America, based on his Winter Soldier duds is shown, as he arrives to save the day, operating as an agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.

Ultron comandeers a fleet of LMD's brought by Captain America, building an entire army in seconds.

Spider-Man uses a web shield to save the Avengers as Ultron brings down the Roxxon facility where the fight is taking place.

Ultron uses trickery to turn S.H.I.E.L.D. against the Avengers. Nick Fury picks up on the ruse, but not before launching a missile strike.

Next, Ultron enters Avengers Tower, seizing several Iron Man armors. Seeds of dissent are being sown between Black Widow and Hawkeye, as well as others.

Stark manages to trap Ultron with his spare armors - but it's just an LMD. Now he's actually got the armors under his control. He's also seized control of J.A.R.V.I.S.

Falcon saves the day by overriding Ultron's control, but it's too late. Ultron's army has arrived.

Stark enacts his "final protocol," destroying his labs and Avengers Tower to stop Ultron.

Cap and Stark are clearly building towards a conflict. Spider-Man is trying to hold things together. He's ditched the Avengers. Cap has called for a new Avengers team, seeing Black Widow, Falcon, and Hulk join his team.

The Avengers have officially disassembled, giving Ultron exactly what he wanted. And that's the end of the episode.

Time for fan Q&A.

A young fan asks whether the kid Avengers will be involved in "Avengers Disassembled". They will not.

Next, a fan asks about whether the animation team will produce something that takes place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

"I can't announce anything, but things are in the works," said Lane, calling out the upcoming Netflix series as a proof of concept for things that tie-in to the larger world.

A very young girl asks if the Avengers come back together.

"That would be spoiling it!" jokes Lane, before assuring the young fan that they will, but things will be different because of Captain America and Iron Man's differing philosophies.

A fan asks if any animated features geared at older audiences are upcoming.

Lane danced around the question, but once again called back to the Netflix series as a home for those fans. He did say that there are ideas, but it's hard to get them off the ground for financial reasons.

A fan asked about an X-Men cartoon, but Lane reminded the fan that the X-Men are controlled by Fox, including the animation side.

Lane has surprised the audience with a clip from the upcoming _Guardians of the Galaxy_ series, from a series of prequel shorts that show the origins of the Guardians before coming together. This clip shows what happened to Star-Lord after being beamed aboard the alien ship as a child, clearly taking cues from the film, but incorporating elements like Star-Lord's elemental blasters.

Up next is a clip from Rocket's chapter, featuring the origins of his relationship with Groot, as they break out of the experimental facility where Rocket was created.

And that's it from the Marvel Animation Presents panel.
