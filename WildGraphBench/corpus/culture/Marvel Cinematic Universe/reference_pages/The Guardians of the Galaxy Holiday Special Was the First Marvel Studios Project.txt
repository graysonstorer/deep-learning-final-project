“It is the first thing ever conceived from Marvel Studios for Disney Plus,” shared Kevin Feige in a new behind the scenes featurette. “On the set of [_Guardians of the Galaxy_] _Volume Two,_ James said, ‘We should do a h oliday special.’ We all had a laugh we thought it would be great. And then they wrote it in three days.”

I n the glimpses of Gunn’s holly jolly madness, we get more of a look at Drax and Mantis seeking out Kevin Bacon, the Ravagers learning about the spirit of the holidays, and buff boi Groot (who is now my new fave Groot).

While the _Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special_ was the first Disney+ Marvel Studios Special Presentation to be planned, it’s the second to be released. The first was Halloween’s [_Werewolf by Night_ directed by Michael Giacchino](https://web.archive.org/web/20221119072119/https://gizmodo.com/werewolf-by-night-mcu-giacchino-man-thing-moon-knight-1849602859), which introduced Gael Garcia Bernal as werewolf hero Jack Russell. It kicked off the television specials from the studios in a big way with pulpy genre, intrigue, and horror. Needless to say, w e’re expecting the same level of commitment for this next entry. And word is that the [_Guardians of the Galaxy Cosmic Rewind_](https://web.archive.org/web/20221119072119/https://gizmodo.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-cosmic-rewind-interview-imagine-1848908625) ride at Walt Disney World’s Epcot will also be getting in the festive spirit, with [a holiday mix-tape for the attraction](https://web.archive.org/web/20221119072119/https://www.marvel.com/articles/culture-lifestyle/guardians-of-the-galaxy-cosmic-rewind-holiday-overlay) just in time for the special’s release.
