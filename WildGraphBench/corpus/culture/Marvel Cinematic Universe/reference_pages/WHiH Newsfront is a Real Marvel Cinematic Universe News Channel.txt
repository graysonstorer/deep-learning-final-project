WHiH Newsfront is a Real Marvel Cinematic Universe News Channel
===============================================================

by [Alanna Smith](https://web.archive.org/web/20160420100842/http://www.geekchicelite.com/author/alanna/)on July 19, 2015

[![Image 12: WHiH_News_Front](https://web.archive.org/web/20160420100842im_/http://www.geekchicelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WHiH_News_Front-e1437347249929.png)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160420100842/http://www.geekchicelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WHiH_News_Front-e1437347249929.png)

Part of what makes the**Marvel Cinematic Universe**so great is that it’s, well, a _universe._ The **MCU**spans across films, shorts, tv shows, **Netflix** series, and of course ties into certain comics, but it also finds ways to be even more interactive by merging with the real world. In this case, by taking the news channel that exists within its films and shows and actually making it accessible to viewers.

**WHiH World News** is a TV network based in Atlanta that reports on all forms of world news. It’s a subsidiary of Vistacorp, a company you’ll hear mention of in _Ant-Man_. You’ve actually seen them more than you might realize because they’ve been reporting **MCU** events from the very beginning. We see their correspondents reporting on the aftermath of the Culver University Hulk incident (_Incredible Hulk_), the Stark Expo opening ceremonies (_Iron Man 2_), the improvement of Hell’s Kitchen (_Daredevil_), the fall of SHIELD (_Agents of SHIELD_), Senator Ward’s debate (_AoS_) and the Battle of Sokovia (_AoS_).

[![Image 14: christine everhart iron man](https://web.archive.org/web/20160420100842im_/http://www.geekchicelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2008_iron_man_046-1024x683.jpg)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160420100842/http://www.geekchicelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/2008_iron_man_046.jpg)Recently, the network started a cross media online program called **WHiH Newsfront**, which delivers short news segments on **YouTube** supported by posts on **[Twitter](https://web.archive.org/web/20160420100842/https://twitter.com/WHIHOfficial)** and **[Google+](https://web.archive.org/web/20160420100842/https://plus.google.com/b/110393440896848459186/+whihnews/posts?pageId=110393440896848459186)**. And it’s hosted by none other than Christine Everhart. Remember her? She was the former Vanity Fair reporter that interviewed Tony Stark in _Iron Man_.If you go to [**WHiH Newsfront**‘s YouTube page](https://web.archive.org/web/20160420100842/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtJkDqZzoOFYbqwOIFn2Lng), you’ll see her segments on the Battle of Sokovia, a story on criminal Scott Lang (including exclusive security footage), an interview with Pym Technologies CEO Darren Cross and another interview with Scott Lang himself.

[![Image 15: WHIHCover](https://web.archive.org/web/20160420100842im_/http://www.geekchicelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WHIHCover.png)](https://web.archive.org/web/20160420100842/http://www.geekchicelite.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/WHIHCover.png)Personally, when I found out about this channel I couldn’t help but laugh out of disbelief and awe towards the **Marvel** team. I mean come on, real online broadcasts of the news channel that it turns out has been there from the start, and it’s hosted by the same side character (whom we probably didn’t even think would be back) from the startup**MCU**film made _7 years ago_?When **Marvel** says “It’s All Connected” they don’t mess around; they really mean _everything_.

Check out this interview of Scott Lang, and be sure to keep an eye on the very interesting headlines at the bottom.

[### Alanna Smith](https://web.archive.org/web/20160420100842/http://www.geekchicelite.com/author/alanna/ "See all posts from this author")I was a geek before I knew what the word even meant. What started as a childhood love of fantasy evolved into a fondness for sci-fi, movies, comics, and video games, with conventions and cosplay joining the mix later on. Outside of the geek realm, I'm a filmmaker and video editor. I'm a cosplayer, a huge fan of everything Marvel and DC and I have a deep love for Avatar: The Last Airbender and The Legend of Korra. Other fandoms include The Walking Dead, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and too many others to name.
