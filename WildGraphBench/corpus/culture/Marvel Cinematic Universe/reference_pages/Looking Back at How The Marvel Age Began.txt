Looking back at how the Marvel Age began.
-----------------------------------------

→  November 4, 2014 Airing Tuesday night in Agents of SHIELD's usual timeslot, Marvel: 75 Years, From Pulp to Pop! certainly won't be mistaken for an in-depth, warts and all version of Marvel's history (for that, read Sean Howe's excellent Marvel Comics: The Untold Story book). No, this is a 44-minute special, airing on a Disney-owned network about a Disney-owned company, and there is certainly a lot of self-congratulatory moments involved - especially with the segments that bookend the special, talking about all of Marvel Studio's success in film.

There's also the fact that if you're a pretty big Marvel comics fan (and the chances of that are higher if you're reading IGN than if you're say, a random moviegoer who liked The Avengers a lot) than you know the history of Marvel that is detailed here - including a lot of the specifics delved into, such as the story of how Stan Lee wrote Fantastic Four as a sort of last ditch effort in an industry he'd grown fed up with, after being encouraged to do so by his wife.

IGN Conversations

But the fact is, most people don't know all this - certainly most ABC viewers probably don't. And as a look at the conception of Marvel, this is a well-made special. Hosted by Revenge's Emily VanCamp (herself now a part of the Marvel family, thanks to Captain America: The Winter Soldier), From Pulp to Pop! spends a good portion of its running time on the early years of Marvel, from 1939 up through the 1960s, when the work of Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko changed everything.

Given the sometimes troubled history among these guys and the feeling some have that Lee's been given sole credit too many times, comic aficionados will be very happy that Kirby and Ditko get a lot of mentions here and are properly held up alongside Lee as the co-creators of the classic, 60s-era Marvel characters. Not shockingly, the ever-reclusive Ditko is nowhere to be seen, but along with Lee himself, Jack Kirby's son, Neal Kirby, is featured frequently in the interview segments, speaking about his father's beloved work.

Longtime Marvel fans will be very impressed by the array of Marvel creators, past and present, who participate in interviews here - folks like Steve Englehart, Dennis O'Neil, Jim Starlin, Larry Hama, Brian Bendis and many, many more take part. However, given the limited running time, some of these creators are only seen briefly, making me hope that Marvel has plans to use the material they shot with these guys (for what I assume were much longer interviews than what we see here) in some other way at some point.

Trailer

For those looking to see new material related to the MCU, temper your expectations - there is some new behind-the-scenes footage from Avengers: Age of Ultron and Ant-Man, which certainly offer some intriguing things (including the first publicly revealed footage, outside of San Diego Comic-Con, of Michael Douglas in Ant-Man), but no actual scenes are shown.

However, there is some actual footage shown from Agent Carter - the same fun sequence involving Peggy Carter, Howard Stark and Edwin Jarvis shown previously only to New York Comic Con attendees, along with the same brief glimpse at a fight scene shown at NYCC. (You can see our description and reaction to that footage in the video below)

Feature

I do wish the special were two hours. With so much time understandably spent on the early days, later eras begin to be rushed through. There's some interesting talk about the rise of darker heroes, such as Punisher and Wolverine, going into the 1980s, but then a lot is skipped over - to the point that when they talk about Marvel's financial issues by the end of the 1990s, it's not made exactly clear what got them there except for some unspecific talk about bad decisions.

Oh, and for those paying attention to how much Marvel are discussing the characters they don't have movie rights to, it should be noted that the Fantastic Four, X-Men and Spider-Man all get their due in terms of their importance to Marvel Comics - but that the X-Men and Spider-Man movies (which were so integral to bringing about the huge push of comic book movies in general) aren't talked about at all, even as they go into detail about the launch of Marvel Studios and the production of Iron Man as being important as far as Marvel beginning to make movies themselves.

### The Verdict

Understandably, the more you already know about Marvel, the less you'll be surprised by Marvel: 75 Years, From Pulp to Pop!, but it's important to remember who this special is really made for - a mainstream audience who have embraced the Marvel characters, via the hugely successful movies, in a way no one could have imagined. One of the interview participants in the special (I believe Seth Green, who is among the celebrities interviewedl) notes how much things have changed when so many people now wear Marvel shirts and know who all these characters are - and the fact that this special fills them in on where they came from is certainly a good thing.

Marvel: 75 Years, From Pulp to Pop! airs Tuesday, November 4th at 9:00pm ET/PT on ABC.

Eric Goldman 4 Nov 2014

*   +Impressive array of Marvel Comics creators, past and present.
*   +Goes into the origins of Marvel, through the 1960s especially, in an entertaining, well told manner.

*   – With limited time, the 1980s and 90s especially are rushed through.
*   – Inevitably perhaps, there's a lot of self-congratulation.
