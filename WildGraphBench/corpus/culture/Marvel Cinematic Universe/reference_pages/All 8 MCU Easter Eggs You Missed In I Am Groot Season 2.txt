Warning! This post contains SPOILERS for I Am Groot season 2

[**_I Am Groot_**](https://screenrant.com/tag/i-am-groot/) season 2 has been released, featuring a collection of fun Easter eggs and MCU references across its five all-new episodes. Featuring the titular Groot (Vin Diesel) when he was still a small sapling, _I Am Groot_ season 1 was set in the aftermath of _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_, and the same is true for this new season as well. To that end, Baby Groot fans now have even more adorable misadventures to enjoy with some great Easter eggs along the way.

As featured in [_I Am Groot_ season 2](https://screenrant.com/i-am-groot-episodes-ranked/), the episodes range from being as innocuous as Baby Groot wanting to buy ice cream to as momentous as the smallest Guardian of the Galaxy fulfilling a cosmic prophecy. Keeping that in mind, Baby Groot's new collection of short solo adventures are incredibly humorous and entertaining during his years as a flora not-quite-colossus. Here are all the hidden Easter eggs and MCU references viewers might have missed the first time watching _I Am Groot_ season 2.

8 Candies From GOTG Vol 2
-------------------------

![Image 2: Baby Groot eating candy in Guardians of the Galaxy 2](https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Baby-Groot-eating-candy-in-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-2.jpg)

_I Am Groot_ season 2, episode 1 is entitled "Are You My Groot?" This first adventure features Baby Groot exploring the planet Terma (a world referenced by Rocket in _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_). As such, he quickly encounters a baby bird native to the planet whom he quickly bonds with, trying to raise it as only Baby Groot possibly can. This includes feeding the baby bird some of his multicolored candies.

This isn't the first time the candies have been featured in the MCU. They're most notably featured in _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_ being casually eaten by Baby Groot while the Guardians are crash-landing on the planet Berhert. While they aren't Skittles, James Gunn has confirmed that Baby Groot inherited Star-Lord's love of space candy as wrappers can be seen all over the Guardians' ship in multiple movies.

7 The Fake Leg from GOTG
------------------------

_I Am Groot_ season 2, episode 2 is entitled "Groot Noses Around". While searching for new batteries for his video game controller, Groot inadvertently gains a prosthetic nose which grants him a brand-new sense of smell that he both enjoys and detests (depending on what he's smelling). However, the nose was featured in a bin full of prosthetics, including the fake leg Rocket told Star-Lord he needed for their prison breakout in the first _Guardians of the Galaxy_ movie. In truth, Rocket only needed it because he thought it was funny along with his love of prosthetics ([such as Rocket's love for Bucky Barnes' cybernetic arm](https://screenrant.com/i-am-groot-buckys-arm-winter-soldier/)).

6 The Fake Eye from GOTG Vol 2
------------------------------

![Image 4: Groot and Fake Eye](https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/groot-and-fake-eye.jpg)

The bin of prosthetics aboard _The Benatar_ also has the fake eye Groot brought to Yondu and Rocket in _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_ instead of the prototype fin Yondu was asking for. This was one of Baby Groot's very first solo adventures, so it's a pretty fun callback now that he has his own series. Likewise, the prosthetics still being on the Guardians' ship speaks to Rocket's strange sense of humor. While it would have been nice to see the arm Rocket got for Christmas that was stolen from Bucky Barnes, the [_Guardians of the Galaxy_ _Holiday_ _Special_](https://screenrant.com/infinity-war-rocket-bucky-arm-guardians-galaxy-special/) hasn't happened yet at this point in the MCU timeline.

5 Skrulls And More Marvel Characters in Groot's Video Game
----------------------------------------------------------

Once Groot makes it back to his game in _I am Groot_ season 2, episode 2, the videogame in question looks to be a fighting game between a Skrull and what may be a Kree warrior. Additionally, Howard the Duck can be seen as one of the 8-bit fans cheering in the background. Having first appeared at the end of the first _Guardians of the Galaxy_, [Howard the Duck (voiced by Seth Green)](https://screenrant.com/howard-duck-mcu-movie-tv-appear-easter-egg-every/) has made multiple cameo appearances in the MCU ever since.

4 Rocket's Voice Cameo
----------------------

Titled "Groot's Snow Day", _I Am Groot_ season 2, episode 3 features Baby Groot ending a long (and quite dangerous) day in the snow with a cup of hot chocolate. However, the cup is apparently too hot for Baby Groot, motivating him to chuck the mug in anger where Rocket's voice can be heard off-screen, apparently having been the unfortunate recipient of the projectile. Likewise, the credits confirm actor Bradley Cooper returned for the voice cameo. It's also worth noting that Groot's fun in the snow happened on Falligar, the same world where Thor and Korg discovered the slain deity of the same name in _Thor:_ _Love and Thunder._

3 Howard The Duck & Arishem Ice Creams
--------------------------------------

![Image 7: I Am Groot Season 2 Arishem Ice Cream](https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/i-am-groot-season-2-arishem-ice-cream.jpg)

Howard the Duck is referenced yet again in _I Am Groot_ season 2 with the fourth episode "Groot's Sweet Treat". Not only does a passing ship resembling an ice cream truck carry ice cream that looks like Howard, but they also have [ice cream resembling the Celestial known as Arishem](https://screenrant.com/i-am-groot-arishem-thanos-ice-cream/) from _Eternals_. Desperately searching for money to get his ice cream before the ship leaves, the episode is quite funny with a showcase of Baby Groot's pure determination (which also ends up being quite destructive).

2 Groot's Nova Corps Action Figure
----------------------------------

![Image 8: I Am Groot Season 2 Nova Corp Action Figure](https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/i-am-groot-season-2-nova-corp-action-figure.jpg)

A very funny element from "Groot's Sweet Treat" is that the short adventure begins with Groot playing with an action figure and a can. The action figure itself is a Nova Corps officer with the peacekeepers having made their debut in the first _Guardians of the Galaxy_. However, the hilarious part is that the actual Nova Corps were called to investigate after Baby Groot jumped into _The Benatar's_ pod to catch up with the ice cream ship.

Despite the episode only showing the aftermath, it seems Groot literally crashed the pod into the ship and destroyed it in the process. While he did get his Arishem ice cream bar, the episode ended with Groot in trouble with the authorities. As such, the Nova Corps effectively book-ending the short adventure is very funny and quite clever.

1 The Watcher
-------------

![Image 9: Groot and the Watcher In MCU](https://static1.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/groot-and-the-watcher-in-mcu.jpg)

The final episode of _I Am Groot_ season 2 is entitled "Groot and the Great Prophecy". Narrated by The Watcher himself (Jeffery Wright), it's very funny to see the cosmic observer growing completely exasperated with Baby Groot and his antics. Despite the existence of a great prophecy that claimed saving an important seed would save the universe, Groot continually distracting himself leads to the seed being destroyed to the Watcher's dismay.

However, the Watcher realizes that the seed and its great potential to save the universe is metaphorical and that [Baby Groot himself is the true seed](https://screenrant.com/i-am-groot-season-2-ending-powers-prophecy/). Thankfully, the universe is not doomed following the final episode in **_I Am Groot_** season 2. The episode also teased that Baby Groot could see the Watcher despite his status as a 5th-dimensional being, ironically confirming Groot's heightened cosmic awareness (despite his hilariously short attention span).
