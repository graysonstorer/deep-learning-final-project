_Black Panther:_ _Wakanda_ _Foreve_ r has added [Dominique Thorne](https://comicbook.com/category/dominique-thorne/) to its cast, the actress who will be playing Ironheart in the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://comicbook.com/category/marvel-cinematic-universe/). Thorne had previously been announced as the MCU's Riri Williams for the hero's self-titled _[Ironheart](https://comicbook.com/category/ironheart/)_ series coming to Disney+. Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige has confirmed to ComicBook.com that Thorne will make her MCU debut as Ironheart ahead of the release of her self-titled series.

"We're shooting _[Black Panther: Wakanda Forever](https://comicbook.com/category/black-panther-wakanda-forever/)_, right now, and the character of Riri Williams, you will meet in _Black Panther 2_ first," Feige said in an interview surrounding the release of _Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings_. "She started shooting, I think, this week before her _[Ironheart](https://comicbook.com/category/ironheart/)_ series."

In the Marvel Comics universe, Riri Williams is a teen-aged engineering genius who designs her own version of an Iron Man suit. Following her father's death, she lives with her mother and her aunt in Chicago. At 15 years old, she gets herself accepted into MIT. It is there that she builds her own version of an Iron Man-style armor. After using the armor to stop two escaped prison inmates, Tony Stark reaches out to her and gives her his blessing to become a new, armored hero, yet there is no indication that Robert Downey Jr. or Tony Stark will be a part of the character's story in the MCU right now.

The character first appeared in comics in cameo form for 2016's _Invincible Iron Man_ #7. She soon after made a full appearance in _Invincible Iron Man_ #9. Marvel Studios boss announced Thorne as Riri Wiliams during Disney's Investor Day meeting back in December of 2020. How big of a role Williams will play in _Black Panther: Wakanda Foreve_ r is currently unclear.

[_Black Panther: Wakanda_ _Foreve_ r recently began production](https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/black-panther-wakanda-forever-production-officially-starts/) in Atlanta. Ryan Coogler returned to direct, following the huge success of the first _Black Panther_ movie from 2018. In the wake of T'Challa actor Chadwick Boseman's passing, the original cast, including Letitia Wright, Angela Bassett, Danai Gurira, Florence Kasumba, Daniel Kaluuya Winston Duke, Lupita Nyong'o, and Martin Freeman, are expected to be returning. Additional new cast members include Tenoch Huerta as Namor, as well as yet to be cast roles for Marvel Comics characters Attuma and Namora.

_Black Panther: Wakanda Forever_ will be Ironheart's live-action debut. The character has appeared in animated shows including in _Marvel Rising: Heart of Iron_ and the _Spider-Man_ episode "Amazing Friends." She's also appeared in Marvel Entertainment video games includes _Marvel Puzzle Quest_, _Marvel Future Fight_, _Marvel Avengers Academy_, _LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2_, and _Marvel Strike Force_. She is one of several young heroes to be making their way to the MCU, following the additions of Cassie Lang in the _Ant-Man_ movies, Billy and Tommy Maximoff in _WandaVision_, Eli Bradley in _The_ _Falcon and the Winter Soldier_, Kid Loki in _Loki_, and Yelena Belova in _Black Widow_. Still to come are Kate Bishop in _Hawkeye_ and Kamala Khan in _Ms. Marvel._

_[Black Panther: Wakanda Forever](https://comicbook.com/category/black-panther-wakanda-forever/)_ is set to hit theaters on July 8, 2022. _Ironheart_ does not yet have a premiere date on Disney+. _Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings_ opens in theaters on September 3.
