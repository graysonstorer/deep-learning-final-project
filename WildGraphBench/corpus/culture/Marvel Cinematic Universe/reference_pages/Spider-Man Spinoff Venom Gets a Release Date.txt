_Venom_, Columbia’s long-in-the-works _Spider-Man_ spinoff, now has a opening date.

The studio on Thursday announced it has set Oct. 5, 2018, as the release date of that comic book movie. It had previously announced its _Girl With the Dragon Tattoo_ sequel, _The Girl in the Spider’s Web_, as bowing on that date, but then bumped it to Oct. 19, 2018.

The setting of _Venom_'s release date happened the same day that Warner Bros. moved _Aquaman_ off of Oct. 5, 2018, to Dec. 18, 2018.

_Venom_ has no director yet, but it does have a script; Scott Rosenberg and Jeff Pinkner, the latter of whom worked on 2014’s _The Amazing Spider-Man 2_, recently turned in a draft. (Dante Harper wrote a previous draft.)

Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach, among the stewards of the _Spider-Man_ properties, are producing and overseeing the project. Amy Pascal is also producing.

Venom has been one of Marvel’s top villains and a Spider-Man fixture since he was introduced in 1988, created by writer David Michelinie and artists Todd McFarlane and Mike Zeck. The character is an alien symbiote that needs a human host to survive. In return, the alien vests its victim with incredible powers. He made his first big-screen appearance in Sam Raimi's _Spider-Man 3_ and was portrayed by Topher Grace.

The studio hopes to launch a franchise with _Venom_.
