It’s Finally All Connected: How ‘Avengers: Endgame’ Finally Acknowledged the MCU’s TV Universe
==============================================================================================

Latest Marvel Studios film included a surprising shout out to “Agent Carter”

_**(Spoiler warning: Please don’t read this if you don’t want to know details about “Avengers: Endgame” and how it connects to the Marvel TV shows.)**_

“Avengers: Endgame” features many, many cameos — but only one that finally consummated the relationship between the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the ABC television shows starring Marvel characters.

When Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) travels back to a S.H.I.E.L.D. base in 1970 to retrieve the Tesseract, he runs into his dad, Howard Stark (John Slattery). Stark the elder asks his driver why Tony seems so familiar. But the driver is familiar too: Fans of ABC’s short-lived “Agent Carter” recognized him as Edwin Jarvis, played by James D’Arcy.

In the first episode of “Agent Carter,” a young Howard Stark (this one played by Dominic Cooper from “Captain America: The First Avenger”) lent Jarvis’ services to Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell). We know how important his service was to the Stark family, given that Tony Stark gave the name Jarvis to his first A.I. program — a kind of high-tech butler.

But Jarvis’ big moment in“Endgame” proved his commitment to _fan_ service. It marked the first time that Marvel Studios has referenced anything specifically from Marvel TV’s MCU-adjacent universe. Until now, it’s been a one-way relationship, with the TV shows referencing the films, but the films ignoring the shows. That has led to questions about whether the events of the TV shows are canon to the MCU, even though Disney owns them all.

In 2013, ABC began airing Marvel’s “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” in which Clark Gregg reprised his role as Agent Phil Coulson from the films. Though the series was able to land to a few cameos from Cobie Smolders and Samuel L. Jackson in its first season, the MCU connections were a one-way street.

Despite Marvel TV chief Jeph Loeb’s often-stated assurance, “It’s all connected,” the connection between the films and TV shows often felt tenuous.“Captain America: The Winter Soldier” even introduced a conspiracy that seemed to threaten the premise of “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.”

The separation is even built into the corporate org chart: Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige reports directly to Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn, instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO Ike Perlmutter, who controls Marvel TV.

Maybe we shouldn’t even talk about the Netflix shows “Daredevil,” “Jessica Jones,” “Luke Cage,” “Iron Fist,” “The Punisher” and “The Defenders.” Though they take place in New York City, site of the climactic battle of the first “Avengers” film, they only occasionally mentioned people like “The Green Guy” or “The Guy With the Shield.” And of course, none of the big-screen heroes ever mentioned the street-level adventures of the Netflix heroes.

But you can expect [much more synergy](https://www.thewrap.com/avengers-endgame-mcu-future-disney-plus-hawkeye-loki-wandavision-winter-soldier/) in the near future. Big-screen stars Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan), Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Vision (Paul Bettany), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are all coming to Disney+. Bucky and Falcon will pair off in their own series “Falcon and The Winter Solider”, as will Vision and Scarlet Witch in “WandaVision.” Loki will continue his mischief in his self-titled series, and a fourth featuring Renner’s Clint Barton [training a new Hawkeye,](https://www.thewrap.com/hawkeye-series-with-jeremy-renner-in-development-at-disney/)Kate Bishop, is being developed.

The goal is to recreate the big-screen experience for home streaming, in a more cohesive way than the MCU ever did with ABC or Netflix. For starters, the Disney+ series are being led by Feige and Marvel Studios, rather than Marvel TV.

But at least Loeb can thank Jarvis for finally being proven right: It’s all connected after all.

Is There a New ‘SNL’ Episode Airing This Week?
==============================================

Here’s what you need to know about what’s happening this week with “Saturday Night Live”

[Phil Owen](https://www.thewrap.com/author/phil-owen/ "Posts by Phil Owen") | March 12, 2021 @ 8:24 PM

![Image 17: snl is there a new saturday night live episode airing this week](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/snl-is-there-a-new-saturday-night-live-episode-airing-this-week.jpg)
NBC

“SNL” is back, now deep into its 46th season. The most recent new episode, which aired on Feb. 27, was hosted by Nick Jonas, who also acted as the [musical guest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12akdhW8OEs). The cold open sketch saw cast member Aidy Bryant once again dress up as Ted Cruz for [a game show in which contestants win the COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.thewrap.com/snl-kate-mckinnons-dr-fauci-hosts-vaccine-game-show/).

Since Donald Trump lost the election and is now all the way out of office, Alec Baldwin very well might be done playing Trump. He hasn’t appeared since the episode immediately after the election in November — he held up a little “Thank you” sign at the end of it.

But with Trump’s impeachment trial over — and once again making some TV appearances and speeches — it seems like it’s certainly possible he could pop back up on “SNL” at some point.

This week, on Saturday, March 13, **there WILL NOT be a new episode of “SNL.”**After five straight new episodes in January and February, “SNL” is going to take a long break — it’ll return on March 27, when former cast member Maya Rudolph will host, likely with her Kamala Harris impression in tow.

As is usually the case on off-weeks, NBC will air two “SNL” re-runs on Saturday. First, at 1o p.m. on both the east and west coasts, will be a re-air of the season 43 episode hosted by former cast member Bill Hader, with Arcade Fire as the musical guest.

Then at 11:30 in the normal show slot, we’ll get a re-run of an episode from this current season.

You can be pretty sure this season of “SNL” be very political for the full stretch. While it’s no longer an election year, somehow the tense political situation in the U.S. has managed to ramp up from the fever pitch it was at in 2020, thanks to the mob of terrorists who invaded the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. “SNL” will, as it always does, follow the discourse.

And, well, it’s tough to pass up [having Aidy Bryant play Ted Cruz](https://www.thewrap.com/snl-aidy-bryant-plays-ted-cruz-in-impeachment-cold-open-video/) as often as possible, which [the show keeps doing](https://www.thewrap.com/snl-aidy-bryants-ted-cruz-apologizes-to-britney-spears-for-cancun-vacation-video/).

Perhaps the biggest splash of season 46 was the addition of Jim Carrey as the show’s resident celebrity Joe Biden during the election cycle. But Carrey dropped out of the role after Trump lost, and “SNL” revealed its new Biden just before the holiday hiatus: cast member Alex Moffat. Moffat has not made any appearances as Biden since — no one has — so it’s not clear if they’ll stick with him.

The premiere episode came out hard with political commentary, with the [debate cold open](https://www.thewrap.com/snl-debate-parody-cold-open-mostly-ignores-trumps-covid-19-diagnosis-video/), [a very political monologue](https://www.thewrap.com/snl-chris-rock-jokes-his-heart-goes-out-to-covid-because-of-trump-diagnosis/) from Chris Rock, and a [stunned discussion of Trump’s COVID-19 infection](https://www.thewrap.com/snl-michael-che-says-theres-a-lot-funny-about-trump-getting-covid-19/) from Michael Che on Weekend Update.

**Also Read:**['SNL' Newsmax Sports Parody Perfectly Sums Up Pro-Trump Conspiracy Logic (Video)](https://www.thewrap.com/snl-newsmax-sports-parody-perfectly-sums-up-pro-trump-conspiracy-logic-video/)

And “SNL” hasn’t slowed down with its political content, with each cold open in season 46 being about the election, its aftermath or, as we saw in the last episode, the COVID-19 vaccine. After that debate sketch in the premiere, we got two other debate sketches, [one for the VP candidates](https://www.thewrap.com/snl-cold-open-reveals-jim-carreys-joe-biden-was-the-fly-on-mike-pences-head/) and [one other for the presidential candidates](https://www.thewrap.com/snl-maya-rudolph-moderates-last-debate-between-jim-carrey-and-alec-baldwin-as-a-drinking-game/), as well as one about[the dueling town halls](https://www.thewrap.com/snl-biden-trump-town-hall-wrestlemania-qanon/) from when Trump was infected with COVID-19 and refused to submit to safety measures.

The show’s writers were obviously pleased with the election results as well — [the cold open sketch in the episode after Election Day was certainly celebratory](https://www.thewrap.com/snl-celebrates-bidens-victory-baldwins-trump-sings-macho-man-sadly-video/). That sketch also parodied the episode after the 2016 election in which Kate McKinnon took the stage as Hillary Clinton and played piano while singing “Hallelujah” — this time, Baldwin, as Trump, performed a mournful version of “Macho Man.”

Maher Doesn’t Buy Everything Meghan Markle Said in Oprah Interview (Video)
==========================================================================

Maher also draws a connection between royal family racism and incest on “Real Time”

[Ross A. Lincoln](https://www.thewrap.com/author/ross/ "Posts by Ross A. Lincoln") and [Phil Owen](https://www.thewrap.com/author/phil-owen/ "Posts by Phil Owen") | March 12, 2021 @ 8:17 PM

Like everyone else, Bill Maher has been paying attention to the continuing fallout from Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s Oprah interview last Sunday. And he spent a lot of time on Friday’s episode of “Real Time” talking about it, including the fact that he is skeptical about some of what Markle said about her experience with the royal family.

Not the accusations of racism of course, which he did believe. Instead he was referring to her claims regarding what she did and didn’t know about her now-husband’s family before they met.

“Also this week, we finally got some clarity on the most pressing issue of our time: Did Meghan make Kate cry or did Kate make Meghan cry?” Maher said, kicking off the bit. “Tell me now so I know who we’re not talking to at lunch. I never understood this fixation with the royal family, but boy this week you’re all talking about it. You can’t avoid it.”

“You can hate the racism but not love them for everything else,” Maher said about the interview itself. “You know, I mean, I mean Meghan did claim that before dating Harry she never googled him, and she said she didn’t know much about the Royal Family. Yeah in the first three dates, she thought he was Ed Sheeran.”

“Come on Meghan, you filmed your television show for years in Toronto,” Maher continued. “Every time you bought a mochaccino you used coins with your mother-in-law’s face on it.”

Then he touched on one of the most disturbing accusations of racism, and used it to get into a joke at the royal family’s expense. “But of course the big bombshell — not that it’s not that big a bombshell — that there’s horrible racism, just terrible, in the Royal Family,” he said. “And I’m sure it was very painful, and members of the royal hierarchy she said were actually asking her, you know, when she was pregnant how dark the baby’s skin would be. And the queen said — problematic — she said ‘this is why we’ve always discouraged sex outside the family.'”

Later in the episode, Maher revisited the topic with his panel guests Larry Wilmore and Scott Galloway — and also dropped in a shout out to TheWrap along theway.

“In January of last year, right before the pandemic, we did an editorial about it because they had just announced they were stepping back. And I said, why don’t you two, just instead of just stepping back, why don’t you just renounce the whole bulls—, the lock, stock and barrel of it? What is this royal bulls— to begin with?” Maher said.

“People calling each other ‘your highness’? What could be less woke than that? Where are the woke people on that one? Your highness? How gross. And then like the next day — show that headline, we have a headline here that just shows you… there, see,” Maher continued. At which point, we’ll pause to note, he displayed an image of TheWrap’s coverage of the topic:

Now, back to Maher:

“And then like the next day they did it, and I thought oh well, they heard me,” he added. “No. I see that they’re just mad that their family was mean to them. They don’t want to renounce royalty. And they still act kind of regal.”

“Yeah it is interesting that that did come out that way and, you know, people were saying, well, did they say that about the baby, and all that about wanting to know how dark the baby’s gonna be? I’m like, a thousand percent, absolutely,” Wilmore said in response. “Not only does somebody say that — they were all thinking it. They’re the royal family. It’s not ‘Bridgeton,’ you know. The tabloid press is gonna cover this, not Lady Whistleddown or whoever that is.”

Then Galloway chimed in. “A white guy’s hundred year old grandparents who traveled to hunt stags in Range Rovers have a racial bias? That’s news?” he joked.

“But I must say, for everyone who’s like, ‘There’s racial bias in the royal family!’ There are other royal families in the world. Americans only seem to be interested in the white one,” Maher added.

Chris Harrison Won’t Return as Host for ‘The Bachelorette’
==========================================================

Tayshia Adams and Kaitlyn Bristowe will step in for the upcoming season

[Reid Nakamura](https://www.thewrap.com/author/reid-nakamura/ "Posts by Reid Nakamura") | March 12, 2021 @ 7:42 PM

![Image 25: CHRIS HARRISON](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Chris-Harrison.jpg)
ABC/Craig Sjodin

Former Bachelorettes Tayshia Adams and Kaitlyn Bristowe will step in for Chris Harrison as co-hosts of the upcoming season of “The Bachelorette,” ABC and Warner Horizon said in a joint statement on Friday.

“Chris Harrison will not be hosting the next season of ‘The Bachelorette,'” the studio and network said. “We support Chris in the work that he is committed to doing. In his absence, former Bachelorettes Tayshia Adams and Kaitlyn Bristowe will support the new Bachelorette through next season. As we continue the dialogue around achieving greater equity and inclusion within ‘The Bachelor’ franchise, we are dedicated to improving the BIPOC representation of our crew, including among the executive producer ranks. These are important steps in effecting fundamental change so that our franchise is a celebration of love that is reflective of our world.”

The announcement comes as Harrison’s future as the face of the “Bachelor” franchise remains the subject of much speculation. The host [temporarily stepped aside](https://www.thewrap.com/chris-harrison-stepping-aside-as-bachelor-host-after-excusing-contestants-racism/) from the program last month after fans called into question the show’s handling of race and criticized Harrison for an interview with former “Bachelorette” star Rachel Lindsay in which he appeared to defend a contestant’s racist actions. Emmanuel Acho was [later tapped](https://www.thewrap.com/emmanuel-acho-to-replace-chris-harrison-as-host-of-the-bachelor-after-the-final-rose/) to replace him for the upcoming live “Bachelor” season finale and “After the Final Rose” special.

Harrison has [apologized for the interview](https://www.thewrap.com/chris-harrison-stepping-aside-as-bachelor-host-after-excusing-contestants-racism/), saying he is “dedicated to getting educated on a more profound and productive level than ever before.”

“I also apologize to my friend Rachel Lindsay for not listening to her better on a topic she has a first-hand understanding of, and humbly thank the members of Bachelor Nation who have reached out to me to hold me accountable. I promise to do better,” he said.

Whether or not Harrison will return to the franchise down the road remains unclear, but Harrison has expressed a desire to return. “I plan to be back, and I want to be back,” he [said in a recent interview](https://www.thewrap.com/chris-harrison-plans-return-bachelor-host-rachel-lindsay-matt-james-rachael-kirckconnell-good-morning-america-interview-video/) on “Good Morning America.” “This interview is not the finish line. There is much more work to be done and I’m excited to be a part of that change.”

‘The Talk’ Under Internal Review Amid Sharon Osbourne Racism Controversy
========================================================================

“We are committed to a diverse, inclusive and respectful workplace,” network says in a statement

CBS is currently reviewing “all matters” related to Sharon Osbourne’s defense of Piers Morgan on “The Talk” this week and the subsequent backlash.

“We are committed to a diverse, inclusive and respectful workplace. All matters related to the Wednesday episode of ‘The Talk’ are currently under internal review,” the network said in a statement Friday.

Osbourne [came under fire earlier this week](https://www.thewrap.com/sharon-osbourne-apologizes-the-talk-piers-morgan-defense-racism-meghan-markle-sheryl-underwood/) after her public defense of longtime friend Piers Morgan led to an on-air meltdown and an emotional conversation with co-host Sheryl Underwood about race on Wednesday.

In the run-up to the episode, Osbourne voiced support for Morgan on social media after the “Good Morning Britain” commentator was [called out](https://www.thewrap.com/piers-morgan-quits-good-morning-britain-after-meghan-markle-blowup/) for his disparaging statements about Meghan Markle.

Osbourne then said on-air that she felt as though she was “about to be put in the electric chair because I have a friend who many people think is a racist, so that makes me a racist.” She further pushed back when Underwood, who is Black, attempted to explain how [Morgan’s treatment of Markle](https://www.thewrap.com/piers-morgan-meghan-markle-feud-attacks-timeline/) could be interpreted as racist and sexist.

“When you have heard him say racist things?” Osbourne exclaimed. “Educate me! Tell me!”

Osbourne [later apologized](https://www.thewrap.com/sharon-osbourne-apologizes-the-talk-piers-morgan-defense-racism-meghan-markle-sheryl-underwood/) in a lengthy statement on Twitter, writing, “I panicked, felt blindsided, got defensive & allowed my fear & horror of being accused of being racist take over.”

“Please hear me when I say I do not condone racism, misogyny or bullying,” she wrote. “I should have been more specific about that in my tweet. I will always support freedom of speech, but now I see how I unintentionally didn’t make that clear distinction.”

For his part, Morgan said Osbourne was “shamed and bullied” into walking back her comments and called for an apology from the other “The Talk” co-hosts on behalf of himself, citing their “disgraceful slurs against ME.”

‘South Park’ Vaccination Special Is Cable’s Top 2021 Show Among Young Adults (Exclusive)
========================================================================================

“Vaccination Special” is show’s second-highest rated episode since 2017

[Tim Baysinger](https://www.thewrap.com/author/tim-b/ "Posts by Tim Baysinger") | March 12, 2021 @ 1:31 PM

![Image 33: The South Park children are seen wearing Lil' Q-ties t-shirts, with a big South Park Elementary sign behind them](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/south-park-2.jpg)
Comedy Central

The second “South Park” pandemic special didn’t fare quite as well as last year’s, but it still managed to notch cable’s top rating among young adults in 2021.

The hour-long “Vaccination Special” drew a 1.37 rating among adults 18-34 and averaged 1.74 million viewers, according to Nielsen’s live-plus-same-day measurement. Both of those figures were down from the “Pandemic Special” that aired last September, which hit a [seven-year ratings high](https://www.thewrap.com/south-park-pandemic-special-notches-7-year-ratings-high/) for the longrunning animated series.

Wednesday’s episode, which is currently available to stream on HBO Max, was still “South Park’s” second best performance since 2017.

The episode was simulcast on far fewer ViacomCBS networks compared to last year’s “Pandemic Special,” which was carried on MTV, VH1, CMT, Paramount Network, TV Land and Pop TV. Wednesday’s “Vaccination Special” was only simulcast on MTV2. The “Pandemic Special” drew 4.05 million viewers across all its networks, while “Vaccination” averaged a still-impressive 3.47 million viewers.

The “Vaccination Special” featured Mr. Garrison’s return to his old self (now that Donald Trump is out of office) as he helps the town get their COVID-19 vaccination shots. Additionally, the episode spent much of its time poking fun at QAnon conspiracy theories.

Like the previous special, the “Vaccination Special” is not considered part of “South Park’s” upcoming 24th season, which will (hopefully) premiere later this year. The series, from creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, is currently renewed through Season 26.
