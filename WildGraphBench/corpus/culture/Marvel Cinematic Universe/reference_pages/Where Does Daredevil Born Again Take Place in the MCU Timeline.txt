This article contains MAJOR Spoilers for Daredevil: Born Again Episodes 1 & 2[**_Daredevil: Born Again_**](https://movieweb.com/daredevil-born-again/) has finally arrived on Disney+, and the first two episodes feature multiple time jumps that will throw viewers for a loop. Ever since [the events of _Avengers: Endgame_](https://movieweb.com/mcu-jumped-the-shark-avengers-endgame/), the MCU has been operating on a five-year time jump that, for a while, was well ahead of the viewers. This has led to a great deal of confusion among audience members, wondering when each project is supposed to take place, particularly in relationship to one another, since the year a project came out does not always signify the year it takes place as it did during the Infinity Saga. It is undoubtedly made more difficult when one considers that with viewers now in the year 2025, this is the same year that series like _She-Hulk: Attorney at Law_, _Moon Knight_, and _Ms. Marvel_ all happen despite those series airing in 2022.

_Daredevil: Born Again_ certainly complicates things as it is a continuation of the Marvel Netflix series, which had its own long continuity behind it. In addition, Daredevil and The Kingpin have popped up in and out of other MCU titles during the Multiverse Saga before _Daredevil: Born Again_, calling into question how those series relate to this new one. Thankfully, _Daredevil: Born Again_ is filled with plenty of clues about its placement in the MCU timeline, with Episodes 1 and 2 [spanning about three years](https://movieweb.com/daredevil-born-again-is-darker-after-six-year-time-jump-netflix-series/).

The Prologue Takes Place the Same Year as 'She-Hulk: Attorney at Law' and 'Echo'
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**_Daredevil: Born Again_'s first episode features a prologue set one year before the series' main events**. While the exact year is not given, there are some big clues as to when it happened and its relationship to other MCU titles. First, people must know what Matt Murdock and Wilson Fisk have been up to since _Daredevil_ Season 3. The _Daredevil_ final season occurred in 2018, right before Thanos's snap that wiped out half of all life in the universe. However, the **_Echo_ series confirms that Matt Murdock and his arch-rival Wilson Fisk survived the snap, and both were active in 2021 at least**.

Matt Murdock's first MCU appearance since his series was canceled was in _Spider-Man: No Way Home_, where he was Peter Parker's lawyer. While most of that film takes place in the fall/beginning holiday season of 2024, Matt Murdock's time as Peter Parker's lawyer was in the summer of that year. _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ concludes with Peter Parker swinging through New York in December as the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree is up, which means it takes place right before _Hawkeye_, which saw the return of The Kingpin.

_Hawkeye_ takes place in December 2024._Echo_, the spin-off of _Hawkeye_ that follows Maya Lopez, takes place five months later, in May 2025. Matt Murdock's appearance on _She-Hulk: Attorney at Law_ takes place in the summer of 2025; the official Marvel Cinematic Universe timeline reveals that the revived Jennifer Walters / She-Hulk ending where Matt Murdock meets Jennifer Walters's family happens in the fall of 2025. With Wilson Fisk's mayoral campaign confirmed to be happening one year later,**the prologue in****_Daredevil: Born Again_ takes place in the fall of 2025, shortly after _She-Hulk: Attorney at Law_.**

The Series Itself Is Set a Year Later

Disney+

_Daredevil: Born Again_ seemingly confirms this, as it is revealed that following Matt Murdock's showdown with Bullseye that resulted in the death of Foggy Nelson, he quit being Daredevil._She-Hulk: Attorney at Law_ was one of his last active moments as Daredevil within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. **This now puts the main storyline of Episode 1 in 2026.** This also means there is a good chance that before the election takes place, the events of _Agatha All Along_ are happening at the same time since that series takes place in the fall of 2026.

This now means that the _Daredevil: Born Again_ opening prologue takes place seven years after the events of _Daredevil_ Season 3, fitting as it has also been seven years since the show went off the air.

'Daredevil: Born Again' Episode 2 Takes Place at the Same Time as 'Captain America: Brave New World'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The election that Wilson Fisk participated in and won was the 2026 election cycle, and Fisk was named the 112th mayor of New York City. This is also the same election that Thaddeus Ross won the Presidency at the beginning of _Captain America: Brave New World_. That film's opening takes place in November 2026, with the majority of the action taking place in April 2027, as confirmed by the invitation that Sam Wilson, Isaiah Bradley, and Joaquin Torres get to attend the White House. While the real-world New York mayoral elections are held in different four-year cycles, the MCU presidential election is now operating on an alternate timeline of every other four years, like the 2026 election being followed in 2030, as opposed to 2024 and 2028 in our reality.

The Defenders Saga includes seven combined series and 166 episodes of television. That's a lot to sort through, so here is the ultimate watch guide.

**Episode 2 of _Daredevil: Born Again_ starts out on a 2027 New Year's celebration. Meaning the events of _Daredevil: Born Again_ are now happening in the five-month gap between the prologue and the opening action scene of _Captain America: Brave New World_**. This suggests that the events of _Daredevil: Born Again_ will take place in those four months, meaning that the President of the United States in the MCU is still Thaddeus Ross, and he has not [yet become the Red Hulk](https://movieweb.com/captain-america-4-red-hulk-explained/).
