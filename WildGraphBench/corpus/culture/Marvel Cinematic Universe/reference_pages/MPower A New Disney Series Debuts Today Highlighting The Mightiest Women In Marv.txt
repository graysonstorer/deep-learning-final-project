COLLECTED BY

 Organization: [Archive Team](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam)

![Image 4: The image shows an archive team going to rescue your shit, and contains two plastic crates filled with old CD-ROMs, as well as a cabinet of old-fashioned cassette tapes](http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg) Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history. 
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at [archiveteam.org](http://www.archiveteam.org/) and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php), providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

**The Archive Team Panic Downloads** are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

![Image 7: mpower a new disney series debuts today highlighting the mightiest women in marvel 23030803 1](https://web.archive.org/web/20230311110156im_/https://cdn.cgmagonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/mpower-a-new-disney-series-debuts-today-highlighting-the-mightiest-women-in-marvel-23030803-1.jpg)

Today, Disney+ has released a new series called _MPower_, a series based on the comeuppance of the mightiest heroines in the MCU, in a four-episode standalone project.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Disney+ Original series _MPower_, has now gone live for fans of everything Marvel. Each entry functions as a standalone episode that can focus on a powerful character’s inception and history to where they are now, such as Elizabeth Olsen’s portrayal of Wanda Maximoff turned Scarlet Witch, Brie Larson’s [_Captain Marvel_,](https://web.archive.org/web/20230311110156/https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/movie/captain-marvel-review/) and the many powerful women of _[Black Panther: Wakanda Forever](https://web.archive.org/web/20230311110156/https://www.cgmagonline.com/review/movie/black-panther-2-review/)_.

_MPower_ aims to lift the curtain on some of the behind-the-scenes info fans may not have gathered from the films while also revealing the powerful stories behind the actresses and locations. Executive Producer Mark Herzog says, “We’re excited to help illuminate the myriad, powerful stories of women in the MCU,” with “We sincerely hope that the series will empower girls and women all over the world to be their authentic selves in their lives and in their careers” regarding the release. A TV spot has been revealed and can be seen below.

Executive Producer Justin W. Hochberg said, “Every hero has an epic origin story and so does this series,” with “When I conceived ‘MPower,’ I did it out of love for my teen daughter so she would have more icons to look up to, voices to learn from and role models to help her impact the world. Today, that vision is now a reality thanks to Brie Larsen, Elizabeth Olsen, the women of Wakanda and Zoë Saldaña, whose leadership was ‘Mpowering.’”

While the series aims to add depth to the backstories of the powerful women of Marvel, it seems a secondary focus will be to remain faithful to the title and ‘MPower’ women, as Florence Kasumba (Ayo, Black Panther) says, “You could watch it and think ‘people that look like me, we can be Super Heroes too.'”

The entire _MPower_ series can be watched now [on Disney+](https://web.archive.org/web/20230311110156/https://www.disneyplus.com/series/mpower/4NRWwrDEO3Uy).
