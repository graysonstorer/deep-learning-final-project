# Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man: Everything to Know About the Marvel Studios Series

He’s the amazing, spectacular, freshman, _Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man_. In the first Spider-Man animated series from Marvel Studios, a 15-year-old Peter Parker (voiced by Hudson Thames) is getting into the swing of being a superhero just before the events of _Captain America: Civil War_. The Marvel Cinematic Universe-inspired series branches off from the Sacred Timeline into an alternate reality where it’s Oscorp industrialist Norman Osborn (Colman Domingo) — and not Tony Stark — who mentors the Queens-based wall-crawler.

“It follows what you see in _Civil War_,” Brad Winderbaum, Head of Marvel Television and Marvel Animation, previously told [ComicBook](https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/spider-man-freshman-year-animated-series-mcu-cano-multiverse/) about the show first announced as _Spider-Man: Freshman Year_. “Down to Peter getting the broken Blu-ray player from the trash and he walks into his apartment for the famous moment where Tony Stark is waiting for him to offer him the Stark internship and take him to Berlin.”

“Because of things that happen in the multiverse, because of new, random occurrences, it’s not Tony Stark who’s waiting for him there. It’s Norman Osborn,” he continued. “And that sends his life in an unexpected trajectory that collides him with [many unexpected characters in the Marvel Universe](https://comicbook.com/tv-shows/news/your-friendly-neighborhood-spider-man-marvel-characters-explained-guide/).” (More on them below.)

Is Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man In the MCU?
----------------------------------------------------

The series is MCU-adjacent: it takes place in a timeline that splinters from the live-action films starring Tom Holland as Spider-Man. Peter and Nico are meant to attend Midtown High School of Science and Technology, but they end up at Bales High — which means no Michelle “MJ” Jones, Ned Leeds, Liz Allan, or Flash Thompson.

Peter interns at Oscorp, so the Stark internship never happens, and Spider-Man isn’t present during the Avengers’ battle at a German airport in _Captain America: Civil War_.

“We have the privilege of following the movies and shows, so we pay homage to them as well as the comics,” said head writer and executive producer Jeff Trammell (_Craig of the Creek_). “We build on things we’ve seen before but present them in new ways. We use those expectations to our advantage and turn things away from where you might expect. I’m excited for people to see new twists on classic characters, and I’m also excited to introduce characters that aren’t normally featured in Spider-Man stories.”

Trammell continued, “You’re going to see some familiar faces — and if you’re a fan of Chameleon, you’re going to see a few of _his_ faces. You’re also going to see Scorpion, as well as a few characters who may _seem_ new, like Speed Demon or Butane. We have a huge rogues gallery to play with, and so we’re looking forward to putting some of them in the forefront.”
