[Harrison Ford](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/harrison-ford/) is joining the [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/marvel-cinematic-universe/), taking on the role of General Ross, previously played by the late actor Williams Hurt, sources confirm to _The Hollywood Reporter_.

Ford will appear as Ross in _Captain America_: _New World Order_, which will star Anthony Mackie reprising his longtime Marvel character of Sam Wilson. _The Cloverfield Paradox_ helmer Julius Onah is set to direct. The movie will take place after the events of 2021’s Marvel Disney+ series _The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_, which saw Wilson finally accept the shield and mantle of Captain America.

A part from _Captain America 4,_ Ford would also play Ross in _Thunderbolts_ about the team of supervillains, which is set to be directed by Jake Schreier. The news was [first reported](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=235&v=xLfPDneKWAQ&feature=emb_logo) by the podcast _The Hot Mic With Jeff Sneider and John Rocha_.

Hurt appeared as Ross in 2008’s _Incredible Hulk_ and returned for 2016’s _Captain America: Civil War_ and subsequent Marvel movies. (Prior to this, Sam Elliot played the part in 2003’s _Hulk_.) Hurt, whose credits included _Broadcast News_ and _Body Heat_, [died earlier this year](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/william-hurt-dead-body-heat-broadcast-news-1235110394/). He was 71.

While this will be Ford’s first foray into the MCU, the actor is no strange to franchise filmmaking, leading both _Star Wars_ and _Indiana Jones_ films for decades. Ford is set to reprise his role at the intrepid archeologist, his last outing in the role, for[_Indiana Jones 5_](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/indiana-jones-5-footage-arrives-d23-1235213359/)due out June 30, 2023.
