Robert Downey Jr., Paul Bettany and other cast and crew of Marvel's Captain America: Civil War give us the lowdown on the making of the film.

Members of Team Cap, Team Iron Man and every Marvel-lover in between descended upon Hollywood Tuesday night for the world premiere of _Captain America: Civil War_(which is in theaters May 5).**Here are five things we learned on the blue-and-red carpet about the superhero film:**

1. The fight sequences really step it up.
-----------------------------------------

"From _The Winter Soldier_, [directors] the Russo Brothers wanted to amp it up a notch," said stunt coordinator Sam Hargrave. "We were tasked with giving each character a new fighting style ... and we tried to mix that with the same hard-hitting action as second film, and I think we outdid ourselves," especially during a "fight in the stairwell. Look for it," he said.

2. One important device saved the Vision from losing his mind.
--------------------------------------------------------------

Actor Paul Bettany had to wear plenty of uncomfortable makeup as his metallic red-colored character, Vision. How does he make it through long shoots?"I have to wear a cooling suit underneath the suit that's like a radiator that pumps freezing-cold water so I don't lose my mind and rip off the makeup," he said. "It's a lovely feeling if you're in 110-degree Atlanta heat. It's suddenly like being in a gin and tonic, which is a very nice place to be."

3. Daniel Brühl was wowed by Marvel movie magic.
------------------------------------------------

Brühl, who makes his Marvel Cinematic Universe debut in _Civil War_, said he was overwhelmed by _Civil War_ set _._"It's all bigger," he said."When I was on set in Atlanta, I became a 12-year-old boy." He also became very overheated. While shooting a scene meant to look"somewhere faraway in a very cold place," the set was actually very warm and Bruhl had to wear a Canada Goose jacket.

4. Robert Downey Jr. has one word for why Captain America and Iron Man can't get along.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To put it simply: "Politics," said Downey. The two friends are at odds in the appropriately-titled _Civil War._

5. Spider-Man's introduction in the movie will make you laugh. And clap.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first time Spider-Man, played by Tom Holland,works with members of the Avengers on the big screen. According to executive producer Nate Moore, "Tom Holland's introduction scene is so funny and so fun," he said."Peter Parker doesn't live by himself, so we get to meet another new face in the Marvel Universe: Aunt May, Marisa Tomei." When the premiere screening audience got their first glimpse of Spidey, they laughed, as expected. They also applauded.
