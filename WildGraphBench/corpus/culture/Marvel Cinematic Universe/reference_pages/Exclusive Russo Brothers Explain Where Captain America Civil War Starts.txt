_Captain America: Civil War_ directors Anthony & Joe Russo are set to appear at[Wizard World New Orleans](http://www.wizardworld.com/home-neworleans.html) this weekend. In advance of their Comic Con appearance, the Russo Brothers joined[ComicBook.com](http://comicbook.com/) for an exclusive interview.

We asked the Russo Brothers exactly where do we find Captain America at the start of _Civil War_ and how much time has passed since _Avengers: Age of Ultron_.

"We like to say that the amount of time that has passed in between films is the amount of time that has passed in the movies," answered Joe Russo. "So, it's about that amount time. We find Cap leading the Avengers. He's tutoring or mentoring Scarlet Witch in the beginning of the movie and bringing her into the fold. We find them on a mission at the start of the film. The effect that Ultron has had on everyone certainly is central to the storytelling of the movie. It's very strong. We're dealing with issues of collateral damage, imperialism, what rights do super heroes have to pursue villains across borders. It's very politically minded. Cap's dealing with all of that at the beginning."

Keep checking back to[Comicbook.com](http://comicbook.com/) as we will have more from our exclusive interview with the Russo Brothers later today. And if you're going to be in the New Orleans area, be sure to stop by and meet them in person at [Wizard World Comic Con](http://www.wizardworld.com/home-neworleans.html).

Captain America: Civil War is scheduled to be released in movie theaters on [May 6, 2016](http://comicbook.com/list/franchise-movies-release-schedule).

There's some beefy info in this interview. Seems like the film has a serious tone, which is good imo.
