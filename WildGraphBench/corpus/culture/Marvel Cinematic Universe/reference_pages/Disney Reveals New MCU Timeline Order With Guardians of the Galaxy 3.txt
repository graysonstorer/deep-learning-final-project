# Disney+ Reveals New MCU Timeline Order With Guardians of the Galaxy 3

After [_Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3_](https://thedirect.com/tags/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3/)'s [Disney+](https://thedirect.com/tags/disney-plus/) debut, its exact place on the [MCU](https://thedirect.com/MCU/) timeline was revealed.

Following its May 5 theatrical release, _Guardians 3_, starring [Chris Pratt](https://thedirect.com/tags/chris-pratt/), Zoe Zaldana, [Dave Bautista](https://thedirect.com/tags/dave-bautista/), and [Bradley Cooper](https://thedirect.com/tags/bradley-cooper/), hit [Disney](https://thedirect.com/tags/disney/)+ on Wednesday, August 2.

During its theatrical run, _Vol. 3_ earned $845.3 million at the worldwide [box office](https://thedirect.com/tags/box-office/), currently the second-highest of 2023 but soon to be passed by the [_Barbie_ sensation](https://thedirect.com/article/barbie-movie-box-office-record).

When Does Guardians of the Galaxy 3 Take Place?
-----------------------------------------------

According to Disney+, _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3_ takes place after _Ant-Man and The Wasp: Quantumania_ and before _Secret Invasion_, in the order in which they were released this year.

Originally slated to be released in 2020, it's interesting to think about when _Vol. 3_ would've been on the timeline had [James Gunn](https://thedirect.com/tags/james-gunn/) never been fired from Disney.

Nevertheless, the current timeline placement shouldn't come as much of a shock. Whether it takes place before or after _Ant-Man 3_ seems irrelevant, but _Vol. 3_ was certain to fall after the event of _The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special_.

The Guardians of the Galaxy's Complicated Timeline History
----------------------------------------------------------

The 10th MCU film,_Guardians of the Galaxy_ was a surprise hit in August 2014. It was a space adventure that brought the superhero fun of the MCU, mixed with James Gunn's unique spin and a hint of galactic adventures like _Star Wars_.

While many other films in Phase 2 and Phase 3 pushed the MCU narrative forward (_Avengers: Age of Ultron_, _Captain America: Civil War_, [_Doctor Strange_](https://thedirect.com/tags/doctor-strange-movie/), etc), _Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_ was stuck in the past.

_Vol. 2_ was released in May 2017 but was set soon after the event of its predecessor, which is set in 2014 within the MCU.

The Guardians story didn't catch up to the rest of the cinematic universe until _Avengers: Infinity War_ when everything building within the [Infinity Saga](https://thedirect.com/tags/infinity-saga/) reached a breaking point.

After appearing in _Thor: Love and Thunder_, _Guardians 3_ was the first film of its series to take place in the present-day MCU in nearly a decade.

_Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3_ is now streaming on Disney+.
