# All the big Deadpool & Wolverine cameos

**Warning: This article contains spoilers from _Deadpool & Wolverine_.**

It may seem that just about everyone has been "rumored" to appear in [_Deadpool & Wolverine_](https://ew.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-8672901). As director [Shawn Levy](https://ew.com/person/shawn-levy/) once [joked](https://ew.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-shawn-levy-ryan-reynolds-hugh-jackman-reunion-goosebumps-8630797) with _Entertainment Weekly_, "I haven't read any [Tom Cruise](https://ew.com/person/tom-cruise/) rumors. And who knows? Maybe that's just the internet asleep at the wheel."

The speculation ran the gamut from original X-Men movie characters like [James Marsden](https://ew.com/person/james-marsden/) (Cyclops) and [Famke Janssen](https://ew.com/person/famke-janssen/) (Jean Grey) to superstar [Taylor Swift](https://ew.com/person/taylor-swift/) (which [EW debunked](https://ew.com/taylor-swift-not-in-deadpool-and-wolverine-exclusive-8661033)). And because of the magic of the multiverse, it all seemed possible.

Stars [Ryan Reynolds](https://ew.com/person/ryan-reynolds/) and [Hugh Jackman](https://ew.com/person/hugh-jackman/), as well as Levy, purposefully didn't comment on any of them, allowing the constantly churning rumor mill to become free publicity, drumming up more and more buzz the longer it went. But now, with TikTokers publishing videos of the movie screen straight from theaters on opening weekend, it's hard to keep the secrets hidden anymore. Plus, a bunch of the surprise cameos made their way to [Comic-Con](https://ew.com/events/comic-con/) in San Diego. So... yeah.

Here are all the big _Deadpool & Wolverine_ cameos to set the record straight.

**Previously seen in:** Various films across the MCU

Head of Security for Stark Industries, [Jon Favreau](https://ew.com/person/jon-favreau/)'s Happy Hogan makes a return in _Deadpool & Wolverine_ to interview Wade Wilson, who wants to join the Avengers and make something of his life. It does not go well for Wade, and the jokes about Happy's former role as a personal driver probably didn't help his case.

Chris Hemsworth as Thor

**Previously seen in:** Various films across the MCU

[Chris Hemsworth](https://ew.com/person/chris-hemsworth/)'s Asgardian God of Thunder makes a very brief appearance on a television screen inside Time Variance Authority headquarters. Mr. Paradox ([Matthew Macfadyen](https://ew.com/person/matthew-macfadyen/)) shows Wade snapshots of what his life could look like if he left his reality and joined the Sacred Timeline. On one such screen, Wade sees a glimpse of a future in which he's dying in the arms of a crying Thor.

Henry Cavill as a Wolverine variant

**Previously seen in:** Online listicles

[Henry Cavill](https://ew.com/person/henry-cavill/) is one of the many actors Marvel fans dream cast to play the role of Logan/Wolverine on screen after Jackman, and that dream becomes a reality for a brief moment in _Deadpool & Wolverine_. Wade steals TVA tech and travels to different realities in search of an alternate Wolverine. This leads him to meet different variations of the adamantium-clawed mutant, one of which is dubbed in the end credits as "Cavillrine," a.k.a. Cavill as Wolverine. There's even a gag alluding to how the actor has been working down the street at DC as Superman.

Hulk (but no Mark Ruffalo)

**Previously seen in:** Various MCU projects

Hulk technically makes an appearance in Deadpool & Wolverine, but we don't see his face and only hear his hulked-out screech as he pummels Deadpool. The merc travels to another reality to meet one of many Wolverine variants, and he finds one wearing the classic comic book-style brown-and-yellow suit. Wade mentions this is the garb Logan wore when he fought Hulk, who then appears to give a smackdown on Wade.

05 of 17

Chris Evans as Johnny Storm

**Previously seen in:**_Fantastic Four_ (2005), _Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer_ (2007)

[Chris Evans](https://ew.com/person/chris-evans/) certainly left a lasting legacy on the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Captain America, but through an ingenious turn, he instead pops up in _Deadpool & Wolverine_ as his _other_ famous Marvel role. Mr. Paradox sends both Wade and Logan to the "trash heap," a.k.a. the Void, the location introduced in Disney+ series _Loki,_ and the place things go before they are deleted forever. That's where they meet Johnny Storm/Human Torch, the hero Evans played in 2005's _Fantastic Four_ and 2007's _Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer_, opposite Ioan Gruffudd as Reed Richards/Mr. Fantastic, Jessica Alba as Sue Storm/Invisible Woman, and Michael Chiklis as Ben Grimm/the Thing.

Aaron Stanford as Pyro

[Aaron Stanford](https://ew.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-aaron-stanford-pyro-return-18-years-later-exclusive-8673910) first made his debut as the mutant with command over fire as a student at Professor Charles Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters in _X2_. Once close friends with Bobby Drake (Shawn Ashmore) and Rogue (Anna Paquin), he switched sides and joined Magneto (Ian McKellen) in the Brotherhood of Mutants. He pops up in _Deadpool & Wolverine_ as one of the many mutants sent to the Void by the TVA and forced to serve Cassandra Nova ([Emma Corrin](https://ew.com/person/emma-corrin/)).

Sabretooth, as played by Tyler Mane, is Wolverine's most famous foe from Marvel Comics. With animalistic abilities, including cat-like reflexes, retractable claws, fangs, and accelerated healing, he served as the chief muscleman for Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants. Sabretooth was last seen getting blasted out of the top of the Statue of Liberty by Cyclops. In _Deadpool & Wolverine_, he serves Cassandra and faces off with Logan once again in the wasteland of the Void.

Various X-Men baddies

Many other mutants serve Cassandra in the Void but are not played by X-Men movie veterans. They really only exist either in the background or amidst a major fight sequence that plays out. Some of the key cameos include Toad (2000's _X-Men_), the teleporting Azazel (2011's _X-Men: First Class_), the near-indestructible Juggernaut (2006's _X-Men: The Last Stand_, 2018's _Deadpool 2_), Lady Deathstrike (2003's _X2_), Callisto (2006's _X-Men: The Last Stand_), Psylocke (2016's _X-Men: Apocalypse_), and Quill (_X-Men: The Last Stand_). There's also a non-X-Men background character: Bullseye from 2003's _Daredevil_.

Jennifer Garner as Elektra

**Previously seen in:**_Daredevil_ (2003), _Elektra_ (2005)

Aside from the X-Men and Fantastic Four, there are few other past Marvel characters lost to time. One of them is [Jennifer Garner](https://ew.com/person/jennifer-garner/)'s Elektra era. The star of classic rom-coms like _13 Going on 30_ and _Ghosts of Girlfriends Past_ first arrived as the trained assassin with twin sai daggers in 2003's _Daredevil_, which starred [Ben Affleck](https://ew.com/person/ben-affleck/) as the Devil of Hell's Kitchen. She then went on to headline her own Elektra movie that dealt with the character's history with the order of ninjas known as the Hand. [_The Hollywood Reporter_](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/deadpool-3-jennifer-garner-returning-as-elektra-1235530539/) first confirmed Garner's surprise Elektra return years later in _Deadpool & Wolverine_, and she does so as part of the Resistance, a small group in the Void fighting against Cassandra and looking for their way out. Garner recently appeared in _The Adam Project_ (2022), which starred Reynolds and was directed by Levy.

Wesley Snipes as Blade

Some motherf---ers are always trying to ice skate uphill. Not this motherf---er. Joining Garner's Elektra as another member of the Resistance is [Wesley Snipes](https://ew.com/person/wesley-snipes/)' Blade. The actor reprises the role for the first time in 20 years. It also makes for a fun connection to Reynolds, who costarred in _Blade: Trinity_, the third of Snipes' original _Blade_ trilogy, as vampire hunter Hannibal King.

Channing Tatum as Gambit

**Previously seen in:** Channing Tatum's dreams

Once upon a time, in the ol' days when 20th Century Fox was a studio that owned the rights to the X-Men, [Channing Tatum](https://ew.com/person/channing-tatum/) was [set to star as Gambit](https://ew.com/article/2014/10/31/channing-tatum-gambit/) in a standalone movie about the Cajun card slinger. Those plans were scrapped, and [the project never came to fruition](https://ew.com/movies/channing-tatum-says-gambit-would-have-been-rom-com-superhero-movie/), but _Deadpool & Wolverine_ offers a glimpse into what could've been. Tatum debuts in a comic book-accurate Gambit look as the third member of the Resistance in the Void.

[Dafne Keen](https://ew.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-dafne-keen-laura-x-23-first-look-hugh-jackman-reunion-exclusive-8680283) filmed her role of Laura, a.k.a. X-23, for the movie _Logan_ when she was 11. Now, she returns at 19 to play the character again. Laura is technically Wolverine's daughter with similar abilities and an adamantium skeleton since she was engineered with the mutant's DNA. We last saw Laura standing over the gravesite of Wolverine, who became a surrogate father to her. She's the fourth and last member of the Resistance in the Void.

The Deadpool Corps., a gang comprised entirely of alternate reality variants of Deadpool, arrive in _Deadpool & Wolverine_. Among them is Lady Deadpool. Speculation around this casting ran rampant online, with some convinced it would be Taylor Swift. Nope. It's actually one of Swift's besties. While the character never takes off her mask, the end credits confirm she's voiced by [Blake Lively](https://ew.com/person/blake-lively/), Reynolds' wife.

Matthew McConaughey as Cowboy Deadpool

[Matthew McConaughey](https://ew.com/person/matthew-mcconaughey/) has entered the MCU, and that is alright, alright, alright. The native Texan, who literally graced the cover of [_Southern Living_](https://www.southernliving.com/matthew-and-camila-mcconaughey-8548472) to confirm just how much he loves his home state, voices the character of Cowboy Deadpool, a.k.a. the Deadpool Kid, another Deadpool variant in the Deadpool Corps.

Inez Reynolds as Kidpool
------------------------

Kidpool of Marvel Comics.

We already got Kid Loki in the MCU, played by Jack Veal. Now it's time for Kidpool. In the comics, Kidpool is self-explanatory: he's a kid version of Deadpool. In _Deadpool & Wolverine_, the character is another member of the Deadpool Corps. and is voiced by Inez Reynolds, Reynolds and Lively's 7-year-old daughter.

Nathan Fillion as Headpool
--------------------------

Headpool of Marvel Comics.

Perhaps the strangest member of the Deadpool Corps. is Headpool, a.k.a. the Merc with Half a Mouth. He hails from the Marvel zombies realm of the multiverse and appears in _Deadpool & Wolverine_ as a floating CGI undead head voiced by [Nathan Fillion](https://ew.com/person/nathan-fillion/).
