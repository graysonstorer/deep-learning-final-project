_The Fantastic Four: First Steps_ has landed on Disney+ and if you missed it at the cinema, you might just be wondering how it fits into the wider MCU. The movie takes place in a separate universe (Earth-828) than the 'main' MCU (Earth-616), which makes it tricky to exactly place in the timeline.

It hasn't been specified the exact year that _[The Fantastic Four](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a65448440/fantastic-four-first-steps-review/)_ takes place, but we've long been told [it's in the 1960s](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a61435370/fantastic-four-fan-theory-confirmed/). Technically, that puts it between _Agent Carter_ and _Captain Marvel_ as one of the earliest MCU outings, but we know that the team will cross over into the 'main' timeline in _Avengers: Doomsday_.

We've already seen a hint of their crossover in the [_Thunderbolts*_ post-credit scene](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a64606432/thunderbolts-credit-scenes-explained-how-many/) which took place 14 months after the events of the movie, so it's cleanest to just watch after _Thunderbolts*_. If _[Avengers:](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a25845422/avengers-5-release-date-cast-title-endgame-sequel/)_ _[Doomsday](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a25845422/avengers-5-release-date-cast-title-endgame-sequel/)_ specifies a particular time jump, then we can adjust the timeline to reflect that, but since _The Fantastic Four_ is standalone, there's no issue wherever you decide to watch it.

If it leaves you hankering for a rewatch of the entire MCU as well, we're here to help with the definitive guide of how to watch the entire MCU in order, including movies, TV shows, TV specials and One-Shot shorts.

(While we've got you, were you looking for [_Star Wars_' timeline](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a825727/star-wars-timeline-chronology/)? We've got that covered. [_X-Men_'s movie order](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a844881/x-men-chronological-order-timeline/)? Help yourself. What about [DC Comics movies' chronological order](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a25604201/dceu-timeline-worlds-of-dc-movies-in-order/)? Easy peasy. All the [Spider-Man movies](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a39583017/sony-spider-man-universe-timeline-venom-morbius/)? We've got them all caught up in a web.)

(Oh, and if you're wondering why we haven't included [_Venom: Let There Be Carnage_](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a37767981/venom-let-there-be-carnage-review/) and [_Morbius_](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a39476343/morbius-review-jared-leto/) it's because even though their credit scenes feature MCU crossovers, the movies themselves aren't MCU movies.)

What is the correct order of the MCU?
-------------------------------------

Before you start on your MCU rewatch, you might be wondering if there's a 'correct order' to watch every movie and TV show released to date.

In short, there's not really a correct order and it's kind of up to you to decide the best way to tackle the MCU.

There are a couple of main ways to approach an MCU rewatch though if you want to have some sense of order.

You can either watch everything in the order they were released, or you can watch everything in chronological order which will require some jumping around the various [Marvel Phases](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a871567/marvel-phase-4-3-2-1-mcu/).

If you are going to undertake an epic rewatch, you can watch almost every MCU movie and TV show on [Disney+](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X991730&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fen-gb%2Fhome) right now. The only exception right now is the _Spider-Man_ trilogy.

How to watch MCU in release order
---------------------------------

If you want the easiest way to watch the entire MCU to date, then stick with the release order – although there are obviously still a lot of movies and TV shows to get through with this method.

You could slim down this list by not watching _Agents of SHIELD_ or the [Netflix](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/g44990474/best-netflix-movies/) shows as even though they are part of the MCU with recurring characters, it's now official that they're not part of the [Sacred Timeline of the MCU](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a45640277/marvel-timeline-mcu/). Instead, they take place in other timelines, but they're still canon.

(Yes, we know that the likes of Charlie Cox and Vincent D'Onofrio returned as [Daredevil](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a46657881/daredevil-born-again-first-look-costume/) and [Kingpin](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a40859991/marvel-echo-first-look-kingpin-return/) in _She-Hulk_ and _Hawkeye_, respectively, and are now officially back in their own show, but just don't think about it too much.)

[Watch the MCU on Disney+](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X991730&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fen-gb%2Fhome)

This all changed on the TV side from Phase 4 onwards as any show after _WandaVision_ was very much part of the MCU, sometimes critical even to understanding what happened in the movies they were connected to.

In the following list, movies are in **bold type**, shorts are in _italics_ and TV shows and one-off specials are neither.

(We've left _X-Men '97_ and _Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man_ off this list as they're not part of the main MCU timeline.)

MCU timeline: How to watch the MCU in chronological order
---------------------------------------------------------

This is the ultimate watch order for MCU completists to watch events of the MCU play out in chronological order, but there are some rules we've had to impose to make it as straightforward as possible.

If something takes place in multiple time periods, such as _[Eternals](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a38120529/eternals-2-release-date/)_, we've put it where the bulk of the movie or TV show takes place.

Chronologically speaking,_Thunderbolts*_ is the latest outing in the MCU, taking place in mid-to-late 2027. We've put _The Fantastic Four: First Steps_ after it for now as it's in a separate universe and might not make sense to watch early on in your MCU watch.

_Deadpool & Wolverine_ technically takes place before the majority of Phase 4 in March 2024, but given that the movie features gags about the Multiverse, it probably makes sense to watch it after everything else even if there's no real connection to wider MCU events.

We'd also suggest watching both seasons of _Loki_ after _Avengers: Endgame_, not only because that's when 2012's Loki [breaks off into his own timeline](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a36660458/loki-episode-1-avengers-endgame-plothole/), but also because the events of the second season establish how the multiverse was created which is a major part of Phase 4 onwards.

[Sign up to Disney+ to watch the entire MCU](https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=127X991730&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fen-gb%2Fhome)

As mentioned above, _[What If...?](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a42442938/what-if-season-2-release-date/)_ also exists in its own space and could technically be watched any time given that it involves multiple universes and timelines.

We've popped all three seasons of the show next to each other on the chronological order, but you could really watch any of the episodes at any time during your marathon MCU watch. Same goes for _Marvel Zombies_, which takes place five years after the 'What If... Zombies?!' episode in _What If...?_'s first season.

We'd suggest watching _What If...?_ after _Loki_ though, as that's the show that introduces the multiverse to the MCU.

And don't even get us started on _[Agents of SHIELD](https://www.digitalspy.com/agents-of-shield/)_'s final season, which mostly took place in an alternate timeline before eventually merging back with the main MCU timeline. For the sake of ease, watch it all after season six, and it'll make as much sense.

_X-Men '97_ and _Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man_ are even more separate to the main timeline than _What If...?_, so we've left them off the chronological order timeline.

But aside from that, it's generally pretty straightforward even when the multiverse comes into play.

As with the release order list, movies are in **bold type**, shorts are in _italics_ and TV shows and one-off specials are neither.
