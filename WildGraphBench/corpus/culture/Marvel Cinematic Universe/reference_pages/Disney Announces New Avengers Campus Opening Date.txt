COLLECTED BY

 Organization: [Archive Team](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam)

![Image 2: The image shows an archive team going to rescue your shit, and contains two plastic crates filled with old CD-ROMs, as well as a cabinet of old-fashioned cassette tapes](http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg) Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history. 
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at [archiveteam.org](http://www.archiveteam.org/) and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php), providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

**The Archive Team Panic Downloads** are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

Disney is bringing [Avengers Campus](https://web.archive.org/web/20211120153316/https://comicbook.com/category/avengers-campus/) to [another one of their theme parks](https://web.archive.org/web/20211120153316/https://comicbook.com/marvel/2020/03/09/avengers-campus-canon-marvel-cinematic-universe-multiverse-avengers-endgame/). During a [Disney Parks](https://web.archive.org/web/20211120153316/https://comicbook.com/category/disney-parks/) presentation, they announced that Disneyland Paris will be welcoming the MCU in the summer of 2022. [Fans of the theme parks](https://web.archive.org/web/20211120153316/https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/avengers-campus-guide-food-web-slingers-ride-stores-tips-california-adventure/)have known that the Avengers Campus would be making its way to other locations since the first one was announced for the California location. Each one of these campuses will have slight variations and storytelling opportunities. People who couldn't spring for a ticket to one of the United States parks have to be thrilled to hear that they won't have to undertake the massive vacation to enjoy meeting their favorite heroes. It will be interesting to see what heroes are there for the initial launch and how they deploy the new characters as they premiere in the movies.

Comicbook.com had the chance to attend an exclusive event when the Disneyland Avengers Campus was revealed to the public. A lot of people were [wondering if these heroes inhabit](https://web.archive.org/web/20211120153316/https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/avengers-campus-marvel-cinematic-universe-timeline/)the same universe as the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

> JUST ANNOUNCED: [#AvengersCampus](https://web.archive.org/web/20211120153316/https://twitter.com/hashtag/AvengersCampus?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) will welcome guests at [@DisneylandParis](https://web.archive.org/web/20211120153316/https://twitter.com/DisneylandParis?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) in summer 2022!

"Absolutely. So first of all, you know, the, the mission to inspire and empower the next generation of heroes is so important, that we've assembled heroes from across all of space and time for that, for that mission. And it is, we're all about to discover in a couple of weeks when Loki comes out, time is a lot more squishy than any of us think," Walt Disney Imagineer Walt Strong explained. "And so trying to put a specific date to it, it can be challenging, but to us, Avengers Campus is here and now, right, we get to live in the moment and these heroes are here with us and you're taking part in that story."

Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige also had some words about what the next step in the company's approach to storytelling looks like. You can see these live-action experiences in other arenas too with the Disney Cruise Lines.

"Going to Disneyland, that's what we did as a family, going on these amazing rides that promised a spectacular future ahead," Feige explained during a behind-the-scenes featurette screened during the media preview. "The notion of having films that I was a part of brought to life is amazing… Avengers Campus is absolutely the next progression of telling these stories, of experiencing what it's like to ride alongside these characters. It could only be done in a Disney theme park attraction."
