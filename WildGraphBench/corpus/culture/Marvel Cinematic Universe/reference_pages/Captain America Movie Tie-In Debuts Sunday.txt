**UPDATE 2/7/11: READ THE FIRST ISSUE OF CAPTAIN AMERICA: FIRST VENGEANCE FOR FREE AT [CAPTAINAMERICA.MARVEL.COM](http://captainamerica.marvel.com/)!**

By Marc Strom

Just as you’re getting your [first look at "Captain America: The First Avenger" during this Sunday’s Super Bowl XLV](http://marvel.com/news/story/15048/thor_and_cap_super_bowl_bound), you can also go further into the story with CAPTAIN AMERICA: FIRST VENGEANCE, an eight issue digital comics series debuting Sunday, February 6 with the complete first issue available for free at captainamerica.com! The issue will then be available on the Marvel Comics iPad/iPhone/iPod Touch app starting Tuesday, February 8.

Written by Fred Van Lente and drawn alternately by Luke Ross and Neil Edwards--along with some gorgeous colors by Richard Isanove--FIRST VENGEANCE weaves in and out of the story of Cap's upcoming film, introducing readers to new corners of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

"When we started launching Marvel Studios and decided these movies were interconnected, we established that it’s going to be a separate movie continuity that, while it exists parallel to the comics and allows us to pick the best moments from all the previous continuities, it needs to be beholden unto itself," explains Stephen Broussard, Co-Producer of "Captain America: The First Avenger." Once we established the premise that we did want to do that and we wanted to make sure it made sense as a cohesive, whole piece, it really sort of freed us up to start asking what other stories would we like to tell. And of course there’s no shortage of interesting ideas for all that. Basically anything that we really loved but didn't necessarily have a place in the film is fair game."

The story of FIRST VENGEANCE will cover quite a bit of territory, according to Broussard.

"It doesn’t really cover one particular place," he elaborates. "There's a little bit of backstory, there's a little bit of parallel action going on to the movie, and there's a little bit of hints of things to come. But it's all sort of jumbled up in this really satisfying way where you feel like you're getting to walk around the whole piece and see the story from the different angles. That's what's really most interestig about this, it's an opportunity to dig deeper into things that are exciting about the movie that you want to know about, or that are only hinted at between the lines in the movie. It's an opportunity to really bring that all to the surface."

While fans have yet to meet the Steve Rogers of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, they’ve known his comic counterpart for 70 years now, and Broussard hopes that FIRST VENGEANCE will give viewers a deeper relationship to the filmic Captain America.

"For a lot of people, they"ve lived with Steve Rogers for decades, so they really do feel like they know him already," the producer continues. "So it’s just another opportunity to continue fleshing him out in the Marvel Cinematic Universe the way he has been in the standard comics universe for years."

Creating a film comes with certain necessary restraints--namely, the set amount of time you have to tell your story in. So while "Captain America: The First Avenger" will stand on its own, FIRST VENGEANCE allows the creators to delve into story beats that couldn't make it onto the screen.

"There are lots of little side stories along the way that would be fascinating if we could stop and listen to them, but just really don't fit into the structure of the story we’re telling," offers Broussard. "What this does, is it allows us to do that. We hear talk about Steve's parents in the film. What was his relationship like with them? That’s something we explore in the first issue. We know that Steve and Bucky have been best friends for a long time, but what was it like when they first met? How did their relationship grow and deepen through the years? All of which is fascinating territory to cover, and it’s great to have an outlet that lets us do all that."

Fred Van Lente, a veteran writer of the traditional Marvel Universe, will dip his toes into the Marvel Cinematic Universe with this latest outing, and the writer hopes that fans will enjoy touring this corner of the newly-formed universe.

[Captain America: First Vengeance #1 preview art by Luke Ross](https://marvel.com/images/gallery/story/15104/captain_america_movie_tie-in_debuts_super_bowl_sunday/image/856119)

"The relationship between Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, for example, is very different, and in a very cool way," says the writer, explaining the differences. "And what's neat about the Marvel Cinematic Universe, just like in the comics' universe, is the interconnections between various movies, particularly 'Iron Man 2' and 'Thor.' You'll start to see those coming out in FIRST VENGEANCE."

While working on the series, Van Lente had a lot of input from those directly responsible for steering "Captain America: The First Avenger" and the larger Marvel Cinematic Universe.

"Marvel Chief Creative Officer Joe Quesada and producer Stephen Broussard have been looking over each one of my scripts, keeping me locked in with the vision of the film, and it's been hugely rewarding," Van Lente comments. "Given the way we're launching this comic, out of a Super Bowl spot, it has a chance to really expand the visibility of the comics medium so everyone, from Joe and Stephen on down to me and the artists, are really trying to give people an exciting reading experience they'll never forget--that will both be great unto itself and also enhance their viewing of the film when they go and see it."

Having worked in the world of the film for a while now, Van Lente still can't help but get excited at the prospect of seeing the finished movie when it hits theaters on July 22.

"I read the script last fall and just thought it was terrific. Now, as we're working on the art for the book, having seen all the stills and tech and costumes, it's really got me jazzed. I think this really will go down as one of the classic super hero films."

i agree they train wrecked doctor doom they used none of his origonal back story and the galactus would have made a better movie to bring the movies together. my biggest pet peive is that they gave cap a pistol the original cap never had a gun he had the shield thats it. and when cap died the second guy used the sheild and no gun the guy died to the gun doesnt show until the third captain america

First of all, just because you don't like Push it doesn't mean that Evans, Honsou or Fanning didn't put in good performances.More to the point Evans is considered a good actor by those in the industry, such as Oscar winner Danny Boyle; try watching Sunshine if you're still under the impression that he isn't a capable actor.

He might do good. i'm more confused about the suit, i thought it was a lot shinier in the comics. Maybe they will give him a new wardrobe when the avengers unfreeze him

Did I just read someone post that Chris Evans is a serious actor? LMAO based on what? His work in that crap Push? Or maybe that award winning performance in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World? Oh wait that hard hitting performance in street kings right?? LMAO Hey he may do great but lets not over hype him.

sorry morf-89, i will not be thinking one time while i am watching captain america that he played the human torch, because after the disgrace that the second FF movie is, I have long forgotten about the FF movies. Chris Evans is going to rock this movie because he is a good actor and when disney gets the rights to FF movies and reboot that garbage im sure they will cast someone else to play the torch.hell-frost, stay up to date with news, toby is no longer spider-man because it is getting rebooted so they can be more true to the comic, like using web shooters and falling for gwen stacy before he ever falls for mary jane. its just a shame that its not done by disney yet, which im sure when they do get the rights they will probably reboot it as well. just like they are going to do to x-men when fox finally loses the rights. if everyone is smart they will boycott this abomination of a movire, x-men first class, because it is goin to be more garbage and more untrue to comic than the other x-men movies put together.i agree with u morty_d83, people should quit trying to knock on how someone is goin to act a part until they see the movie, or at least wait until u all get a glimpse of the movie during the superbowl. i do not know if u r trying to knock on the last hulk movie, but i have to say that it was every bit as good as iron man. too bad they are not going to make another one before the avengers.well, i said what i had to say. for all u haters out there, chill out a little, the iron man and hulk movies proved that they are goin to do this avengers thing right

I think all of you nay-sayers out there need to wait until after the movie to credit it or not. With all these rants on here is exactly why Chris Evans originally turned down the part, twice i believe. He is a serious actor though and as such should not be underestimated. I think the FOUR needs a redo anyways, like the Hulk, X-men, and even Spiderman. It lacked that true Marvelness. Since they are redoing Spiderman and X-men, and they already corrected the Hulk. It seems only fair to correct the list of mistakes in the FOUR and start over. I personaly think he will do great. I have watched every movie that Chris Evans had played in. HE was a victim of typecasting, but in some roles, like in The Perfect Score, he did show, in a teenage wanna bang everything that moves, that he can be a leader. In Cellular he prooved that he could play the part a serious part. He also has the Action thing down. I think most of you are taking into account only a hand full of his performances and deciding based on that. Just my opinion of course, but time will tell who is right. I personally cannot wait. This Summer will totally trump 2008, the Summer of Hulk and Ironman.

I completely agree with Havik86, they did ruin the fantastic four because of Doom, Silver surfer and Galactus. Now im not a big fan of the four but the relationship between silver surfer and galactus is a great story and they used none of it.And i agree with Hell-Frost Chris Evans was such a poor choice not only can I not see him being able to fill caps shoes but all your guna think when watching it is that he's the human torch

Oh yeah, funny, like they will actually make crossover movies in the near future if ever. Avengers obvious doesn't count.First off, it's the Movie Industry. They never give us what we want. When they do make stuff right they wait too long to do a decent sequel. Now they did great with Spider-man except they waited too long n Toby's look changed too much. But they still should have made more.They need to plan ahead n say, okay, lets make these movies one a year before the actor gets too old to play the part.Second, it's Marvel n they never take something that was done right the first time n put it on film. It's gotta be all changed around. That's why X-Men Movies took a nosedive. What a train-wreck.

Fantastic Four isn't going to have another movie until it gets rebooted. Honestly I don't think there's really another movie to be made anyways. They screwed up Dr. Doom. They screwed up Silver Surfer. They screwed up Galactus. But most of all, they just weren't that entertaining. I actually found both movies to be boring.

Why on Earth would you use Chris Evans as Captian America? He is already cast perfectly as the Human Torch, now you will be needing to redo the Fantastic Four to add a new Human Torch so you can do future crossovers and Marvel Team ups.
