No matter how things go for the good guys in the next two _Avengers_ movies, it’s beginning to look like the Marvel Cinematic Universe won’t have Steve Rogers to kick around for much longer. Chris Evans has seemingly confirmed that he will hang up Captain America’s shield after the as-yet-untitled fourth _Avengers_ feature, due out in 2019.

A profile of the actor in the [_The New York Times_](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/theater/chris-evans-lobby-hero-captain-america.html) asserts that Evans will leave the Marvel franchise after planned reshoots for the fourth _Avengers_ movie later this year, quoting him as saying, “You want to get off the train before they push you off.” (Evans has played Captain America since 2011’s _Captain America: The First Avenger_.)

It isn’t the first time the idea of Evans retiring as Captain America has been raised. Initial interviews from the set of next month’s _[Avengers: Infinity War](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/avengers-infinity-war/)_ featured much discussion about the possibility of many of the original Avengers cast retiring, talking about the movie’s promotion being one of the final times they’ll spend together. However, this does appear to be the first confirmation from Evans that he’s planning his departure from the franchise.

In comic book lore, Steve Rogers is but one of a number of Captains America, and two of his comic book replacements are already present in the MCU: Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), and Sam Wilson, the Falcon (Anthony Mackie). Fans have long suspected that Rogers could die as part of _Infinity War_ or its follow-up, leading to another character picking up the mantle — has Evans just added fuel to the fire?

Evans has made Captain America one of the studio’s most beloved characters. He initially had a six-picture deal but extended it to include the fourth _Avengers_ movie. In addition to three _Captain America_ films and four _Avengers_ films, he’s shot small cameos in 2013’s _Thor: The Dark World_ and last year’s _Spider-Man: Homecoming_(not to mention a post-credits tease in 2015’s _Ant-Man_ that wound up in _Captain America: Civil War_). In other words, he’s popped up in a Marvel movie every year since 2011.

_Avengers: Infinity War_ is set for April 27.
