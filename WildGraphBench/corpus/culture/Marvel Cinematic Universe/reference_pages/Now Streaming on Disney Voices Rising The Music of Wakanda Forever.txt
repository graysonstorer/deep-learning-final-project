Oscar®-winning composer Ludwig Göransson and director Ryan Coogler collaborated with musicians and artists from across the globe to craft the score for _**Black Panther: Wakanda Forever**_,one of the most anticipated sequels in modern movie history. **_Voices Rising: The Music of Wakanda Forever_**is a three-episode series showcasing how this extraordinary team pushed the boundaries of what a Hollywood score and soundtrack can be, creating an immersive, moving experience in the process.

In the first episode, titled“Nigeria: Past is Present”,_**Black Panther: Wakanda Forever**_ director Ryan Coogler states, "Soundtracks like this just don't happen anymore. With the high percentage of these songs that are embedded in the movie,and to this level of cultural specificity."

In the episode Coogler and composer Ludwig Göransson work together in Lagos, Nigeria, which is at the center of a rapidly growing, dynamic musical scene. Focusing on the themes of past versus present and technology versus tradition, Göransson starts each recording day working with traditional musicians and ends the day working with modern recording artists, including Fireboy DML, Bloody Civilian and Busiswa.
