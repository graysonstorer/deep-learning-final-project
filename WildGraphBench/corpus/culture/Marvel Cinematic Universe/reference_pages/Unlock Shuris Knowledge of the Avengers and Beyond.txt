Possessing one of the most brilliant minds in the world, the Chief Science Officer of Wakanda, and Black Panther's sister, [Shuri](https://www.marvel.com/characters/shuri) strives to improve the future for all Wakandans and expand her knowledge.

An in-world book from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, [_**The Wakanda Files**_](https://www.quartoknows.com/books/9780760365441/The-Wakanda-Files-A-Technological-Exploration-of-the-Avengers-and-Beyond.html)—compiled by request of Shuri—is a collection of papers, articles, blueprints, and notes amassed throughout history by Wakanda’s War Dogs.

THE WAKANDA FILES by Troy Benjamin

In a nod to Wakandan technology, the pages of the book have a printed layer of UV ink with content that is visible only under the accompanying Kimoyo bead–shaped UV light.

Wakanda has been on the forefront of what is technologically possible. Their ability to stay ahead of the rest of the world is second only to their ability to keep themselves hidden. As the architect behind many of Wakanda’s great advancements, Shuri is constantly seeking ways to improve what has come before. To aid in her search, she researches the past for context, reference, and inspiration by compiling _The Wakanda Files_.
