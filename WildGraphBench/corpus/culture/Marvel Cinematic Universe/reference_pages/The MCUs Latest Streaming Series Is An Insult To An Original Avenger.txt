The MCU's Latest Streaming Series Is An Insult To An Original Avenger
=====================================================================

Marvel's new docuseries showcases the powerful female superheroes of the MCU, but MPower presents Marvel Studios' latest insult against an Avenger.

![Image 8: scarlett johansson as black widow with the women of marvel in mpower](https://web.archive.org/web/20230318183126/https:/screenrant.com/mcu-mpower-insult-black-widow-legacy/)

Marvel Studios' has delivered their latest insult against the MCU's [**Black Widow**](https://web.archive.org/web/20230318183126/https://screenrant.com/tag/black-widow/) with their new streaming docuseries for Disney+. _MPower_ explores the stories of the female superheroes of the MCU, released on March 8, 2023, in conjunction with International Women's Day. Showcasing the women of _Black Panther's_ Wakanda, Captain Marvel, the Scarlet Witch, and the female Guardians of the Galaxy, _MPower_ presents an opportunity for female superheroes to take the spotlight. While it's important to put the women of the MCU front and center, both in front of and behind the camera, _MPower_ neglects one hero who was pivotal to the MCU.

The presence of female superheroes in the MCU has grown significantly in recent years, with Phase 4 especially introducing many powerful women to the franchise. After years of comic book movies being male-dominated, it's fantastic to see more women represented as some of the most extraordinary people in the multiverse. However, while it's important to showcase the MCU stories of [_Guardians of the Galaxy's_ Gamora and Nebula](https://web.archive.org/web/20230318183126/https://screenrant.com/guardians-galaxy-thanos-nebula-implant-trick-explained/), _Black Panther's_ Queen Ramonda, and _Captain Marvel's_ Carol Danvers, one of the most recognizable heroes has once again been forgotten, as Natasha Romanoff, a.k.a. Black Widow, is not included in _MPower_ alongside her MCU family.

Black Widow Was An Original Avenger But Never Got Recognition
-------------------------------------------------------------

![Image 9: natasha romanoff aka black widow in the avengers](https://web.archive.org/web/20230318183126/https:/screenrant.com/mcu-mpower-insult-black-widow-legacy/)

Scarlett Johansson debuted as Natasha Romanoff in _Iron Man 2_, becoming the first female superhero introduced to the MCU and the only female member of the original Avengers team in _The Avengers_. Despite being featured very heavily throughout a multitude of MCU projects, including _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_, _Avengers: Age of Ultron_, _Avengers:_ _Infinity War,_ and _Avengers:_ _Endgame_, Romanoff never saw the recognition she deserved. A brief moment in _Age of Ultron_ began to explain a little of [Black Widow's MCU backstory](https://web.archive.org/web/20230318183126/https://screenrant.com/black-widow-natasha-origin-backstory-comics-changes-differences/), which sparked calls for a solo film featuring the original Avenger, which only arose after the character's death in _Endgame_.

Where many wanted an exploration of Natasha Romanoff's character, _Black Widow_ arguably focused too much on the dynamic between her and her adoptive Russian family, as if Romanoff herself wouldn't have been able to carry a solo film without backup. Black Widow's most powerful moment in the MCU came during _Avengers: Endgame_, which saw her sacrifice herself so that the remaining Avengers could acquire the Soul Stone and defeat Thanos. Aside from the obvious fridging, it could be argued that [Black Widow's death in _Avengers: Endgame_](https://web.archive.org/web/20230318183126/https://screenrant.com/hawkeye-endgame-black-widow-death-meaning/) came after very little character development had happened, despite being one of the MCU's original superheroes.

Marvel Has Ignored Black Widow Again With MPower
------------------------------------------------

![Image 10: mpower featuring the women of marvel](https://web.archive.org/web/20230318183126/https:/screenrant.com/mcu-mpower-insult-black-widow-legacy/)

It's possible that _MPower_ omitted a Black Widow-centric episode simply for the fact that she is no longer in the MCU, but as one of the original members of the Avengers, and after having appeared in more than ten MCU projects, it's a travesty that she's been ignored again. Johansson has had a tumultuous relationship with Marvel Studios, most recently finding herself in a legal battle with the studio over a dispute over earnings after _Black Widow_ was released simultaneously in theaters and on Disney+. Even so, this lawsuit was settled, and Johansson is reportedly working as a producer on an undisclosed upcoming MCU project.

Natasha Romanoff was always a comforting presence in the MCU, often acting as a sounding board for the likes of Tony Stark and Steve Rogers, and the development of [Black Widow's relationship with Clint Barton](https://web.archive.org/web/20230318183126/https://screenrant.com/mcu-black-widow-hawkeye-romance-avoid-good/) was incredibly touching. Having said that, it's unfortunate that the crux of her character development in the MCU was her relationships with the male heroes around her. It would have been brilliant if _MPower_ had featured a deep-dive into Black Widow's character, helping to develop her more as an individual, but this doesn't seem to be the plan unless a second season of the docuseries is produced.

How The MCU Can Still Do Black Widow Justice
--------------------------------------------

![Image 11: florence pugh as yelena belova the new black widow in the mcu](https://web.archive.org/web/20230318183126/https:/screenrant.com/mcu-mpower-insult-black-widow-legacy/)

Luckily, despite Black Widow's death in _Avengers: Endgame_, her legacy is set to continue in the MCU with the introduction of characters such as Yelena Belova, Alexei Shostakov, and Melina Vostokoff, her surrogate Russian family. Florence Pugh has already made another MCU appearance after _Black Widow_ in _Hawkeye_, which saw her fighting, albeit with misplaced anger, to protect her sister's honor. Though Melina's MCU future is unclear, Belova and Shostakov are set to become members of the [MCU's first Thunderbolts team](https://web.archive.org/web/20230318183126/https://screenrant.com/thunderbolts-mcu-team-members-origin-comics-explained/) in _Thunderbolts_, which could further solidify the impact of Natasha Romanoff's **Black Widow** on the MCU.

Kai Young is a Senior Features Writer for Screen Rant. Based in sometimes-sunny Brighton, UK, he graduated with a master’s degree in Creative Performance Practice from London South Bank University in 2019, having a passion for performing live on stage and creative writing, whether that be playscripts, poetry, or stories. He has a background in reviewing films and TV shows on Instagram. He's a lover of all things MCU, but also enjoys the more experimental and indie side of cinema with his favourite genres including subtle science-fiction and psychological thrillers, particularly the films of Alex Garland, Mike Cahill, and Lars von Trier. When not writing or working, you can probably find him in the cinema or at home keeping up with the latest releases.
