Betty Brant of _The Daily Bugle_ has some "burning questions" for Peter Parker in an official TikTok video promoting Sony and Marvel Studios'_[Spider-Man: No Way Home](https://www.cbr.com/tag/spider-man-3/)_.

The video, shared by the official _Daily Bugle_[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@thedailybugleofficial/video/7043907981393825071?sender_device=pc&sender_web_id=6923840295071663622&is_from_webapp=v1&is_copy_url=0) account, reveals that Betty (Angourie Rice) has apparently graduated from the Midtown News team and now works for _The Daily Bugle_-- the controversial news site created by resident Spider-Man-hater J. Jonah Jameson (J.K. Simmons) -- where she hosts her own show, _Burning Questions with Betty Brant_. Making an appearance on the show is none other than Spidey himself, Peter Parker (Tom Holland).

Right of the bat, _The Daily Bugle_'s anti-Spider-Man bias is apparent, with Peter's name graphic reading, "Peter 'Spider-Menace' Parker: Public Enemy #1."Peter's longtime classmate doesn't seem to be doing much in the way of calming his nerves, either. The interview is being held in a brooding, intimate setting, with Betty herself asking leading questions.

"Tell me, if the spider that gave you your powers were here right now, what would you say? Would you say thanks, or thanks for nothing?'" Betty asks. "I would say thanks," Peter replies. Betty then emphasizes, "For nothing?" The interview is then cut off, with Betty passing it back to Jameson, who promises to get to the bottom of Peter's "web of lies."

Classic Spider-Man character J. Jonah Jameson joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe in 2019's _Spider-Man: Far From Home_, with Simmons reprising the role from director Sam Raimi's original _Spider-Man_ film trilogy. While Spidey defeated the villain Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) in _Far From Home_,it was Mysterio who got the last laugh by using Jameson's _Daily Bugle_ platform to posthumously reveal the hero's identity to the world.

_No Way Home_ picks up immediately after the fact. Desperate to make the world forget he's Spider-Man, Peter enlists the aid of Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch). After Peter's interference botches the spell, however, the MCU starts getting visitors in the form of villains from Raimi's _Spider-Man_ trilogy and Marc Webb's _The Amazing Spider-Man_ duology.

While some fans may be surprised to see the MCU's young and fairly no-nonsense take on Betty Brant accept an internship at an outlet like the MCU's _Daily Bugle_, the character's comic book counterpart has a long history with the publication, dating back to when it was just a newspaper. In the comics, Betty actually dropped out of high school to become Jameson's secretary at the _Bugle_. She was also Peter Parker's first major love interest, coming even before Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson.

That said, Betty is arguably even better known for her romance with Need Leeds (played in the MCU by Jacob Batalon), which was loosely adapted in _Far From Home_. Prior to the MCU days, Betty Brant was indeed a _Daily Bugle_ employee Raimi's _Spider-Man_ films, in which she was played by Elizabeth Banks.
