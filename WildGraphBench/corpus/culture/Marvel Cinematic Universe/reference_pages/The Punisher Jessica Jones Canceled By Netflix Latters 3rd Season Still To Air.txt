**(UPDATED with [Marvel](https://deadline.com/tag/marvel/) Statement) EXCLUSIVE:**Exactly a month after the launch of its second season on [Netflix](https://deadline.com/tag/netflix/), Marvel’s _[The Punisher](https://deadline.com/tag/the-punisher/)_ has had to bite the bullet as has _[Jessica Jones](https://deadline.com/tag/jessica-jones/)._

[Marvel & Hulu Ink Pact For 'Howard The Duck' Animated Series + More - TCA](https://deadline.com/2019/02/marvel-hulu-howard-the-duck-the-offenders-tigra-and-dazzler-hit-monkey-modok-1202554521/ "Related Article")

As the only two series from the TV arm of the comic giant still left on the streamer, there will be no Season 3 of the [Jon Bernthal](https://deadline.com/tag/jon-bernthal/) led vigilante series, I’ve learned. The completed third season of the [Krysten Ritter](https://deadline.com/tag/krysten-ritter/) starring _Jessica Jones_ will still appear on the streamer but will be put on ice for good after that.

This marks the end of the multi-series, big bucks and big ambitions relationship between Marvel and Netflix that started in 2013 with the announcement of four series and a _The Defenders_ limited series.

“_Marvel’s The Punishe_ r will not return for a third season on Netflix,” Netflix confirmed today to Deadline. “Showrunner Steve Lightfoot, the terrific crew, and exceptional cast including star Jon Bernthal, delivered an acclaimed and compelling series for fans, and we are proud to showcase their work on Netflix for years to come,” the streamer added.

“In addition, in reviewing our Marvel programming, we have decided that the upcoming third season will also be the final season for _Marvel’s Jessica Jones_,” Netflix also made official this President’s Day. “We are grateful to showrunner Melissa Rosenberg, star Krysten Ritter and the entire cast and crew, for three incredible seasons of this groundbreaking series, which was recognized by the Peabody Awards among many others”.

“We are grateful to Marvel for five years of our fruitful partnership and thank the passionate fans who have followed these series from the beginning.”

The [Jeph Loeb](https://deadline.com/tag/jeph-loeb/)-led Marvel TV issued their own words of celebration and farewell after Deadline exclusively broke the news of the duel cancelation – with a kicker shout out to _Daredevil_, the first of the Marvel series to air on Netflix on April 10, 2015.

> It had never been done before. Four separate television series, each with different super-talented showrunners, writers, directors, cast and crew, coming out months apart and then …they would meet in a single event series all set in the heart of New York City. We called them The Defenders.
> 
> 
> And together we were thrilled by stories of Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist and even the Punisher joined in! They said it couldn’t be done.But Marvel assembled amazing teams to write, produce, direct, edit, and score 13 seasons and 161 one-hour episodes. Take a moment and go online and look at the dazzling list of actors, writers, directors, and musicians who graced us with the very best of their craft.
> 
> 
> We loved each and every minute of it.
> 
> 
> And we did it all for you — the fans — who cheered for us around the world and made all the hard work worth it.
> 
> 
> On behalf of everyone at Marvel Television, we couldn’t be more proud or more grateful to our audience. Our Network partner may have decided they no longer want to continue telling the tales of these great characters… but you know Marvel better than that,” the company added.
> 
> 
> As Matthew Murdock’s Dad once said, ‘The measure of a man is not how he gets knocked to the mat, it’s how he gets back up. To be continued…!

Though the decision not to bring _Punisher_ back for more has been rumored for weeks, Netflix and Marvel waited until after the January 18 debuting 13-episode Season 2 had been on the streamer for several weeks before making the cancellation official. The end of _Jones_ comes as more of a shocker – though I hear the end of the upcoming third and final season will serve as a savory series finale.

The news of the end of _Punisher_ and _Jessica Jones_ follows the revelation that _Walking Dead_ alum Bernthal is [set to join](https://deadline.com/2019/01/vera-farmiga-jon-bernthal-join-new-lines-sopranos-prequel-1202534868/) New Line’s _The Sopranos_ prequel feature, which currently has the working title of _The Many Saints of Newark._ In part it was because of new roles and new work like _The Sopranos_ pic _,_ the streamer didn’t want to have the creators and cast for either show hanging on waiting for renewals that clearly weren’t in the cards

Bernthal took to social media this morning to offer a cryptic farewell of sorts:

I’m endlessly grateful to the comic fans and the men and women of the Armed Services and law enforcement community who Frank means so much to. Thank you to the USMC and all the wonderful soldiers who trained me. Go Hard. Be safe.](https://www.instagram.com/p/BuB1v9eFnKy/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_medium=loading)

After _Iron Fist_, _Luke Cage_ and _Daredevil_ were all given the chop [late last year by the streamer](https://deadline.com/2018/11/daredevil-canceled-netflix-3-seasons-1202511521/), the unplugging of further seasons of the blood and bullet strewn Frank Castle saga should really come as no surprise. With new and old Marvel content a big component of the upcoming [Disney](https://deadline.com/tag/disney/)+ streaming service, the final stage of the disentangling of the once burgeoning relationship between the House of Mouse and Netflix has now become more a matter of when and how not if.

Additionally, the Loeb-run Marvel TV inked a four-series and one special deal with the soon-to-be Disney dominated Hulu on February 11 that will surely become the new focus of the comic giant’s small screen division.

As a part of the Marvel and Netflix collaboration that came together six years ago, _Jessica Jones_ the TV series was the second series in the arrangement to launch on the streamer after _Daredevil_.

Starring _Breaking Bad_ alum Ritter in the title role of the emotionally shattered and hard living super powered P.I., _Jones_ Season 1 debuted on November 15, 2015, with the second season launching on March 8, 2018. A third run of the critically acclaimed show about the _Defenders_ member was ordered by Netflix back on April 12 last year

![Image 15](https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/daredevil.jpg?w=370&h=547)

First introduced in the Netflix universe [with the March 18, 2016 launching second season of _Daredevil,_](https://deadline.com/2016/03/daredevil-season-2-review-elodie-yung-elektra-jon-bernthal-netflix-marvel-video-1201721255/) the Punisher is a ruthless and mercilessly fatal hunter of criminals who has long challenged, to be polite, the Marvel moral code since he appeared in the comics in early 1974.

After WME repped Bernthal was announced in 2015 for the role in the Man Without Fear series, the character was given his own spinoff show. in 2016. Season 1 of _The Punisher_ debuted on November 2017. Though a New York Comic Con panel for the firearms filled show was wiped off the schedule after the tragic mass shooting in Las Vegas [on October 2, 2017,](https://deadline.com/2017/10/las-vegas-shooting-mandalay-bay-route-91-harvest-deaths-injured-1202180308/) a second season pickup was made public[just weeks later.](https://deadline.com/2017/12/the-punisher-renewed-season-2-netflix-1202225470/)

Now, despite the last upcoming run of the final season of _Jessica Jones_ later this year, the Marvel days at Netflix are deader than someone who rubbed Frank Castle the wrong way – and that’s dead.

1.   Matt • _on_ Feb 18, 2019 8:36 am What a surprise… ![Image 21: 🙄](https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/svg/1f644.svg)

 So, it’s obvious, now ![Image 22: 😅](https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/wpcom-smileys/twemoji/2/svg/1f605.svg), that it wasn’t the rating’s fault.

2.   Taki taki • _on_ Feb 18, 2019 8:51 am Luke cage,Defenders and Iron fist should be permanently cancelled. However,Daredevil, the Punisher and Jessica Jones should continue on Hulu. Iron Fist and Luke Cage could be replaced by Moon Knight, Blade,Ghost Rider, etc.

 Marvel TV has produced four great shows(Daredevil,Punisher, Agents of shield and Jessica Jones).All of the rest are either mediocre or bad and that should change in my opinion.

    *    • _on_ Feb 18, 2019 12:03 pm The first season of Luke Cage was ok, the second of Jessica jons was less than Mediocre. Iron Fisth had a few good things in the second… but not enough. In this last, the protagonist was always the big problem. Crappy casting.

    *   Jim • 5 hours ago  It doesn’t matter….these were co-produced by Netflix and there is a contract which prohibits the series from being continued elsewhere for a certain period of time. It will be a couple of years before Marvel can continue any of these series on Hulu.

    *    • _on_ Feb 18, 2019 10:58 am Why should Netflix keep funding shows that Disney is going to be pulling for their own streaming service. You can’t really fault Netflix here. Disney is screwing them over big time by pulling all Disney content to make it exclusive to their own services. In my opinion it was clear this was going to happen.. And I have to laugh because it’s kinda like Netflix just said FU to Disney.

    *   Keith • 7 hours ago  You’re blaming the wrong company. This is all on Disney. They do not want any competition for the new streaming service so they ended the their contracts with Netflix.

            *    • 2 hours ago  Disney OWNS Marvel.. You realize this means you can’t make a series at all with those superheroes without Disney giving approval right?

    *    • _on_ Feb 18, 2019 11:12 am Very disappointed with Netflix. Almost every show we watch has been or is being canceled and to add to this, the monthly price keeps going up. 3 years ago we paid $9.99 and it’s about to go up to $15.99 Due to this, many people I know will be canceling their subscription and I probably will as well [Reply](https://deadline.com/2019/02/the-punisher-jessica-jones-canceled-netflix-marvel-krysten-ritter-jon-bernthal-1202535835/?replytocom=2427992#respond)    

6.    • _on_ Feb 18, 2019 9:09 am Oh come Netflix! I was really looking forward to the 3rd season of the punisher! Why?! I’m so disappointed! Please dont shut it out yet.

    *    • _on_ Feb 18, 2019 1:40 pm I will not subscribe to Disney streaming, ever. I am really ticked off with Netflix for getting rid of Punisher , Daredevil, Iron Fist and Jessica Jones. Are you also going to dump The Umbrella Academy? That would also be shameful.

11.   Sam • _on_ Feb 18, 2019 9:17 am Oh come on. Netflix should create its own exclusive shows more till remove this deficiency.

 I heard Series based on video games like The Witcher and Resident Evil are coming to Netflix. Therefore, Metal Gear Solid, Silent Hill, Tekken would be great to fill up place of Marvel’s.

12.   Gina • _on_ Feb 18, 2019 9:19 am And Simon Cowell is apparently taking to Netflix about getting X-factor on there. The reason we have Netflix is to get away from that b*****ks on uk TV. The Punisher is brilliant and it’s a shame technicalities over business rights means the fans lose out but then hey, I wouldn’t want to see what Disney would do to it anyway, I like all the blood, gore and revenge! : ( [Reply](https://deadline.com/2019/02/the-punisher-jessica-jones-canceled-netflix-marvel-krysten-ritter-jon-bernthal-1202535835/?replytocom=2427815#respond)    
13.    • _on_ Feb 18, 2019 9:22 am Well that sucks, don’t know why they would take off Marvel from Netflix, I know Netflix sucks I always hated it, was never a fan but the only reason I got back in to it was because of the Punisher. Nd now when that show is completely off I’ll be happily logging off and erasing it from my apps Nd happily sticking to Hulu. Now that’s a great app u could watch new Nd old movies, shows, Nd also live entertainment not like Netflix just watching old stuff all the time , things I’ve already seen b4 and get bored off it really quick.

15.    • _on_ Feb 18, 2019 9:24 am The Punisher didnt even have bad ratings from what I read! Jon played a great Punisher and this show did not deserve the axe. The same goes for Daredevil.

    *   KRey • 7 hours ago  The Punisher series with Jon Bernthal was the one the Best Punisher/Marvel series and Netflix getting you all amped up for The Punisher series and to cancel it after only 2 Seasons is missed up I hope they pick it up on Disney streaming service with Jon Bernthal returning as Frank Castle aka the Punisher but netflix current crop of movies and shows they have are lacking in quality now and Daredevil and The Punisher were quality shows and I seriously disappointed in cancellation of all Netflix Marvel shows.

18.   ZzZ • _on_ Feb 18, 2019 9:34 am To everyone raging against Netflix for these Marvel series cancellations, do not worry! Soon you’ll be able to watch them all on Disney’s new streaming platform for the price of yet another subscription service. Cord cutting has never been so expensive! Yay!

19.    • _on_ Feb 18, 2019 9:53 am “Bring back Jessica Jones.” Did you guys saying this MISS the part of the headline that literally says “latter’s third season still to air”?

That means are STILL going to release Jessica Jones season 3 and make no more after that comes out. They’re not going to scrap a whole unreleased season after spending time and money producing it.

21.    • _on_ Feb 18, 2019 9:54 am Why are yall blaming Netflix? Disney bought Marvel and they’re going to do their own version of netflix because of how successful the netflix platform is. Netflix doesnt want to lose these shows, but the soon to be Earth Overlords at Disney want Netflix to lose them so we cancel our Netflix accounts and give Disney even more money it doesnt need lol.

22.    • _on_ Feb 18, 2019 9:57 am Many of the people in this comment section didn’t even read the article and just read the title before they commented. Do you all not understand that this decision was not up to Netflix? They HAD to do this because they do not own Marvel, Disney does. Since Disney is now launching their own streaming service, they stopped their Marvel deal with Netflix so they can start their own Marvel shows, and other shows, on their own platform. It’s all business, Netflix would not be dumb enough to randomly cancel a show that was doing well. It was done for Disney +. It’s frustrating though that Disney coming late to the streaming era has caused us to lose some great shows that were on Netflix. We know Disney + is gonna try to recreate them but once something has been “Disneyfied” it’s usually not great sadly.
