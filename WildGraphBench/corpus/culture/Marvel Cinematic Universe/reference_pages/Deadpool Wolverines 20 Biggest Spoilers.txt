# Deadpool & Wolverine's 20 Biggest Spoilers

Warning! Spoilers ahead for _Deadpool & Wolverine_.

### Summary

*   _Deadpool & Wolverine_ offers exciting surprises for Marvel fans, including cameos such as Dafne Keen's _X-23_ , Chris Evans' Johnny Storm, and Wesley Snipes' Blade.

In true [MCU](https://screenrant.com/tag/mcu/) fashion, _**[Deadpool & Wolverine](https://screenrant.com/tag/deadpool-3/)**_ offers a plethora of exciting twists and surprises that are bound to thrill any die-hard Marvel fan. After several years of anticipation, Ryan Reynolds' Deadpool and Hugh Jackman's Wolverine finally appear together on the big screen, this time in a proper MCU movie released after the end of [Fox's extensive _X-Men_ movie franchise](https://screenrant.com/x-men-movies-fox-timeline-best-order-watch/). Such a significant event cannot take place with a small scope or a limited cast, which is why only part of [_Deadpool & Wolverine_'s star-studded cast](https://screenrant.com/deadpool-3-cast-characters-confirmed/) had been confirmed before the movie's July 2024 release.

Similar to massive crossover events such as _Avengers: Infinity War_ and _Avengers: Endgame_, a large portion of the excitement behind _Deadpool & Wolverine_ lies in its spoilers. Returning characters like Aaron Stanford's Pyro, Tyler Mane's Sabretooth, and Dafne Keen's X-23 were revealed gradually to heighten expectations. However, these reveals barely scratched the surface of all that _Deadpool & Wolverine_ had to offer. From completely unexpected cameos to multiverse-defining changes and potential [_Deadpool & Wolverine_ sequel teases](https://screenrant.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-2-updates-mcu-future-explained/), Shawn Levy's _Deadpool & Wolverine_ is filled to the brim with fan-pleasing surprises.

20  Deadpool Tries To Join The Avengers And Happy Hogan Rejects Him
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Deadpool Technically Had A Chance To Join The Avengers Before Meeting Wolverine

The only time _Deadpool & Wolverine_ visits [the MCU's Earth-616](https://screenrant.com/earth-616-or-19999-the-mcus-universe-number-finally-has-an-official-answer/) is at the beginning, when Deadpool uses Cable's time travel machine to enter the MCU's main timeline and apply for a role in the Avengers. **Happy Hogan interviews Wade, but ultimately rejects him because Wade wants to become an Avenger to feel better about himself instead of helping others**. Although Deadpool insults Happy due to his nerves, Happy motivates Deadpool to keep going and says that the Avengers will keep an eye on him. Iron Man's second arc reactor and Captain America shield prototype can be spotted in Happy's office.

This scene takes place in 2018, before the events of _Avengers: Infinity War_ , meaning that Deadpool's MCU debut technically happened while Tony Stark was still alive and Captain America was still active.

19  Deadpool & Wolverine Introduces The Concept Of A Multiversal Anchor Being
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Every Universe Has A Central Character Whose Death Signals Annihilation

When [TVA agent Paradox](https://screenrant.com/deadpool-3-mr-paradox-origins-powers-explained/) brings Deadpool to the TVA headquarters, he explains to Wade that his universe, Earth-10005, is destined to die due to Wolverine's death in _Logan_. Acording to Paradox, **Hugh Jackman's original Wolverine is Earth-10005's**_**"anchor"**_— an individual who's so essential to their respective timeline that their death kicks off an inevitable apocalypse, which can take up to two thousand years. Taking this into account, characters like Earth-616's Iron Man and Tom Hardy's Venom are candidates for their respective universes' anchor individuals.

Paradox also tells Deadpool that while his adventures with Cable's time-travel device were amusing, they weren't too dangerous for the Sacred Timeline.

18  Marvel Confirms That Fox’s X-Men Franchise Is A Single Universe
-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Fox’s X-Men Timelines Are Suggested To Be A Single Continuity

For years, [Fox's self-contradicting _X-Men_ timeline](https://screenrant.com/x-men-movie-timeline-explained/) led fans to theorize that the _X-Men_ movie franchise was actually a collection of different timelines, with _Logan_ taking place in its own separate universe. However, **_Deadpool & Wolverine_ acknowledges the events of _Logan_ and the first two _Deadpool_ movies as part of the wider _X-Men_ continuity**. Although various inconsistencies warrant the existence of branching and parallel timelines, _Deadpool & Wolverine_ makes it clear that Hugh Jackman's previous Wolverine performances make up the "anchor" Logan variant, and that Deadpool exists in that main _X-Men_ universe as well — regardless if that retroactively creates plot holes in previous _X-Men_ movies.

The first two _Deadpool_ movies take place in an ambiguous setting. They're set in the present day, but the young _X-Men_ cast makes a cameo, Yukio is different from her _The Wolverine_ variant, and Colossus is different from his original _X-Men_ trilogy variant.

17  Paradox Wants To Fast-Track The Destruction Of Dying Timelines
------------------------------------------------------------------

### TVA Agent Paradox Created The Time Ripper To Supposedly Improve Loki’s Sacred Timeline

Agent Paradox shows his true colors when he reveals to Deadpool that he wants to speed up Earth-10005's destruction in order to rise through the TVA's ranks instead of watching Deadpool's universe wither away and die for millennia. To achieve this, **Paradox created a "Time Ripper", which accelerated the process and doomed every single inhabitant of the original _X-Men_ universe without their knowledge**. When activated, the Time Ripper's effects on Earth-10005 look quite a lot like _Loki_ season 2's spaghettification — the very fabric of reality ripping itself apart as it gets erased out of existence.

Paradox plans and executes his plan secretly, as he's disappointed that the TVA's new administration has abandoned brutal yet effective practices like timeline pruning.

16  Henry Cavill Appears As A Multiverse Variant Of Wolverine
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Hugh Jackman Is No Longer The Only Actor To Play Wolverine In Live-Action

When Deadpool tries to find a Wolverine variant who can replace the anchor Logan, he comes across several Wolverine variants who aren't suitable for the job. Deadpool meets [a Wolverine under his tuxedo-wearing Patch identity](https://screenrant.com/patch-wolverine-variant-deadpool-3-explained/), a Wolverine who's in the middle of fighting the Hulk while wearing a tan-and-brown costume, a short Wolverine, a Wolverine who's crucified in a field of skulls (reminiscent of Logan's torture in _X-Men #251_), and an especially violent Wolverine who's wearing his comic-book Apocalypse suit. Most notably, **Deadpool meets _"Callverine"_ — a rugged Wolverine variant played by Henry Cavill, who punches Deadpool in the face.**

Deadpool throws a jab at DC when he realizes one Wolverine is played by Henry Cavill, offering him a better role at Marvel. Deadpool also mocks The Rock's _"hierarchy of power"_ promotion for _Black Adam_ and describes Wolverine's masked look as a Batman who can actually move his neck.

##### [Deadpool & Wolverine Story Recap: 12 Things To Know From Previous Marvel Movies & Shows](https://screenrant.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-story-recap/ "Deadpool & Wolverine Story Recap: 12 Things To Know From Previous Marvel Movies & Shows")

Deadpool & Wolverine is in many ways a love-letter to Fox’s superhero movies, but it also draws notably from the MCU’s most recent developments.

15  Hugh Jackman Is Made Shorter With CGI To Match Wolverine's Comic-Accurate Height
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Marvel Finally Acknowledges How Tall Hugh Jackman Is Compared To The Comics' Wolverine

One of the Wolverine variants Deadpool meets in his quest is a Logan who looks almost exactly like the anchor Wolverine, with the caveat that he's just as short as the comic book character. In the source material, Wolverine is supposed to be around 5'3" (1.60m), almost one full foot shorter than Hugh Jackman, who's 6'2" (1.88 m). **_Deadpool & Wolverine_'s short Wolverine variant might be even shorter than 5'3"**, which makes for a jarring picture due to Hugh Jackman's body proportions.

Apart from the actor's then-narrow filmography, Hugh Jackman's height was subject of doubt and criticism back when he was cast as Wolverine for 2000's _X-Men_ .

14  Chris Evans Returns To The MCU As The Human Torch (& Gets Killed)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Chris Evans’ Human Torch Is Deadpool & Wolverine’s Unexpected Comedy Relief Character

Another exciting cameo in _Deadpool & Wolverine_ comes courtesy of Chris Evans, who makes an epic entrance defending Deadpool and Wolverine from Cassandra Nova's henchmen. When Deadpool gets ready to witness Evans' character say _"Avengers assemble!"_, he realizes that Evans isn't playing Captain America; rather, **Chris Evans reprises his Johnny Storm a.k.a. Human Torch role from Tim Story's _Fantastic Four_ movies**. Unfortunately, Pyro effortlessly puts out Johnny Storm's fire powers, and Cassandra Nova rips Johnny's skin and flesh off after Deadpool reveals that Johnny insulted her.

_Deadpool & Wolverine_ marks Chris Evans' first MCU appearance after Steve Rogers' retirement in _Avengers: Endgame_ , opening the door for future MCU roles in the form of other Captain America or Human Torch variants.

13  Jennifer Garner’s Elektra Returns In Deadpool & Wolverine
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Elektra Is A Deadlier Assassin Under Cassandra Nova’s Reign

Deadpool and Wolverine meet the few surviving members of the resistance in the Void, starting with Elektra. Twenty-one years after her Marvel debut in _Daredevil_ and twenty years after her own spinoff movie in _Elektra,_**Jennifer Garner returns as the assassin Elektra Natchios in _Deadpool & Wolverine_**. This time, Elektra wears a dark suit and sports strands of gray hair, and she's visibly much deadlier than ever before. According to her and her allies, a Daredevil variant who worked alongside them perished some time before Deadpool & Wolverine's arrival.

Ben Affleck's Daredevil witnessed Elektra's death at the hands of Bullseye in _Daredevil_ (2003).

12  Wesley Snipes Returns As Blade Despite Previous Friction With Ryan Reynolds
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Wesley Snipes’ Blade Makes His On-Screen Debut In The MCU Before Mahershala Ali’s

**The most surprising actor return in _Deadpool & Wolverine_ might be Wesley Snipes', who reprises his Blade role twenty-six years after his Marvel debut**.In 2004, [_Blade Trinity_'s production became infamous for its behind-the-scenes drama](https://screenrant.com/blade-trinity-behind-scenes-production-disaster-script-explained/), which led to a feud between Wesley Snipes and Ryan Reynolds, the latter of whom was playing Hannibal King. Add to that the fact that Wesley Snipes retired from acting, making his _Deadpool & Wolverine_ role all the more surprising. Snipes' Blade sports white strands of hair and at one point repeats his iconic line, _"some motherf*ers are always trying to ice-skate uphill"_.

Wesley Snipes' Blade brags that, unlike the Punisher, there will always be one Blade. Deadpool, knowing about Mahershala Ali's upcoming _Blade_ movie, sneers at the camera.

11  Channing Tatum’s Gambit Finally Gets To Play Gambit In Deadpool & Wolverine
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Channing Tatum Fulfills His Dream To Play A Comic-Accurate Gambit In The MCU

**Another member of the Void's resistance is Remy LeBeau a.k.a. Gambit, played by Channing Tatum**. For years, Channing Tatum wanted to play Gambit on the big-screen, reaching the point that a full _Gambit_ solo movie was set to be produced by Fox with Tatum in the lead role. However, the plans ultimately didn't pan out. In _Deadpool & Wolverine_, Channing Tatum's Gambit insists that his potential is still undiscovered, and his unintelligible French accent is a running gag among the Void's survivors. Tatum's Gambit is remarkably powerful and faithful to the source material.

Fox's _Gambit_ movie was cancelled by Disney in May 2019 after more than five years in development hell.

10  X-23 Survives The Events Of Deadpool & Wolverine
----------------------------------------------------

### Dafne Keen’s Laura Kinney Can Appear In Future MCU Movies

**The final member of the _Deadpool & Wolverine_'s resistance team is its leader, Dafne Keen's Laura Kinney a.k.a. X-23**. This older X-23 still retains the sunglasses she got from a gas store in _Logan_, and she explains to the new Wolverine that her Logan variant saved her life and the lives of many children. These details suggest that this X-23 variant is the same from James Mangold's _Logan_, which only raises questions about her presence in the Void. Regardless, Deadpool asks B-15 if she can save X-23 from the Void, and Laura joins Deadpool's friend group at the end.

Dafne Keen's X-23 variant in _Deadpool & Wolverine_ may be the same variant featured in _Logan_ , as the TVA likely wouldn't allow two X-23 variants to coexist in Earth-10005. Why X-23 was pruned is a mystery, however.

Deadpool & Wolverine didn't come cheap, so the latest MCU movie needs to make a significant impact at the box office to be considered successful.

9  Many Deadpool & Wolverine’s X-Men Cameo Characters Die Painful Deaths
------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Cassandra Nova’s Henchmen Become Cannon Fodder In The Void

**Most cameo characters meet a tragic end in _Deadpool & Wolverine_**. Johnny Storm gets torn to shreds by Cassandra Nova, Sabretooth gets decapitated by Wolverine, Juggernaut gets his feet sliced off by X-23, and Pyro gets his neck broken by Cassandra Nova. According to X-23's resistance group, Cassandra Nova crushed Magneto's skull and melted his helmet, while the Punisher, Quicksilver, and Daredevil died off-screen. Other minor characters such as Toad, Azazel, Lady Deathstrike, the Russian, and Callisto seem to die when Alioth arrives at Cassandra's base.

Cassandra Nova mentions a dead Doctor Strange variant, and Wolverine reveals that his universe's X-Men died when humanity attacked mutants.

8  The Entire Deadpool Corps Works For Cassandra Nova
-----------------------------------------------------

### Deadpool Fights His Own Variants On Earth-10005

When Deadpool and Wolverine go back to Earth-10005, they have to face [an army of Deadpool variants: the Deadpool Corps](https://screenrant.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-every-deadpool-variant/), who were ordered to kill Prime Deadpool and Wolverine by Cassandra Nova. **The Deadpool Corps is led by Lady Deadpool, who's accompanied by Kidpool, Headpool, Babypool, and Cowboypool**. Despite knowing that he and Wolverine have a healing factor, Prime Deadpool uses Nicepool as a human shield and steals Dogpool from him. Prime Deadpool and Wolverine slice through the Deadpool Corps, but they all regenerate almost instantly. Fortunately, Peter arrives to calm everyone down, as every Deadpool in the multiverse has a Peter variant they love and admire.

Hugh Jackman's Wolverine wears his mask for the first time ever to fight the Deadpool Corps on Earth-10005.

7  Blake Lively Plays Lady Deadpool
-----------------------------------

### Taylor Swift Was Speculated To Be The Deadpool Variant

Much speculation surrounded Lady Deadpool, as theories about the actor playing her abounded. Some said that Taylor Swift would make a surprise appearance as the female Deadpool variant, while others theorized that Ryan Reynolds' wife Blake Lively was under the mask. Some even said that Ryan Reynolds himself was likely to be playing Lady Deadpool. **It turns out that Lady Deadpool never takes off her mask in _Wolverine & Deadpool_, but the credits confirm that she is played, or at least voiced, by Blake Lively**.

In the comics, Deadpool joins forces with Lady Deadpool and assembles the Deadpool Corps to defend the multiverse from complete annihilation.

6  Cassandra Nova Dies Trying To Destroy The Multiverse
-------------------------------------------------------

### Cassandra Nova Ends Up Helping Deadpool & Wolverine Destroy The Time Ripper

Wolverine spares Cassandra Nova's life in the Void, arguing that Charles Xavier would have given his twin sister a second chance. Yet, Cassandra seems to be genetically destined to be evil, and she travels to Earth-10005 to use the Time Ripper by herself, with the goal of wreaking havoc on Deadpool's timeline and the whole multiverse. Paradox explains to Deadpool how Cassandra can be stopped: someone needs to stop the machine from within, getting disintegrated in the process. **Wolverine decides to sacrifice himself to save Earth-10005, but Deadpool arrives to help him, leading the machine to disintegrate Cassandra Nova instead.**

The Time Ripper may work with the same technology as the Temporal Loom, but instead of controlling timelines, it accelerates their decay.

5  Loki’s Hunter B-15 Arrests TVA Agent Paradox
-----------------------------------------------

### Paradox Is The Newest TVA Worker To Be Dismissed From His Duties

Wunmi Mosaku reprises her role as B-15, who was ascended at the end of the _Loki_ season 2 finale. B-15 is informed that Paradox has created an unsanctioned machine to destroy timelines, and she arrives to capture him at the end of _Deadpool & Wolverine_. **Deadpool asks B-15 to save X-23 from the Void as a reward for thwarting Paradox's plans and she fulfills his wish.** When Deadpool asks her to rewrite Wolverine's timeline, she responds that Wolverine's tragic backstory made him a hero, meaning that there's nothing to fix.

Paradox probably received a less brutal punishment for his actions than Judge Ravonna Renslayer, who was sent to the Void in the _Loki_ season 2 finale.

4  Deadpool Befriends Wolverine And Takes Him To His Universe
-------------------------------------------------------------

### The X-Men Universe Has A Wolverine Once Again

**Having accepted his past as an unchangeable part of himself, Wolverine agrees to travel to Earth-10005 with Deadpool**. There, the two get ready to part ways, but Deadpool feels like he can't leave Wolverine alone. So, Wade invites Wolverine to his home and introduces him to all his friends. Thanks to B-15, X-23 is also there, which suggests that she will bond with this new Wolverine in Deadpool's universe. Given that all _Deadpool_ characters survive the events of _Deadpool & Wolverine_(including Domino and Cable, who don't appear on screen), future MCU movies can always bring them all back.

Although he isn't Earth-10005's original anchor, Hugh Jackman's new Wolverine variant is serving the same purpose.

3  Countless X-Men Timelines Still Exist Somewhere Out There
------------------------------------------------------------

### Deadpool & Wolverine Keeps The X-Men’s Many Timelines Intact For Future Crossovers

Despite what _Deadpool & Wolverine_'s multiversal premise suggested and what Disney's acquisition of 20th Century Fox implied, **the entirety of Fox's _X-Men_ movie universe remained intact by the end of Deadpool and Wolverine's first MCU adventure**. This leaves the door open for new _X-Men_ crossovers and cameos in future MCU projects, as well as a potential integration of Earth-10005's _X-Men_ characters into Earth-616. Other branches of the _X-Men_ universe, like the ones [_The Marvels_'s Beast](https://screenrant.com/the-marvels-beast-kelsey-grammer-explained/) and _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_' Professor X come from, could eventually send more mutant variants to the MCU's multiversal conflicts.

The true end of Fox's _X-Men_ timelines could still come in _Avengers: Secret Wars_ , which could rewrite every existing timeline and reboot the entire MCU multiverse.

2  Deadpool & Wolverine’s Mid-Credits Scene Pays Homage To Fox’s X-Men Franchise
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Marvel Studios Honors Fox’s Two-Decade X-Men Franchise With A Heartfelt Tribute Montage

Instead of an upcoming MCU project's tease or set-up, **_Deadpool & Wolverine_'s mid-credits scene is a montage sequence that pays homage to Fox's _X-Men_ movie franchise**, as well as other Marvel movies made by 20th Century Fox such as Elektra, _Daredevil_, _Fantastic Four_, _Fantastic Four: Rise off the Silver Surfer_, and _Fant4stic_. This heartfelt tribute to Fox's legacy is composed of behind-the-scenes footage and bloopers from all of these movies.

At one point, there were plans at 20th Century Fox to make a crossover between the _X-Men_ movie franchise and the Fantastic Four, specifically Josh Trank's version of Marvel's First Family.

1  Deadpool & Wolverine’s Post-Credits Scene Is A Quick Gag Involving Johnny Storm
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Deadpool Is Vindicated By Johnny Storm’s Comments About Cassandra Nova

**_Deadpool & Wolverine_'s post-credits scene ends the movie with a final gag that calls back to Johnny Storm's gory death at the hands of Cassandra Nova**. In it, Deadpool uses the TVA's monitors to replay his conversation with Johnny while captured, revealing that Johnny did insult Cassandra with the exact same words that Deadpool used. This one time, Deadpool wasn't exaggerating when quoting the late Human Torch.

Johnny Storm's foul-mouthed role in _Deadpool & Wolverine_ shares some similarities with Chris Evans' cameo in Shawn Levy and Ryan Reynold's _Free Guy_ , where he says _"what the sh*t"_ as he sees Reynolds' Guy wield Captain America's shield.
