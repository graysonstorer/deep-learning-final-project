LOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwired - June 23, 2016) -  Victory Hill Exhibitions' (VHE) global, interactive experience -- Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. (Scientific Training and Tactical Intelligence Operative Network) -- is now open to the public at Treasure Island Hotel and Casino on the world-famous Las Vegas Strip.

The Las Vegas opening comes shortly after Marvel's movie smash "Captain America: Civil War" took the world by storm, debuting in the United States on May 6 and grossing more than $1 billion worldwide to date.

The Las Vegas attraction includes an interactive journey through the Marvel Cinematic Universe, allowing guests to engage with the Hulk, Captain America, Thor, Iron Man and additional Avengers icons throughout. The experience also includes original props and costumes from legendary Marvel films, including a ten-foot Hulkbuster, Bruce Banner's laboratory, Captain America's motorcycle and much more.

"Las Vegas is synonymous with some of the most iconic names and brands in entertainment," said Ron Tan, CEO/President of VHE. "Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. is something that any Marvel fan from any generation will cherish, tying educational components and blockbuster films in to one incredible experience."

This marks the first time Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. has landed in the Western U.S., with prior premieres at Esplanade De La Defense in Paris (debuted in April 2016), in New York City's iconic Times Square and at The War Memorial of Korea in Seoul.

"Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. adds something truly unique to our city's landscape," said Phil Ruffin, billionaire and owner of Treasure Island Hotel & Casino. "Las Vegas is a town that always has the latest and greatest and in terms of a captivating fan experience, this is it. Whether visiting or local, we look forward to seeing many Marvel fans here at Treasure Island."

Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. Las Vegas is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily -- with last entry at 9 p.m. on the Las Vegas Strip.
