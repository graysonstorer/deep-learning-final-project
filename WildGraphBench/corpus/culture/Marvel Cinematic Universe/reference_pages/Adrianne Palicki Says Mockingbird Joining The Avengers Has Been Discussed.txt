 SHIELD star Adrienne Palicki says the transition has been discussed. 

By [Chris Tilly](http://people.ign.com/IGNUK-Chris)[Adrianne Palicki](http://www.ign.com/stars/adrianne-palicki "Adrianne Palicki") has been discussing her role as Bobbi Morse in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., calling the character “badass” and revealing that the possibility of her transitioning to The Avengers movies has been discussed.

Palicki will first play the Head of Hydra Security in forthcoming S.H.I.E.L.D. episode ‘A Hen in the Wolf House’ and told us “Bobbi Morse is another badass character. She was been working with S.H.I.E.L.D. for a bit… She gets along with the team very well.”

In the comics, the character of course becomes Mockingbird, marries Hawkeye, and joins up with the Avengers, and Palicki said that the chance to potentially join that big screen team was part of the appeal when she signed up for the role.

“Absolutely – that was one of the things that was discussed when I was coming on for the part, and you know, we’ll see what happens. It’s such a nice world that we live in that crossover can happen so often now which in the past it never really did so, to see these worlds come together on the small screen and the big screen is really cool.”

So would you like to see Palicki appear in Avengers 3? Let us know in the comments below, and look out for the actress in the forthcoming action flick John Wick, [which we have reviewed here](http://uk.ign.com/articles/2014/09/22/john-wick-review).![Image 4: IGN Logo](http://oystatic.ignimgs.com/src/core/img/widgets/global/page/globhead_dpad_red.png)

Chris Tilly is the Entertainment Editor for IGN in the UK and wants to see a Hawkeye-Mockingbird wedding. He can be found talking nonsense on both[Twitter](http://twitter.com/TillyTweets)and[MyIGN](http://people.ign.com/ignuk-chris).
