Hulu is officially joining the Marvel squad.

The streamer, as part of its NewFronts presentation Wednesday, has handed out a series pickup to Marvel drama _Runaways_. The 10-episode drama will premiere in 2018.

From _The O.C._ creators Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, who will serve as showrunners, _Runaways_ is based on the comics of the same name and centers on six teens who unite against a common foe: their parents. The cult classic [landed at Hulu in August](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/marvels-runaways-scores-pilot-order-920310) with a pilot and full-season script commitment. It is based on the beloved series by Brian K. Vaughan (_Y: The Last Man_) and Adrian Alphona.

Schwartz and Savage co-write and exec produce alongside Marvel head of television Jeph Loeb and Jim Chory. The series hails from ABC Signature, the cable-focused arm of ABC Studios, and Schwartz and Savage's Fake Empire banner. _Faking It_'s [Gregg Sulkin](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/hulus-marvel-drama-runaways-sets-cast-971531) stars _._

_Runaways_ is Hulu's first collaboration with Marvel and comes as the comic book powerhouse continues to expand its TV footprint. In addition to ABC's _Agents of SHIELD_— its first live-action scripted series — the comic book company also has _The Inhumans_(a straight-to-series drama launching in Imax theaters in a groundbreaking deal) set to debut in the fall on ABC. Beyond that, Marvel has Freeform's recent straight-to-series order _[New Warriors](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/squirrel-girl-tv-series-freeform-orders-marvels-new-warriors-991277),_ a slate of shows at Netflix including _Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist,_ mini-mashup _The Defenders_ as well as _The Punisher_.
