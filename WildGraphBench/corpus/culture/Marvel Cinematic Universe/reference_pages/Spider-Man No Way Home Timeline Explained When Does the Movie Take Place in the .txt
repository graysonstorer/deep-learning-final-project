# 'Spider-Man: No Way Home' Timeline Explained: When Does the Movie Take Place in the MCU?

[**_Spider-Man: No Way Home_**](https://collider.com/tag/spider-man-no-way-home/) is finally in theaters, shattering the Multiverse and making previous iterations of the Web Crawler canon in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. However, Multiverse shenanigans apart, the last chapter of **Tom Holland**’s [first _Spider-Man_ trilogy](https://collider.com/sony-spider-man-marvel-new-movies-tom-holland-amy-pascal/) offers fans another piece of the big timeline puzzle that’s Phase 4 so far. With four movies and five TV shows that mostly tell their self-contained story, it’s getting harder to figure out when each MCU event actually happens in relation to each other. Don’t worry, though. We are here to untangle the _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ timeline web and help you understand how MCU’s latest film fits with all other Phase 4 productions.

When Does ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ Take Place?

Short answer: the main events of _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ take place in November 2024. How can we be so confident? Well, we’ve known for a couple of years that **_Spider-Man: Far From Home_**, the last chapter of Marvel’s **_Infinity Saga_**, takes place in Summer 2024. In 2018, Thanos snapped his finger while wearing the Infinity Gauntlet and vaporized half the life in the universe. It took the Avengers five years to revert Thanos’ destructive wish, putting the **_Avengers: Endgame_** events in 2023. _Far From Home_ takes place after a whole school year when Peter Parker (**Tom Holland**) goes on a summer trip to Europe with his high school class. So, we can say for sure that everything that happens in _Far From Home_ takes place between June and September 2024.

The first scene of _No Way Home_[starts exactly as _Far From Home_’s events come to a shocking conclusion](https://collider.com/spider-man-no-way-home-opening-scene-tom-holland-comments/). In the mid-credits of _Far From Home_, J. Jonah Jameson (**J. K. Simmons**) reveals Spider-Man’s identity for the whole world after being convinced by Mysterio (**Jake Gyllenhaal**) that the Web-Crawler is a villain. This reveal takes place one week after Peter’s final battle against Mysterio in London, so we can place it in Summer 2024 at the earliest and early-October 2024 at the latest. _No Way Home_’s first act, then, deals with Peter’s secret identity being exposed and the legal prosecution the hero has to face after being accused of murder.

Although Peter’s secret identity plays a big part in _No Way Home_’s story, the movie doesn’t lose much time with Peter’s legal problems. With the help of a very special cameo, Peter is cleared of any crimes and can move on with his life. Well, not quite, since many people still believe Spider-Man is a criminal. To make matters worse, people all around Peter are suffering from the consequences of his hero life, which ultimately prevents his girlfriend MJ (**Zendaya**) and his best friend Ned (**Jacob Batalon**) from going to college.

The trio found out together that MIT is refusing their applications in a scene that takes place in the coffee shop where MJ works. While they are digesting the saddest news of their lives, the shop owner tells MJ she should take the Halloween decorations down, which means Peter’s legal trouble was solved around October 2024. The negative response from MIT arrived in November, after Halloween. At this moment, Peter decides to enlist Doctor Strange (**Benedict Cumberbatch**) to erase Spider-Man’s real identity from everyone’s memory. Unfortunately, the spell doesn’t work and instead brings visitors from other realities into the MCU. Peter’s fight against the Multiverse villains only takes a couple of days to end, which means _No Way Home_’s main events happen in November 2024.

There’s also an ending scene in December 2024, in the same coffee shop where Peter has read his MIT rejection letter. The Christmas decoration on the shop indicates we are close to the Holidays, something that’s ratified by the snow that falls from the skies and covers New York City. So, contrary to other MCU entries, _No Way Home_ gives us enough clues to figure out when its main events take place. But how does _No Way Home_ relate to different Phase 4 productions?

Where Does ‘Spider-Man: No Way Home’ Take Place in the Phase 4 Timeline?

From the other eight productions already released on MCU’s Phase 4, besides _No Way Home_, we only need to care about five. That’s because [**_Black Widow_** is a prequel](https://collider.com/when-does-black-widow-take-place-in-mcu-timeline/) set between **_Captain America: Civil War_** and **_Avengers: Infinity War_**, **_What If…?_** takes place in different corners of the Multiverse, and **_Loki_**’s time-travel adventures is not yet connected to Phase 4’s timeline. Even so, it’s worth noting that _Loki_’s first scene happens in the middle of _Endgame_’s time heist, making it the earliest entry of Phase 4.

Regarding the theatrical releases of the MCU, we know that [**_Eternals_** takes place at the same time Peter Parker is battling Mysterio in Europe](https://collider.com/eternals-timeline-explained/). As for **_Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings_**, we don’t know precisely when the film’s main events occur, but we know it is a world where Thanos has already been defeated for so long that life has returned to some kind of normalcy. So it’s safe to say Shang-Chi (**Simu Liu**) went through his super-hero journey somewhere around 2024.

As for Disney+’s TV shows, **_WandaVision_** takes place a few weeks after Thanos’ defeat, still in 2023. **_The Falcon and the Winter Soldier_**, on the other hand, takes place a few months after Steve Rogers (**Chris Evans**) gave his shield to Sam Wilson (**Anthony Mackie**), before _Far From Home_. Finally, with **_Hawkeye_** taking place right before Christmas, [likely in 2024 but possibly in 2025](https://collider.com/when-is-hawkeye-set-mcu-timeline-explained/), **_No Way Home_** is the second latest adventure of Phase 4.

Marvel still has some loose ends to explain for everything to make sense in the timeline. For instance, _No Way Home_ doesn’t seem to consider the events of _Eternals_, which pretty much changed Earth’s landscape. Also, so far, _Hawkeye_ didn’t acknowledge either _Eternals_ consequences of Spider-Man’s latest fistfights beneath New York’s skyscrapers. The events of _WandaVision_ and _Shang-Chi_ could very well happen out of public scrutiny. And _The Falcon and Winter Soldier_ conclusion is not that world-changing to need a nod from _No Way Home_ or _Hawkeye_. However, some significant events are happening worldwide, and if Marvel ignores how every production is connected, we might keep having trouble figuring out the MCU’s timeline. For the moment, though, we can only do our best while navigating the intricate web of the Multiverse.
