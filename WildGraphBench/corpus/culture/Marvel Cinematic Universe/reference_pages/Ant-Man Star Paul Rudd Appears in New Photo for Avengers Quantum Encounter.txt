It was recently announced that [some big Marvel stars will be featured](https://web.archive.org/web/20220408225051/https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/avengers-quantum-encounter-cast-paul-rudd-brie-larson-anthony-mackie-evangeline-lilly/) in the ship's Avengers: Quantum Encounter, including Ant-Man star, [Paul Rudd](https://web.archive.org/web/20220408225051/https://comicbook.com/category/paul-rudd/). A new photo features Rudd doing some work in costume for the attraction.

Director Chris Waitt took to Instagram yesterday to [celebrate Rudd's birthday](https://web.archive.org/web/20220408225051/https://comicbook.com/marvel/news/mark-ruffalo-marvel-fans-and-more-celebrate-ant-man-star-paul-rudds-birthday/)and included a photo of Rudd.

In addition to Rudd, Avengers: Quantum Encounter is expected to feature Evangeline Lilly (Hope van Dyne/Wasp), Brie Larson (Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel), and Anthony Mackie (Sam Wilson/Captain America).[According to the official Disney Parks blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20220408225051/https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2021/10/stars-of-the-marvel-cinematic-universe-assemble-for-first-of-its-kind-dining-adventure-aboard-the-disney-wish/), which revealed the casting news, "The show will follow Ant-Man and The Wasp as they host a presentation of the most powerful Super Hero technologies in the world, including a hands-on demonstration of the latest and greatest Pym Tech. But when Ultron turns up with an army of robot sentries eager to take control of this world-changing technology, Ant-Man and The Wasp will need all the help they can get to save the day – calling on Captain America, Captain Marvel and even the brave diners of the Disney Wish for back-up."

Other Marvel offerings on the Disney Wish will include _Marvel Super Hero Academy_, part of the reimagined Disney's Oceaneer Club, where kids ages 3 to 12 can participate in "a high-tech Avengers headquarters where young 'recruits' will train to be the next generation of Superheroes with the help of their own heroes," including Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Ant-Man and the Wasp. During their stay, guests can also watch classic and first-run Marvel films in the Disney Wish's screening rooms.
