# The Price Sony Paid For Rebooting 'Spider-Man'

Sony Corporation's[The](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man_in_film "Spider-Man in film")_[Amazing Spider-Man 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spider-Man\_in\_film "Spider-Man in film")_ has earned $549 million worldwide as of Sunday, after about a month of worldwide play. Under normal circumstances, such a film would be viewed as at least a solid hit if not an out-and-out smash. It may out-gross[Walt Disney](https://www.forbes.com/companies/walt-disney/)'s much-buzzed about _[Captain America: The Winter Soldier](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain\_America%3A\_The\_Winter\_Soldier "Captain America: The Winter Soldier")_, which has $695m and probably doesn't have much left in the can beyond crossing $700m, and there is no guarantee that 20th Century[Fox&#039;s](https://www.forbes.com/companies/fox/)_[X-Men: Days of Future Past](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men\_%28film\_series%29 "X-Men (film series)")_ can get high enough above its previous franchise high of $459m to challenge _[Spider-Man 2](http://www.amazon.com/Spider-Man-Motion-Picture-DVD-Trilogy/dp/B000UR9T8W%3FSubscriptionId%3D0G81C5DAZ03ZR9WH9X82%26tag%3Dzemanta-20%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB000UR9T8W "Spider-Man - The Motion Picture DVD Trilogy (Spider-Man / Spider-Man 2 / Spider-Man 3)")_ version 2.Yet as it marches toward a plausible $700m+ global total, the box office performance of _The Amazing Spider-Man 2_ feels incredibly disappointing. In the bid to reboot and then in the bid to copy Marvel,Sony's _Spider-Man_ franchise has lost its superiority.

_The Amazing Spider-Man_ earned $752 million worldwide two summers ago. That in itself was a low-water mark for the _Spider-Man_ series, but it was still Sony's seventh all-time top-grossing film. Once _The Amazing Spider-Man 2_ passes $625m, it will be Sony's eighth-biggest grosser behind _Amazing Spider-Man_ and ahead of _Hancock_($624.4m).Now there has certainly been a trend of sequels earning just a bit more than their predecessors worldwide, boosted by greater international interest even as the domestic gross somewhat drops. Twas the case with (for example)_[Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows](http://sherlockholmes2.warnerbros.com/ "Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows")_,_[Star Trek Into Darkness](https://www.directv.com/movies/Star-Trek-Into-Darkness-MUFVN1dRRHdVRE4zajBHY3lQZkRHdz09 "Star Trek Into Darkness")_, and nearly every animated sequel these days. But, putting aside that Spidey may not out-gross its predecessor worldwide either, those films were nowhere near as expensive as this $255m Spidey sequel (_Sherlock Holmes 2_ cost $120m while _Star Trek 2_ version 2 cost $190m), and they were only responsible for themselves._Amazing Spider-Man 2_ was supposed to not only be the break-out sequel in Sony's crown-jewel franchise but also get audiences hooked on an expanded Spider-Man universe.

The _Spider-Man_ franchise was once the very biggest franchise in Hollywood, as [Sam Raimi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Raimi "Sam Raimi")'s trilogy shattered records every step of the way (first film to open with $100m, first film to open with $150m, etc.) and earned near-$1 billion grosses back when there were only four movies ever to reach $1 billion. Now there are 18 such titles. More importantly, Spider-Man has returned in its new rebooted form and found itself no longer king of the proverbial comic book superhero mountain, but merely one of a handful of big franchises fighting for its piece of the pie. As someone who remembers the first _Spider-Man_ _'_ s race to $400m domestic back in 2002 when only five films had done so, the notion of a _Spider-Man_ sequel failing to cross $200m, which may just happen, off an opening weekend of $91m no less, is frankly beyond belief. Overseas grosses may save face (it's earned $56m in China), but the Spider-Man brand feels weaker than ever.

It is clear that _The Amazing Spider-Man 2_ fell victim to [the _Tomb Raider_ Trap](http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2013/06/25/can-man-of-steel-2-survive-the-tomb-raider-trap/). In short,I'm referring to a pattern whereby (arguably) artistically superior sequels to financially successful but generally disliked originals end up grossing less than the first films because so many got burned the last time around.Audiences showed up to _[The Amazing Spider-Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Amazing\_Spider-Man "The Amazing Spider-Man")_, but they didn't exactly walk away buzzing to their friends about it. Sandwiched between _The Avengers_(the ultimate superhero movie) and _The Dark Knight Rises_(sold as the ultimate comic book epic),_The Amazing Spider-Man_ was the runt of the litter. Even though _Amazing Spider-Man 2_ is arguably a better film than _Amazing Spider-Man_(the action scenes are eye-popping and it's not a glorified remake of Sam Raimi's _Spider-Man_), the grosses are not reflecting as much.

[Sony](https://www.forbes.com/companies/sony/)'s marketing campaign sold it as a villain-centric spectacular (because the villains were no one's favorite part of the Raimi films) instead of highlighting the one thing people liked about the first film (the Peter/Gwen romantic interludes).By all-but-exclaiming that _Amazing Spider-Man 2_ was mostly about setting up _[Amazing Spider-Man 4](http://www.theamazingspiderman.com/site/ "The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)")_ and the villain-centric spin-offs, the PR campaign (which absolutely drowned fans in clips and spoiler-ific trailers) basically sold a movie that didn't exist (most of the "Bad guys are coming for Peter!" bits in the trailers are not in the film). The marketing for _Amazing Spider-Man 2_(Spider-Man's greatest battle begins!)was less about _Amazing Spider-Man 2_ but rather implicitly about how cool a Spider-Man vs. Sinister Six movie a few years down the road was going to be.

Back in 2010, when the reboot was first announced, the alleged intent was go to smaller, with the intent to tell a teen romance story set around high school fashioned after Brian Michael Bendis's _Ultimate Spider-Man_ comic. The phrase "Spider-Man meets _Twilight_" was thrown around a lot, with the core idea being that the reboot would be an under-$100 million affair with an emphasis on romance and kid-friendly relationships as opposed to the expensive web-slinging set pieces (and star salaries) that drove the budget of Sam Raimi's _Spider-Man 3_ to $260m.But they eventually decided to go big, which resulted in a $230m origin story that played like a buttoned-down remake of Sam Raimi's _Spider-Man_ and cost more than Raimi's first two pictures ($130m and $220m respectively) and almost as much as _Spider-Man 3_.

It also cost $10m more than _The Avengers_. Whatever Sony initially had planned for their new Spider-Man series, expanded-universe fever gripped Hollywood after _The Avengers_ scored$1.5 billion in worldwide grosses.Warner Bros. (a division of Time Warner) started fashioning a rebooted DC universe off their upcoming _Man Of Steel_, Fox started its own mini-expanded universe with the _X-Men_ films and the _Fantastic Four_ reboot, Walt Disney bought Lucasfilm with the hopes of turning _Star Wars_ into a multi-tiered film universe, and Sony decided to craft an entire universe out of a single comic book superhero. Thus two years later, we get _The Amazing Spider-Man 2_ which was sold as less a sequel to _The Amazing Spider-Man_ than a backdoor pilot for _Spider-Man vs. the Sinister Six._ With Sony being bashed for not having enough franchises ([unfairly, I have argued](http://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2014/02/26/sony-cant-survive-on-spider-man-alone/), as _22 Jump Street_ and _Think Like A Man Too_ will make them quite a bit of money),Sony Corporation's rebooted _Amazing Spider-Man_ franchise has become too big to fail.

Had Sony stuck with the original plan of a scaled-down superhero franchise, one that really was rooted in romantic drama, they would have at least stuck out in a crowded field of superhero franchises. When every superhero film is now going bigger, _Amazing Spider-Man_ could have distinguished itself by going small and intimate.They also would have saved a boatload of money, getting the same fans and general moviegoers who would surely have flocked to the Spider-Man franchise out of love for the character (the last film had no buzz and mixed reviews yet still debuted with $91 million) at a cost of around $100 million per film, which would make the last two films insanely profitable even if they performed no better.Heck, they could have swapped out Peter Parker for Miles Morales (the current half-black/half-Hispanic teen who took up the mantle in _Ultimate Spider-Man_ several years back), which would have made the series historically worthwhile and further separated it from the Raimi trilogy.

All of this adds up to why a likely $200m domestic total and $700m worldwide total for _The Amazing Spider-Man 2_ feels disappointing.Instead of standing out from the pack, _Amazing Spider-Man_ is now just another massively-expensive superhero franchise trying to pretzel itself into some kind of expanded universe. While Spider-Man was once the king of superhero franchises, it is now just another big-budget franchise fighting for a piece of the pie, trying to do variations of what everyone else is doing.The original concept of the reboot, a cheaper, small-scale teen romance with a few webby action beats, would have been at least different. But the first film cost $230 million and this one cost $255m, making this series the most expensive ongoing franchise at the moment and still leaving them both too similar to the original franchise and resembling the attention-starved younger sibling who also totally aced their spelling test too.

This was the price of rebooting Spider-Man instead of just going with _Spider-Man 4_ or sticking to their original _Spider-Man_ meets _Twilight_ idea.The original _Spider-Man_ franchise was a trendsetter, a gigantic and groundbreaking hit that had Hollywood desperately following in its footsteps.The cinematic adventures of Peter Parker were once trend-setters, but now they merely are followers, desperately trying to do what everyone else is doing but failing to establish itself as anything more than a pretender. That's the tragedy of _The Amazing Spider-Man_ and that's the price that Sony has paid for the reboot. Spider-Man was once not only spectacular but also superior. Now, in a world of _The Avengers_ and _The Dark Knight_, this new franchise comes across as _The Ordinary Spider-Man._
