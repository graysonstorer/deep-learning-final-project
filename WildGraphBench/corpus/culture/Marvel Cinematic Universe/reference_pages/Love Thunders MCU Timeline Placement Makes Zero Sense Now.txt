Thor: Love & Thunder has released on Disney+, apparently confirming its place in the MCU timeline - but unfortunately that doesn't work at all!

![Image 16: Thor Love and Thunder Broken Timeline](https://screenrant.com/love-thunder-mcu-timeline-no-sense/)

The place [_**Thor: Love & Thunder**_](https://screenrant.com/tag/thor-4/) has in the MCU timeline makes no sense. Marvel's commitment to a shared cinematic universe naturally means there needs to be a focus on continuity, at least as regards the basic sequencing of events. Phase 4, however, has hopped around the timeline with impunity, and consequently the MCU timeline is getting rather messy. Even some of the directors and showrunners don't seem quite certain how their films and TV shows fit into the overarching MCU timeline.

**SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY**

[_Thor: Love & Thunder_ director Taika Waititi](https://screenrant.com/thor-love-thunder-mcu-timeline-setting-taika-waititi/) addressed the timeline in one interview, suggesting the film was set some years after the events of [_Avengers: Endgame_](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers-4/). "_It's probably four years,_" he hazarded a guess, then added, "_Is that right?_" The Disney+ release of _Thor: Love & Thunder_ has provided a more definitive answer, placing Thor's latest adventure after _Ms. Marvel_, suggesting it is late 2025 (_Ms. Marvel_'s dating is quite precise, with background items confirming its exact placement in the MCU timeline).

Unfortunately, attentive viewers have noted the Disney+ timeline is deeply flawed. It contains numerous contradictions, and indeed on occasion Marvel has actually adjusted it, suggesting the studio recognized it is something of a work in progress. _Thor: Love & Thunder_ follows the same pattern, because its place in the [MCU Disney+ timeline](https://screenrant.com/disney-plus-mcu-timeline-break-explained/) makes no sense.

Love & Thunder Couldn't Be Set In Late 2025
-------------------------------------------

![Image 17: Thor and Jane Foster](https://screenrant.com/love-thunder-mcu-timeline-no-sense/)

The core problem is that _Thor: Love & Thunder_ cannot possibly be set in late 2025. In one key scene, Thor Odinson claimed he and Jane Foster had not seen one another since they broke up eight years, seven months, and six days ago. This remark is an important clue in terms of figuring out the timeline, because Thor and Jane broke up sometime between [_Avengers: Age of Ultron_](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers-2/) (summer 2015) and [_Captain America: Civil War_](https://screenrant.com/tag/captain-america-3/) (March-April 2016, with dialogue confirming Thor had been offworld for some time). This means the latest _Thor: Love & Thunder_ can actually take place is late 2024.

A further complication lies in [Groot's age, discussed by James Gunn](https://screenrant.com/james-gunn-groot-age-avengers-infinity-war/) ahead of [_Avengers: Infinity War_](https://screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers-3/). According to Gunn, Groot does not age at the same rate as a human (explaining his accelerated aging between [_Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_](https://screenrant.com/tag/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2/) and _Avengers: Infinity War_). Given Groot was last seen in _Avengers: Endgame_ (which ends in October 2023), he'd certainly have changed in appearance within the next two years. The fact he has not done so suggests this cannot be more than a few months after Thor left Earth with the Guardians of the Galaxy.

How The MCU Keeps Making the Timeline Worse
-------------------------------------------

![Image 18: She-Hulk writer explains MCU timeline efforts](https://screenrant.com/love-thunder-mcu-timeline-no-sense/)

In truth, the Disney+ MCU timeline has been broken since it was first released. Viewers were initially taken aback by the placement of _Thor: The Dark World_, which has been set before _Iron Man 3_. This actually works quite well in terms of overarching narrative, but unfortunately [broke the _Agents of SHIELD_ timeline](https://screenrant.com/mcu-timeline-agents-shield-extremis-thor-broken/). More serious issues occurred with the dating of _Black Widow_, initially placed after _Black Panther_ even though both films are explicitly dated with reference to the Sokovia Accords and should be set the other way round (Disney eventually corrected this). The positioning of _Shang-Chi & the Legends of the Ten Rings_ ignores the dating of Qingming, the Chinese festival associated with the opening of the gate to Ta-Lo. _Moon Knight_ fits best at a different place in the MCU timeline as well, with the creative team hinting its internal timeline in a tremendously appropriate way - through the phases of the moon.

The problem, of course, simply lies in the fact the MCU is telling its stories out of sequence. This habit began as a deliberate narrative choice in Phase 3, but it's become more notable in Phase 4. [The MCU's timeline](https://screenrant.com/mcu-chronological-timeline-order-explained-disney-wrong/) is now complicated by the sheer volume of Marvel films and TV shows currently in production, because even Marvel's key decision-makers don't really know quite what order things will be released; [_Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_](https://screenrant.com/tag/doctor-strange-2/) and _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ actually switched release order. [_She-Hulk: Attorney at Law_](https://screenrant.com/tag/she-hulk/) appears to be trying to fix Phase 4's timeline through various Easter eggs, and is doing a creditable job, but content continues to be made at the same hurried rate. All this means the MCU's continuity problems will no doubt continue to build, as the unfortunate placing of _**Thor: Love & Thunder**_ in the MCU timeline proves.
