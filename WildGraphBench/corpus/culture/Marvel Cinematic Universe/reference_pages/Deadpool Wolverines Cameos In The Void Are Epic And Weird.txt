# Deadpool & Wolverine's Cameos In The Void Are Epic And Weird

![Image 1: Spoiler Alert](blob:https://web.archive.org/ac309ce702f74d6df693fa4fb24f4be7)

We’ve always suspected that _[Deadpool & Wolverine](https://web.archive.org/web/20240726154420/https://www.marvel.com/movies/deadpool-3)_ was going to be a cameo-fest from Marvel movies past, especially those coming from Twentieth Century Fox. And we were totally right. Many Marvel characters from pre-MCU films appeared in the Multiversal trash heap world known as The Void. It is a place at the end of time where elements from obsolete timelines go to die. The [evil Cassandra Nova](https://web.archive.org/web/20240726154420/https://nerdist.com/article/who-is-marvel-comics-cassandra-nova-deadpool-and-wolverine-villain/), sister of Professor X, rules this Void, as a rag-tag group of forgotten heroes from past Marvel films oppose her. The movie refers to them mainly as “the Others.” But we could just as easily call them “the Avengers of the Void.” Here are the surprise heroes who made the cut for the MCU’s weirdest super team ever.

**Elektra (Jennifer Garner)**
-----------------------------

Jennifer Garner returned as Elektra Nachios, the ninja assassin she played in 2003’s _Daredevil_ and her own spin-off film, _Elektra._ Neither film became a hit with critics or fans. But we must confess, she was pretty awesome in _Deadpool & Wolverine_. She kicked the asses of Cassandra Nova’s goons with her twin sai swords, reminding us a bit of [the glory days of _Alias_](https://web.archive.org/web/20240726154420/https://nerdist.com/article/the-unsung-heroes-of-alias/). She also got the best laugh in the movie, with a joke at the expense of her former co-star/former husband Ben Affleck, who famously played Daredevil alongside her.

**Blade (Wesley Snipes)**
-------------------------

_New Line Cinema_

The man who truly proved Marvel heroes could work in movies made a very welcome return in _Deadpool & Wolverine_. Wesley Snipes once again played The Daywalker, Blade. The [half-human/half-vampire badass](https://web.archive.org/web/20240726154420/https://nerdist.com/article/marvel-comics-blade-comics-from-the-70s-should-inspire-mcu-movie/) was subject of the first successful Marvel film in 1998. _Blade_ helped kick off a cinematic revolution we’re still living in today. Snipes’ return was a bit of a shock, for several reasons. He allegedly did _not_ get along with co-star Ryan Reynolds in _Blade Trinity_. Not to mention, the _Blade_ films came from New Line Cinema, not Twentieth Century Fox, which Disney now owns. Thank goodness old grievances were let go, and Snipes could return to do what he does best.

**The Human Torch (Chris Evans)**
---------------------------------

_Twentieth Century Fox_

Audiences gasped when Captain America, the heart and soul of the MCU, returned in _Deadpool & Wolverine_. Except, it wasn’t actually Cap. Yes, _Deadpool & Wolverine_ marks the return of Chris Evans to the MCU, but he played his original Marvel role, that of Johnny Storm, [a.k.a. the Human Torch](https://web.archive.org/web/20240726154420/https://nerdist.com/article/bill-murray-played-the-human-torch-on-a-fantastic-four-radio-show-from-1975/) in _The Fantastic Four_. We’re not sure what became of the rest of his family in the Void (probably nothing good), but Johnny fought side by side with the Avengers of the Void—until Cassandra Nova ripped the flesh from his bones and killed him. But at least we got to see Evans shout “Flame On!” one last time. And also say a lot of curse words that would make Steve Rogers blush bright red.

**Gambit (Channing Tatum)**
---------------------------

_MGM/Marvel Comics_

Thought those cameos were shocking? How about an actor that never even got to play the Marvel role he coveted? Channing Tatum appears as the ragin’ Cajun X-Man known as Gambit, wearing his full Jim Lee-designed costume, made famous by _X-Men: The Animated Series_. Does the costume, and Tatum’s Cajun accent, all read as ridiculous in live-action? You bet. And that’s what made Tatum’s performance so delicious. This role was [a very long time coming for Tatum](https://web.archive.org/web/20240726154420/https://nerdist.com/article/channing-tatum-still-sad-about-gambit-movie-mcu/), a huge Gambit fan. He was first announced to play the card-throwing Remy LeBeau in 2014, for a solo film. It kept getting delayed and delayed, until Disney bought Fox, and killed the project. We’re glad Marvel Studios finally let Tatum play his dream role at last.

**X-23 (Dafne Keen)**
---------------------

_Marvel Studios_

The heart of this makeshift Avengers team, however, is Dafne Keen, who returns to the role of Laura Kinney/X-23. She’s the same [daughter of Wolverine](https://web.archive.org/web/20240726154420/https://nerdist.com/article/who-is-marvel-x-23-laura-kinney-from-logan-to-deadpool-wolverine/) she played in _Logan_, only now she’s a young woman and not a kid anymore. She fights just like her father Logan taught her, and helps the Wolverine in this film reconnect with the hero he once was. After all, her Logan sacrificed himself to save her, and many other mutant kids. She knows this Logan is made of the same stuff. Her moments with Logan in the film are fantastic, and we hope she finds a place on any future MCU X-Men team.
