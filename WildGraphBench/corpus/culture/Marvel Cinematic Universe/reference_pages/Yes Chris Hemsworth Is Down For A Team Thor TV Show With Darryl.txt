![Image 5: Team Thor Chris Hemsworth as Thor Daley Pearson as Darryl Jacobson Marvel MCU](https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cinemablend/media/img/missing-image.svg)

Paging [Disney+](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2470200/Disney-Is-Launching-In-November-And-The-Price-Is-Incredible): Please make [_Team Thor_](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1550259/new-hilarious-marvel-video-reveals-what-thor-and-hulk-were-doing-during-civil-war) your next new TV show announcement. Marvel Cinematic Universe star Chris Hemsworth has gone on the record to say he'd be up for a TV series continuing the story of Thor and his Australian roommate Darryl Jacobson (Daley Pearson). That odd couple storyline has played out through three fantastic _Team Thor_/_Darryl_ short films to date.

> I'd love to do that. I’d love to see Darryl more. I'd love to do a little mockumentary TV show of us living together and rooming together and our day-to-day adventures outside of saving the world, just sort of the regular stuff. I thought that was a lot of fun to shoot, and also I think it'd be cool to have a TV show like that yeah.

Chris Hemsworth even suggested some of the day-to-day adventures he and Darryl could have, after [MTV International](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pp96ajYDiRg&feature=youtu.be) asked about the TV show idea:

> Surfing, fishing, we’d go to a pub. It'd be good fun. I’d take him to Asgard, and we could explore that world.

By the powers of all the gods and sweet Rabbit himself, please make this happen!

All of the _Team Thor_ shorts were directed by [_Thor: Ragnarok_](https://www.cinemablend.com/reviews/1714619/thor-ragnarok-review) director Taika Waititi, who has already said he'd love to make more of these Thor/Darryl mockumentaries. The first _Team Thor_ also starred Mark Ruffalo's Bruce Banner/The Hulk as a way of explaining what Thor and the Hulk were doing while the other Avengers were busy fighting each other in _Captain America: Civil War_. Thor was shown visiting Australia, living with office worker Darryl and trying in his own Thor-ish way to live a normal life.

RECOMMENDED VIDEOS FOR YOU...

Team Thor was a huge hit with fans, and that led to _Team Thor: Part 2_, which continued the hilarity:

The party [continued with _Team Darryl_](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2313212/watch-thors-roommate-darryl-interact-with-grandmaster-in-hilarious-marvel-video), adding Jeff Goldblum's _Thor: Ragnarok_ Grandmaster to the mix as poor Darryl's latest roommate, since Thor was suddenly busy:

This could continue forever and not get old. It would also be great, as Chris Hemsworth suggested, to bring Darryl to Asgard. Thor and the Grandmaster were fish out of water on Earth and it would be interesting to see Darryl put through the paces in the rest of the universe.

If this TV series happened, it may need to be set before the events of _Avengers: Infinity Wa_ r and [_Avengers: Endgame_](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/1715399/avengers-4-what-we-know-so-far), or at least have _Endgame_ turn things around significantly so that it could make sense that Thor and Darryl are just hanging out again.

At least we know that Darryl did survive Thanos' Decimation, as Darryl actor Daley Pearson revealed on Twitter ... while Darryl was still working hard at the office:

Disney just announced a bunch of new content for the Disney+ streaming service, which [launches this November](https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2470200/Disney-Is-Launching-In-November-And-The-Price-Is-Incredible). If Chris Hemsworth and Taika Waititi are willing to commit to some _Team Thor_ episodes, The Mouse House should lock them in now and get the ball rolling. The shows clearly wouldn't have to be expensive to be amazing, since just Darryl and Thor writing an email together is classic.

For now, you know _Avengers: Endgame_ opens in theaters Friday, April 26. And Taika Waititi's mockumentary style show [_What We Do in the Shadows_](https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2466379/what-we-do-in-the-shadows-trailer-reveals-a-dark-and-hilarious-take-on-vampire-life), based on his hilarious movie, airs Wednesday nights on FX; it's one of many shows just starting up as [summer 2019 programming approaches](https://www.cinemablend.com/television/2469307/2019-summer-tv-and-streaming-schedule-premiere-dates-for-new-and-returning-shows).
