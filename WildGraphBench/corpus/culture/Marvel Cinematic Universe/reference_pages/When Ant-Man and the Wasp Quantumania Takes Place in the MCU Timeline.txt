When Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania Takes Place in the MCU Timeline
======================================================================

By[Robert Vaux](https://web.archive.org/web/20230220162453/https://www.cbr.com/author/robert-vaux/?_locale=en)

Published 18 hours ago

The new MCU blockbuster is surprisingly tricky to pin down, time-wise. Here's where Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania takes place in the timeline.

![Image 10: Kang, Ant-Man, and the Wasp with Chronopolis in the background from Quantumania](https://web.archive.org/web/20230220162453/https:/www.cbr.com/ant-man-wasp-quantumania-place-mcu-timeline-explained/)

**_The following contains spoilers for [Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania](https://web.archive.org/web/20230220162453/https://www.cbr.com/tag/ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania/), now playing in theaters._**

For every new installment in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, the question invariably arises as to when a given movie or TV series takes place in the universe's timeline. A franchise of this size and complexity requires considerable care in determining what happens when, and with both time travel and alternate universes now officially on the table, the timeline becomes exponentially more complex. _Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania_ muddies the waters by spending the vast majority of its running time in the Quantum Realm, where time has no meaning, and the characters could emerge seconds or decades after they enter.

**CBR VIDEO OF THE DAY**

All of this makes pinning down _Quantumania_'s spot in the timeline a bit of a challenge. There's no firm signpost beyond _Avengers: Endgame_, where [Scott Lang and the rest of the Avengers](https://web.archive.org/web/20230220162453/https://www.cbr.com/scott-lang-best-mcu-hero-avengers-endgame/) undid the effects of The Snap. It gets a little help from _Black Panther: Wakanda Forever_, which features Easter eggs covering Scott Lang. That sets the story somewhere in the MCU's 2025, alongside several Phase Four projects.

Scott Lang Has Been Busy Since Avengers: Endgame
------------------------------------------------

While Lang and the Ant Family haven't appeared onscreen in the MCU since the conclusion of _Endgame_, they haven't exactly been absent. _Ms. Marvel_ Season 1, Episode 1, "Generation Why" refers to [his podcast "Big Me, Little Me](https://web.archive.org/web/20230220162453/https://www.cbr.com/ms-marvel-bisha-k-ali-wants-real-ant-man-podcast-mcu/)," and Kamala Khan records a YouTube speculating on Lang and Hope van Dyne's romantic trip to Paris. That fits with the opening scenes of _Quantumania_, as Scott enjoys the limelight that comes with being an Avenger, and he and Hope settle into a romantic relationship.

"Generation Why" also features AvengerCon, which Kamala sneaks out of her house to attend, and which takes place in late May 2025. That means her YouTube video was likely posted earlier in the month, which could put the initial montage in _Quantumania_ at roughly the same time. It also tracks with the events of _Wakanda Forever_, which take place in 2025 as well and contains a specific [Easter egg related to Lang](https://web.archive.org/web/20230220162453/https://www.cbr.com/scott-lang-ant-man-3-scene-wakanda-forever-black-panther/).

_Quantumania_ opens with Lang writing a bestselling book called [_Look Out for the Little Guy_](https://web.archive.org/web/20230220162453/https://www.cbr.com/scott-lang-paul-rudd-ant-man-and-the-wasp-quantumania-real-autobiography/) about his experiences as a superhero. The book is mentioned in the banner of a fictional news report during _Wakanda Forever_, which means the new movie takes place concurrently with the _Black Panther_ sequel. [In an interview with CinemaBlend](https://web.archive.org/web/20230220162453/https://youtu.be/vtygMkXajh4?t=95) posted to YouTube, _Wakanda Forever_ producer Nate Moore confirmed that his film and _Quantumania_ take place at roughly the same time.

The Quantum Realm Makes Quantumania's Timeframe Harder to Determine
-------------------------------------------------------------------

![Image 11: Ant-Man Meets Kang in Quantumania](https://web.archive.org/web/20230220162453/https:/www.cbr.com/ant-man-wasp-quantumania-place-mcu-timeline-explained/)

The wild card in _Quantumania_'s timetable comes from the fact that almost all of it is spent [in the Quantum Realm](https://web.archive.org/web/20230220162453/https://www.cbr.com/ant-man-3-quantum-realm-basement-of-the-multiverse/), where time is meaningless and permits people like Kang to move to different universes and realities. That means that events taking place in _Quantumania_ could affect both the past and the future of the MCU. While the film could be compressed into the few ticks of the clock in the franchise's "normal" reality, it's largely unbound by time and, therefore, could take place whenever a given future project has narrative need.

That sounds unduly complicated, but considering [Kang's importance to Phase Five](https://web.archive.org/web/20230220162453/https://www.cbr.com/ant-man-3-quantumania-kang-threat-mcu/) -- and the kaleidoscope of realities he's likely to bring with him -- the caveat could be necessary. _Quantumania_'s space on the timeline requires only a few cross-references to confirm. But the can of worms it unleashes has the potential to take place anywhere on the timeline, while further trips to the Quantum Realm could take place before, during or after _Quantumania_ without creating continuity errors. In other words, all bets are off.

_To learn more about the Quantum Realm, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now playing in theaters._
