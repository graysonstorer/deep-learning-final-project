# Daredevil and Entire Defenders Saga Added to Official MCU Timeline on Disney+

What could mark a property as being MCU-canon official more than ending up on the Disney+ MCU timeline? Very little. That’s why it’s a pretty big deal that all of Netflix’s Marvel shows, also known as the Defenders Saga, are now officially embedded in the MCU canon timeline on Disney+. Yes, if you visit the “Timeline Order” playlist [on the Disney+ MCU page](https://www.disneyplus.com/brand/marvel), you can find _Daredevil_ next to _I am Groot_ and _The Punisher_ next to _Doctor Strange_. It all sends a pretty clear message. The Defenders Saga is now officially part of the MCU canon. We guess the MCU has just become nearly 200 hours longer.

**The Defenders Saga Joins the Official MCU Canon Line-Up**
-----------------------------------------------------------

Whether the Netflix Marvel shows were actually a part of the MCU’s canon timeline has been debated for a long time. Certain things, such as actors reprising their Netflix roles in Disney+ MCU series, hinted toward yes. But Marvel Studios’ overall caginess about giving a firm answer to the question seemed to point toward no.

Most recently, [Defenders footage appeared in an _Echo_ trailer, and a producer seemed to confirm that _Daredevil_, at least, was a part of the MCU canon](https://nerdist.com/article/netflix-daredevil-series-confirmed-as-part-of-mcu-sacred-timeline-by-echo-trailer-and-producers/). But still, the question of whether all the series in the saga had joined the MCU proper remained. It felt possible that only _Daredevil_ had become MCU canon, or that only certain aspects of the Netflix series would be carried over to the MCU. But the appearances of _all_ the Defenders series on the MCU’s timeline seem definitive. At last, the entire Netflix Marvel Defenders universe has become part of the MCU.
