Marvel comic book characters Ghost Rider and Hellstrom are the latest to be adapted into live-action TV series.

Marvel, apparently, doesn't really need Netflix.

The comic book powerhouse, fresh off a wave of high-profile cancellations at Netflix, has nabbed a pair of straight-to-series orders at Hulu —_Ghost Rider_ and _Helstrom,_ based on the comic book characters of the same name. Both series will debut on Hulu in 2020. They join fellow live-action drama _Runaways_ and a [slate of four animated comedies (and a special)](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/marvel-hulu-set-four-show-animated-slate-howard-duck-modok-hit-money-tigra-dazzler-1185246) at Hulu. The news comes as Hulu is now majority controlled by Marvel Television parent company Disney.

_Ghost Rider_ revolves around anti-hero Robbie Reyes, who, consumed by hellfire and supernaturally bound to a demon. Reyes lives on the Texas/Mexico border and when he unleashes the Rider, Robbie brings vengeance for the innocents he encounters, but struggles to control the power he wields._Ghost Rider_ will be executive produced by Ingrid Escajeda (_Justified_), who will serve as showrunner, Paul Zbyszewski (_Agents of SHIELD, Lost_) and Marvel TV boss Jeph Loeb.

_Helstrom,_ meanwhile, revolves around Daimon and Ana Helstrom, the son and daughter of a mysterious and powerful serial killer. The siblings have a complicated dynamic as they track down the terrorizing worst of humanity — each with their attitude and skills._Helstrom_ is executive produced by Zbyszewski, who will serve as showrunner, and Loeb. Both shows will exist in the same universe as Hulu builds its second interconnected Marvel universe as the two live-action dramas and animated slate are akin to the five-show universe Marvel previously had at Netflix.

The news comes after ABC's Marvel drama, _Agents of SHIELD_, featured the character of Ghost Rider/Robbie Reyes with [Gabriel Luna](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/agents-shield-ghost-rider-robbie-919806) previously portraying the character in season four. Luna will reprise his role in the Hulu drama. (Nicolas Cage also portrayed the Johnny Blaze iteration of the character in the 2007 feature _Ghost Rider_ and its 2012 sequel.)

Both series will be produced by Marvel Television and ABC Signature Studios.

All told, Hulu's Marvel slate now consists of season three of _Runaways, Ghost Rider, Helstrom_ and animated comedies _MODOK, Hit-Monkey, Tigra & Dazzler Show, Howard the Duck_ and team-up special _The Offenders_. (The latter title should be considered a dig at Netflix, whose live-action miniseries team-up was called _The Defenders_.)

The Hulu live-action Marvel slate comes on the heels of Netflix's decision to sever all ties with the comic book giant earlier this year when the streamer canceled _The Punisher_ and announced that the upcoming third season of _Jessica Jones_ would be its last. Those joined _Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Daredevil_ and mashup mini _The Defenders_ in the canceled heap. The decision was brought on after Netflix and Marvel's relationship soured.

With the Marvel orders, all of the company's scripted offerings now live on Disney-owned networks after Fox canceled _The Gifted_ a few weeks ago. Marvel's slate also includes Freeform's _Cloak and Dagger,_ the upcoming third and final season of _Legion_ on now Disney-owned FX as well as three live-action series for Disney's upcoming streaming platform, Disney+: _Loki,_ starring Tom Hiddleston; _WandaVision,_ with Paul Bettany and Elizabeth Olsen; _The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,_ with Anthony Mackie and Sebastian Stan; and animated series _What If_. The Disney+ series are all being overseen by Marvel's film division.

The Marvel series pickups were announced Wednesday during Hulu's upfront presentation in New York, where the streamer also announced renewals for comedies [_PEN15_ and](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/pen15-ramy-renewed-second-seasons-at-hulu-1206331)_[Ramy](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/pen15-ramy-renewed-second-seasons-at-hulu-1206331),_ and a series order for a [Nicole Kidman drama](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/nicole-kidman-drama-nine-perfect-strangers-big-little-lies-team-lands-at-hulu-1206234) from the author of _Big Little Lies_, among other [news](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/david-change-chrissy-teigen-vox-media-produce-food-shows-hulu-1206332) that included its impressive [growth](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/hulu-grows-28-million-subscribers-1206322).
