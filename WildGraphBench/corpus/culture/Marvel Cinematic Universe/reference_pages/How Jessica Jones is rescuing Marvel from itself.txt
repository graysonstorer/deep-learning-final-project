When the first "Iron Man"came out seven years ago, I shoveled popcorn in my mouth, loving Robert Downey Jr.'s top-shelf snark as much as anyone. But last summer, I sat in a theater watching "[Avengers: Age of Ultron](http://www.cnet.com/news/avengers-age-of-ultron-is-peak-marvel-spoiler-free-review/)," and I was bored. Since Iron Man's triumphant debut, [almost every movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe](http://www.cnet.com/how-to/marvel-cinematic-universe-timeline-avengers/), with the notable exception of "Guardians of the Galaxy," has begun to feel like a giant, two-hour set-piece. Even the Netflix Original "Daredevil" disappointed, aiming for realism but falling back into bad comic-book writing.

Then "[Jessica Jones](http://www.cnet.com/news/jessica-jones-review-private-eye-superhero-horror-story/)" came out, and I was distinctly not bored. When the final credits rolled (only 48 hours after I clicked "play" on the first episode), I thought, "That wasn't a good super-hero flick. That was a damn good show!"

Here's how "Jessica Jones" is saving Marvel from itself:

**It explores a new story.** A superstrong woman faces off versus a mind-controlling baddie (who's creepy as hell, to boot). Don't be misled by the plot description: "Jessica Jones" tells a very real story of abuse, rape and survivor's guilt, all under the guise of a straight super-hero story. The action's great, but it never eclipses the story.

**It plays off a new (to the MCU) genre.**Before we ever see super powers on display, we follow Jessica Jones, slinking through the streets of New York City and snapping photos of cheaters for suspicious spouses -- all the while accompanied by a soundtrack of lone warbling horns and _tap-tapping_ cymbals. [This is textbook neo-noir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo-noir). But show runner S.J. Clarkson replaces the always-male detective of noir with the female title character. The femme fatale archetype is divided between characters who each cleverly fulfill and invert the role -- the blonde is not a lover but a best friend, and the aloof love interest is a buff black guy.

**It uses new characters.** No Oscar-winning women are relegated to sidekick status (I'm looking at you, "Iron Man" and "Thor"). There's no Scarlett Johansson amidst a sea of mostly white men. For the first time in the MCU, we get multiple compelling female characters, give them the spotlight, and let them develop -- all reflective of a more diverse group of creative production leaders.

Marvel still has a long way to go, and I'm disappointed that Marvel Studios has stated no plans for any leading women of color in the MCU (although, as a reader pointed out, shows like "Marvel's Agents of Shield" and "Daredevil" have both included non-white female characters). But "Jessica Jones" takes big steps forward in terms of theme, craft and diversity. It's a good story first, and a superhero show second. And for the first time, the MCU seems like it matters. Our culture _needs_ stories like this. Here's hoping Marvel keeps them coming.
