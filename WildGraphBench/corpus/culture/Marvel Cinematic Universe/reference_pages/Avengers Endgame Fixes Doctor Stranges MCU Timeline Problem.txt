![Image 3: The image shows an archive team going to rescue your shit, and contains two plastic crates filled with old CD-ROMs, as well as a cabinet of old-fashioned cassette tapes](http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg) Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history. 
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at [archiveteam.org](http://www.archiveteam.org/) and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php), providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

**The Archive Team Panic Downloads** are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

Avengers: Endgame Fixes Doctor Strange’s MCU Timeline Problem
=============================================================

Doctor Strange has always been difficult to place in the MCU timeline - but Avengers: Endgame has finally explained how the Sorcerer Supreme fits.

[**_Avengers: Endgame_**](https://web.archive.org/web/20201108030720/https://screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers-4/) has finally explained how the events of[_Doctor Strange_](https://web.archive.org/web/20201108030720/https://screenrant.com/tag/doctor-strange/) fit into the Marvel timeline. The MCU's chronology just about works, but the Devil has always been in the details; dig a little too much, and the shared cinematic universe has a number of timeline problems. Some are glaring, such as the infamous, ["_very incorrect_" Eight Years Later](https://web.archive.org/web/20201108030720/https://screenrant.com/avengers-spider-man-homecoming-time-jump-director/) in[_Spider-Man: Homecoming_](https://web.archive.org/web/20201108030720/https://screenrant.com/tag/spider-man-homecoming-2/), but others are more subtle.

_Doctor Strange_ has always been difficult to place in the MCU timeline. It's one of the most self-contained movies in the entire MCU, with only a brief glimpse of Avengers Tower to fix it in relation to the rest of the Marvel blockbusters. According to director Scott Derrickson, the events of _Doctor Strange_ span about a year - but which year? Some have suggested 2015 through to 2016, meaning the film would end roughly around the time of its release; some argue for 2013 through to 2014, based on a throwaway mention of Doctor Strange in[_Captain America: The Winter Soldier_](https://web.archive.org/web/20201108030720/https://screenrant.com/tag/captain-america-2/); and there have even been claims[it could be set in 2020 through to 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20201108030720/https://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-mcu-timeline-year/)based on dates briefly shown on-screen.

Thankfully,_Avengers: Endgame_ finally locks _Doctor Strange_ down. In one scene [set during the events of _The Avengers_ in 2012](https://web.archive.org/web/20201108030720/https://screenrant.com/avengers-endgame-marvel-movies-visited-time-travel/), the Hulk visits the Sanctum Sanctorum and confronts the Ancient One. He attempts to barge past her, telling the then-present Sorcerer Supreme that he's come looking for Stephen Strange. Needless to say, she's rather amused, and tells Bruce that he's "_about five years too early._" Per the events of _Doctor Strange_, the Ancient One has been using the Time Stone to peer into the future, and while she couldn't see beyond the moment of her death, she'd spotted Stephen and knew when he was destined to become a sorcerer. The events of _Doctor Strange_ are thus pinned down as running from 2016 through to 2017, fitting perfectly with awards on Strange's wall at the start of the film that carry a 2016 date.

This subtle detail carries important implications for the MCU. It means that Doctor Strange is actually a relatively new practitioner of the Mystic Arts. It's true that Strange is a prodigious student, with a photographic memory that's well-suited to spellcraft; what's more, he also spent an indeterminate period of time in the [Dark Dimension fighting Dormammu](https://web.archive.org/web/20201108030720/https://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-dark-dimension-dormammu-powers/), apparently gaining mastery of his powers. But in terms of real application, he's not had a long time with them due to the restrictions placed on his battle by the Time Stone.That neatly explains why Strange hadn't foreseen the Black Order's arrival on Earth in[_Avengers: Infinity War_](https://web.archive.org/web/20201108030720/https://screenrant.com/tag/the-avengers-3/), and perhaps even why he didn't use what Thanos considered his "_greatest weapon_" against the Mad Titan. He may simply not have known how to.

From an out-of-universe perspective, the Ancient One's line also feels like an amusing meta-joke. The first mention of Doctor Strange in the MCU was in _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_, when he was named as a Hydra priority target. It [never really fit with the MCU's canon](https://web.archive.org/web/20201108030720/https://screenrant.com/winter-soldier-doctor-strange-tease-mcu-canon/), given at the time Stephen Strange was nothing more than a celebrated surgeon. Like the Hulk in _Avengers: Endgame_,the reference was just a few years too early.
