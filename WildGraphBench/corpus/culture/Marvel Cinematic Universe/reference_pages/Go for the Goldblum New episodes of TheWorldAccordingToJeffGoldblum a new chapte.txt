Hii!! Could you please help make my dream come true and get Marvel & Kevin Feige (

) to cast me as a young teenage Clint Barton for flashbacks for Hawkeye season 2. It’s my dream. Thank you so much!!

as always, you left off titles. Marvel One-Shot: Item 47 Marvel One Shot: A Funny Thing Happened on the Way To Thor's Hammer this makes me sad. can you delete and re-add? It's positively BONKERS that you make a mistake every week.
