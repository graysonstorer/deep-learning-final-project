Disney Treasure Sets Sail with Worlds of Marvel Restaurant
==========================================================

Find Marvel Super Hero Academy onboard the newest Disney Cruise Line ship for little Super Heroes, too!

![Image 34: worlds of marvel](https://cdn.marvel.com/content/1x/worlds_of_marvel_2.jpg)

Ahoy, Avengers! Disney Cruise line will set sail with a brand new ship in the fleet, the [Disney Treasure](http://disneycruise.com/treasure), in late 2024 and onboard guests will find the spirit of adventure and some heroic Marvel heroes.

First [seen on the Disney Wish](https://www.marvel.com/articles/culture-lifestyle/first-look-at-worlds-of-marvel-on-the-disney-wish), Worlds of Marvel will be onboard the Disney Treasure as part of the rotational dining system. The immersive Marvel-themed dining experience celebrates favorite Avengers characters and stories, including an amazing interaction with everyone’s favorite webs-slinger, Spider-Man. This high-tech venue aboard the Disney Treasure will offer [a worldly menu](https://www.marvel.com/amp/articles/culture-lifestyle/worlds-of-marvel-food-onboard-disney-wish) and unique entertainment, including two separate nights with distinct shows and dining, all inspired by the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

![Image 35: super hero academy](https://cdn.marvel.com/content/1x/marvel_super_hero_academy.jpg)

But that’s not on the Marvel onboard! Additionally, Marvel Super Hero Academy takes to the high seas where young Super Heroes will train alongside the likes of Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Ant-Man.

More information about the Marvel experiences onboard the Disney Treasure will be available at a later date —but this is all Nick Fury has declassified for now.

_The Disney Treasure, the sister ship to the Disney Wish that launched in 2022, will embark on its maiden voyage, a seven-night Eastern Caribbean cruise from Port Canaveral, Florida, on Dec. 21, 2024, followed by an inaugural season of seven-night itineraries to the Eastern and Western Caribbean from Port Canaveral. Disney Cruise Line Castaway Club members can book a Disney Treasure cruise as early as Sept. 12, 2023, and bookings will open to all guests on Sept. 20, 2023._

**_To learn more about Disney Cruise Line or to book a cruise on the Disney Treasure, guests can visit disneycruise.com/treasure, call Disney Cruise Line at 888-325-2500 or contact their travel agent._**
