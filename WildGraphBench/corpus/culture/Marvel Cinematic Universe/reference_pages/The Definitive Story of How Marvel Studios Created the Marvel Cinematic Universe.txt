The Story of Marvel Studios: The Making of the Marvel Cinematic Universe - Back Slipcase

**_The Story of Marvel Studios_** is the first-ever, fully authorized, all-access history of Marvel Studios’ creation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, as told by the producers, writers, directors, concept artists, VFX artists, cast, and crew who brought it to life. Year-by-year, project-by-project, the studio’s founding and meteoric growth are described through detailed personal stories, anecdotes, and remembrances of noteworthy challenges, breakthrough milestones, and history-making successes.

Together, these stories reveal how each of the films evolved into one ongoing cinematic narrative, as coauthors [**Tara Bennett**](https://twitter.com/TaraDBennett) and [**Paul Terry**](https://twitter.com/Cellarscape)chart the complete production history of _The Infinity Saga_’s 23 movies (from 2008’s [_Iron Man_](https://www.marvel.com/movies/iron-man) all the way up to, and including, 2019’s [_Avengers: Endgame_](https://www.marvel.com/movies/avengers-endgame) and [_Spider-Man: Far From Home_](https://www.marvel.com/movies/spider-man-far-from-home)). Bennett and Terry were granted unprecedented access to Marvel Studios, which led to this years-in-the-making tome containing personal stories from more than 200 interviews, including every Marvel Studios producer; MCU writers and directors; the stars of _The Infinity Saga_; concept artists, costume designers, composers, and the talents behind the MCU’s dazzling visual effects; and more. Featuring previously unpublished behind-the-scenes photography and archival production material, as well as personal photos and memorabilia from cast and crew, _The Story of Marvel Studios_ is the essential, collectible chronicle of how the Marvel Cinematic Universe was brought to life.
