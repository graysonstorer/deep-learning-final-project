Marvel

A portion of Marvel’s big Hall H [Comic-Con](http://deadline.com/tag/comic-con/) panel this evening went to _[Thor: Ragnarok](http://deadline.com/tag/thor-ragnarok/)_. The cast of the threequel showed off the official trailer.

[Related](http://deadline.com/2017/07/captain-marvel-nick-fury-samuel-l-jackson-to-return-1202124578/ "Related Article")

[Samuel L. Jackson Confirmed As Nick Fury In 'Captain Marvel' & He'll Look Different: Pic Is Set In The 1990s](http://deadline.com/2017/07/captain-marvel-nick-fury-samuel-l-jackson-to-return-1202124578/ "Related Article")

The footage began showing Thor strapped into a chair arriving via tunnel a la a Disney ride to Sakaar, the fighting world of Jeff Goldblum’s Grandmaster. This is the part in the first trailer where Grandmaster asks “What have you brought me today?”

Thor is dumped in a hallway where he meets a rock being with an Australian accent. Within a moment he’s fighting The Hulk in Grandmaster’s stadium, but later on we see that they’re friends with the green giant remembering who Thor was.

Both Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) on the panel gave some insight into what _Ragnarok_ is about. At the end of _Dark World_, Loki finds himself on the throne of Asgaard.

“It’s been four years since the end of film and when Thor returns it’s a very different Asgaard,” says Hiddleston. “The kingdom is in shambles given Loki’s questionable alliances, particularly with Ragnarok.”

Said Ruffalo: “Hulk refuses to turn back into Banner and he’s enjoying his time on Sakaar as a gladiator champion.”

The new pic, helmed by New Zealand-born Taika Waititi, sees Chris Hemsworth’s Thor imprisoned on the other side of the universe without his mighty hammer and in a race against time to get back to Asgard and stop Ragnarok — the destruction of his homeworld and the end of Asgardian civilization — at the hands of Hela (newcomer Cate Blanchett), the goddess of death. Hiddleston, Idris Elba and Anthony Hopkins are also back from past pics, while newcomers include Tessa Thompson (Valkyrie) and Goldblum.

Like _Thor: The Dark World_, Disney will release _Thor: Ragnarok_ in the first week of November, setting a November 3 domestic release. It begins its international rollout October 25.

The third installment in the franchise is the first since 2013’s _Dark World_, which made $644.6 million globally. The first sequel wielded an even bigger box office hammer than 2011’s _Thor_, the first pic in the series revolving around the Norse god, which made $449.3M.

A new poster was also unveiled tonight:

1.   Kevin Tran • 3 hours ago  OMG!! Hulk finally talks. This is going to be awesome come November 3rd. [Reply](http://deadline.com/2017/07/thor-ragnarok-trailer-the-hulk-video-1202134136/?replytocom=1934581#respond)    
2.   BD • 2 hours ago  So first they bring in Hulk, and now they basically decided to give this film a Guardians of the Galaxy look to see if they can finally bring people in to see Thor after two very underwhelming films. They copied EVERYTHING from the look of those films.

Also, where’s Thor in that poster? I can’t see him. [Reply](http://deadline.com/2017/07/thor-ragnarok-trailer-the-hulk-video-1202134136/?replytocom=1934603#respond)
