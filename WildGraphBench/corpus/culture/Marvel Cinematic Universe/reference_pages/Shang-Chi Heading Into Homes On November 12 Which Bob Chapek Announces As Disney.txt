Disney

[Disney](https://deadline.com/tag/disney/) CEO [Bob Chapek](https://deadline.com/tag/bob-chapek/) mentioned today during a Goldman Sachs 30th Annual Communacopia Conference that _Shang-Chi and the Legend of Ten Rings_ will hit Disney+ on Friday, Nov. 12, which the studio is designating as [Disney+ Day](https://deadline.com/tag/disney-day/).

That’s a consumer day celebrating the services. “We’ll be surprising people with offers and it will be an annual thing,” said Chapek. “We’re going to have new content release against one of our four key franchises.”

This mirrors a similar even that Netflix is doing this week. You can read below what else is dropping on that day.

Chapek acknowledged during the conference, “We love theatrical exhibition,” those remarks coming from the CEO of a studio that has experimented with controversial distribution models during the pandemic while keeping the latest Marvel movie purely on a theatrical window yielding over $305M WW.

What he’s learned with these various day-and-date theatrical-PVOD Disney+ distribution channels? “What we’ve locked in is flexibility, being a consumer-first organization,” says Chapek.

“Some of our movies will have short windows,” he said pointing to Disney Animation’s upcoming Thanksgiving release _Encanto_ which will go on the service after 30 days of theatrical in time for Christmas. Chapek doesn’t believe it’s a means of cutting income, rather capturing the majority of people who’ll see it in a movie theater first, then providing an extra boost on the service over the year-end holidays.

Outside _Shang-Chi,_ here’s what else is dropping on Disney+ Day:

—_[Jungle Cruise](https://deadline.com/tag/jungle-cruise/)_ will become available for free on the service to subs

—the new Disney+ Original movie _Home Sweet Home Alone,_ a reimagining of the popular holiday franchise will debut

–a n all-new original series of shorts from Walt Disney Animation Studios called _Olaf Presents,_ which sees _Frozen_’s snowman retelling several classic Disney tales as only he can.

—domestic Disney+ streaming debut of fan favorite shorts from Walt Disney Animation Studios including _Frozen Fever,_ Oscar-winning shorts _Feast_ and _Paperman_, Oscar-nominated Mickey Mouse short, _Get A Horse!_ and more. There’s also the animated short film _Ciao Alberto_ from Pixar which features characters from their feature pic _Luca._

–A new short from _The Simpsons_ that pays tribute to Disney+’s marquee brands

— first five episodes from season 2 of _The World According to Jeff Goldblum_ from National Geographic

—A special celebrating the origins and legacy of _Star Wars_’ legendary bounty hunter, Boba Fett

–A special celebrating the Marvel Cinematic Universe on Disney+ with an exciting look towards the future.

—_Dopesick,_ an original series starring Michael Keaton, which will be released in international markets as part of the Star general entertainment content offering.

“The inaugural Disney+ Day will be a grand-scale celebration of our subscribers across the entire company,” said Chapek in a statement that followed the conference about the 2nd anniversary of Disney+. “This day of appreciation brings to life our mission to entertain, inform, and inspire fans and families around the globe through the power of unparalleled storytelling, and will become an annual tentpole event to be amplified across our global businesses.”

Also, in honor of Disney+ Day, Disney+ will make its debut in South Korea and Taiwan on Nov. 12, and in Hong Kong on Nov. 16.

**Opt Out of Advertising Cookies**

 PMC and our advertising partners use cookies and other technologies to collect and share certain information such as your usage activity to deliver ads that are more relevant to you on PMC and other sites or apps. This may be considered a "sale” under the CCPA. You can opt out of this type of sharing by us using the toggle above. When the toggle is enabled, targeted advertising cookies are on. This opt out does not affect other cookies such as strictly necessary or essential cookies. For more information about cookies please see our [Privacy Policy](https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#california).

 You must exercise this choice every PMC site and on each device and browser where you want your choice to apply. If you clear cookies, you must opt out again. You may still receive ads from us (including contextual or based on our own data about you). We will still share some information with those of our partners who function as our service providers, such as to help us measure ad effectiveness, control the frequency, delivery and security of ads, and conduct analytics. This will not opt you out of the use of previously collected and shared information or all interest-based advertising (such as that conducted on other sites). 

 You can also update your browser settings or visit www.aboutads.info/choices to opt-out of certain uses of cookies for advertising purposes. 

 Our downstream partners who are not service providers may re-sell this information. You can request to opt out of such activity by clicking [here](https://www.iabprivacy.com/optout.html) to see a list of participants in the IAB (some of which are our partners) and submitting an opt out request on each entity’s site. Even if you opt out through this link, you will still see ads.
