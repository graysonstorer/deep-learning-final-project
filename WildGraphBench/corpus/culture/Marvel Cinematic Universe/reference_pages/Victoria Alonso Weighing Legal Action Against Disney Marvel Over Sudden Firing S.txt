Victoria Alonso

The Walt [Disney](https://deadline.com/tag/disney/) Company is facing “serious consequences” and possible legal action over the pink slipping[this week](https://deadline.com/2023/03/victoria-alonso-marvel-studios-departure-1235304993/) of Marvel VFX chief [Victoria Alonso](https://deadline.com/tag/victoria-alonso/).

Making it clear to [Bob Iger](https://deadline.com/tag/bob-iger/), [Kevin Feige](https://deadline.com/tag/kevin-feige/) and everyone at the House of Mouse that she is not going quietly the Oscar nominated producer has retained the services of Patty Glaser. To that end, with competing POVs on what was going on BTS, the Glaser Weil Fink Howard Avchen & Shapiro LLP partner is putting Disney on notice.

In a statement released Friday for the now former President, Physical and Postproduction, VFX and Animation Production for [Marvel Studios](https://deadline.com/tag/marvel-studios/), the litigator, who is already taking Disney-owned LucasFilm[to court](https://deadline.com/2023/03/star-wars-series-the-acolyte-lawsuit-lucasfilm-karyn-mccarthy-1235282595/) for the canning of _Star Wars_ TV series _[The Acolyte](https://deadline.com/tag/the-acolyte/)_ EP Karyn McCarthy, said:

The idea that Victoria was fired over a handful of press interviews relating to a personal passion project about human rights and democracy that was nominated for an Oscar and which she got Disney’s blessing to work on is absolutely ridiculous. Victoria, a gay Latina who had the courage to criticize Disney, was silenced. Then she was terminated when she refused to do something she believed was reprehensible.Disney and Marvel made a really poor decision that will have serious consequences. There is a lot more to this story and Victoria will be telling it shortly—in one forum or another.

Disney isn’t taking that shot across the bow without a missive of their own.

“It’s unfortunate that Victoria is sharing a narrative that leaves out several key factors concerning her departure, including an indisputable breach of contract and a direct violation of company policy,” a Disney spokesperson told Deadline this evening. “We will continue to wish her the best for the future and thank her for her numerous contributions to the studio.”

Alonso still has her _Possibility Is Your Superpower_ memoir coming out later this year on Disney imprint.

The very press-friendly Alonso, who was consistently an outspoken champion of diversity at Disney to the point where she called out then-Disney CEO Bob Chapek to “take a stand” against Florida’s anti-LGBTQ+ legislation‘Don’t Say Gay’ bill, abruptly departed earlier this week from Marvel Studios after a near two-decade run.

“So I ask you again Mr. Chapek: please respect—if we’re selling family—take a stand against all of these crazy outdated laws,” Alonso told a [GLAAD](https://deadline.com/tag/glaad/) audience over the clear discrimination move in the Sunshine State a.k.a home of DisneyWorld. “Take a stand for family. Stop saying that you tolerate us …We deserve the right to live, love, and have. More importantly, we deserve an origin story.”

We hear after her remarks at GLAAD last April over Disney’s mishandling of Florida’s Don’t Say Gay legislation, Alonso was benched by executives and told that she could no longer do interviews or media at all. Alonso was even asked late last year by a prominent director to speak out for a Marvel film, but she stayed mute. Then the self-described “reprehensible” incident occurred, which seemed to involve a disagreement with a Disney executive, who is not Iger, we’ve learned.

However, with that we hear that the Buenos Aires-born Alonso did not initially seek permission to produce the Academy Award nominated _Argentina, 1985_, but did see her contract re-drafted out of respect for her years at the company. The sticking point was the Alonso was distinctly not supposed to promote the political drama, which she did. That was the breaking point, an insider says.

As for Alonso being told to stay away from the press, there are more than a handful of media clippings from June last year announcing her memoir and with quotes from the then exec.

In what is certain to become ever sharper elbows if this goes to court, Deadline has been told that despite her affable demeanor to the press, Alonso was sometimes challenging to work with at the House of Mouse.

The punishing schedule aside, one insider cited how Alonso would take days off to conduct her own personal business affairs (read, producing the _Argentina 1985_ Oscar nominated film), and this ultimately resulted to some degree in a logjam of Marvel films and TV series in the post-production pipeline causing major theatrical release date delays. While many studios suffered delays in post-production houses due to the pandemic, Disney on several occasions postponed its bigger movies, i.e. _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_,_Thor Love & Thunder_, _Black Panther Wakanda Forever_ and _Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantumania_ and most recently _The Marvels._ In the new-cost cutting, job-cutting Iger 2.0 era, count VFX expenses—which was chiefly under Alonso’s domain–as one of those line items that needs to be reigned in.

Whether or not that meant showing the door to Alonso is a whole other matter, likely heading towards a pay out or a trial at this rate.

The hiring of Hollywood heavyweight litigator Glaser was first reported by _Variety_.

*    Anonymous  on March 25, 2023 12:10 pm  Almost impossible to prove there was any specific reason for a termination. If her products weren’t producing enough income, maybe it’s fair to say Disney needed to make a change. A lot of recent movies and shows were not getting a lot of viewership and she had a large role in production. If she felt there was a breach of contract, than do be it. Regardless her movies and shows, were rather disappointing, which probably contributed to record losses for Disney.

    *    Anonymous  on March 25, 2023 2:01 pm  *so be it

Did not see grammar mistake earlier. Also I would be curious if Ms. Alonso filed with the EEOC if she felt there was some issues concerning discrimination. On that note, if there is evidence of animus, disparate treatment then I’m sure that will be addressed in mediation. However, the reality of it is unless there’s no physical evidence i.e. a text mentioning her supervisor was upset due to a comment or that effect; then it would be difficult to prove that. Should be interesting to see how it develops. Let’s see if her lawyer can establish that her case has merit and if Disney acted within the letter of the law.

*    Anonymous  on March 25, 2023 10:01 am  This is LOL and delusional. Disney was already cutting a bunch of waste – scrap from the bottom and top – cheers on them. Victoria wanted all massive budget films to have a lot of content that had nothing to do with the story and was off-putting. In baseball terms, however, this is just a single hit. If Disney wants a home run, do Kathleen Kennedy next.

~ side note, her termination was already put thru the lawyer review pipeline, they knew what her response would be, they still did it. [Reply Reply to](https://deadline.com/2023/03/disney-lawsuit-threat-victoria-alonso-firing-marvel-patty-glaser-1235309916/?replytocom=3684688#respond)

If you’re annoyed that Victoria Alonso looks like a victim here, maybe you should put down your pitchfork and stop attacking her.

*    Kramer  on March 25, 2023 6:28 am  Alonso was one of the eight producers of the international production that was distributed by Amazon. Disney claims her involvement with the film at this level was a breach of contract – something which occurred multiple times. It’s already been reported that Alonso was warned repeatedly about her involvement with the production and its release, but her appearance at the Oscars last weekend on behalf of the film was the straw that broke the camel’s back. I get it is a passion project. But if she signed a deal saying she can’t produce work with another studio or promote those projects, then she can’t work with another studio. Everything else is noise. Am I missing something? What’s her legal angle here?

    *    Hux Stable  on March 25, 2023 10:45 am  There is no way that Disney realized she was involved in the project just a couple of weeks ago – the movie premiered at the Venice film festival last september! This is pure PR BS from the House of Mouse. It is kind of obvious they allowed her to participate and then used it as an excuse to make some noise. Alonso is a pawn sacrifice – Disney is trying to fix the whole De Santis situation in Florida. This is not about a local language film from South America, it is all about big bucks in Orlando and Disney courting the far right.

*    Anonymous  on March 24, 2023 11:27 pm  There is more to this than meets the eye or the stated reasons for Ms Alonso’s removal. Her Superpower at Marvel was finishing pictures with good Vfx and production values. From what I hear she had been checked out since End Game dealing with personal issues and her own aspirations. But kudos to her for her mighty run which helped make Marvel the most successful outfit in the history of Hollywood. No one could have kept up the ever expanding output as that triad did. And she will undoubtedly bounce back.

They were the ones that promised an exclusive theatrical release, not the hybrid streaming thing they went with. Then, they said very negative things about her in the press. They could have settled this long before the movie was released, with a payout like they did with other actors/directors/producers who had films released to streaming.

    *    Me  on March 24, 2023 10:03 pm  Or the people who are setting the schedules and budgets. With as many projects as they were trying to push through there was no way the VFX could be as good as people wanted. I doubt she had that much control over the schedule or budget for the VFX. Hell, one of the first thing Feige said was that Disney had been pushing too many projects through the pipeline in too short a time which was hurting the quality. That sounds like a clear recognition that this problem with the VFX wasn’t with Alonso but with the schedule.

*    my thoughts  on March 24, 2023 6:12 pm  Disney and other companies want to represent diversity… but not when it comes to LGTBQ visibility. Marvel’s brand is starting to lose its luster because audiences simply are growing tired of super hero movies. We live in dark times, and we know superheros arent going to save us. They’ve grown old. Blaming Victoria seems more like they are trying to put the blame on someone. Stop making super hero films and tv shows instead. LGTBQ people shouldn’t be silenced. So many are afraid in the industry of speaking of the inequalities, Victoria was brave to stand up for human rights when she asked her CEO to take a stand. Progress isn’t pretty, it requires brave people who sometimes wind up in the eye of the storm as a result. I have no direct knowledge, but from the outside it seems like its a little less black and white then we originally thought and there are other things going on here. Disney silencing her from doing press is pretty bad…think if it was someone else speaking up for equal rights. John Boyaga had the courage to do so and we rightfully applauded him for sharing his honest feelings, even if it pushed his employer Disney to consider their positions deeper.

Marvel was pushing too much through the pipeline and it was hurting the production from the bad VFX to the poor storylines. It also a problem over at DC.

RULE # 1 of IP – you don’t have to educate the public about IP because they are already familiar with it. It makes it easier to sell the product that has a track record, that’s why IP has value – if you take the IP and rework it into something not recognizable, it has no value.

This attitude that new writers (with little experience or poor previous projects) are somehow better then the original creators of an IP is why everything is garbage. Instead of riding on the coat tails of established IP only to rework it into some new crap, why not create something fresh with those ideas already worked into the concept instead the bait and switch that we currently have?
