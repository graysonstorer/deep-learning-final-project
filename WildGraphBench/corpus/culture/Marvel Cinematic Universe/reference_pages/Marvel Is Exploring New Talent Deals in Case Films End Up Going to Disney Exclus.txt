Marvel Studios Open House

Marvel Studios is beginning to explore new talent deals to provide flexibility in case the pandemic or other factors lead the studio to bypass theaters and take films straight to Disney+, TheWrap has learned.

Under the new contract language, key above-the-line talent like actors, writers, directors and producers will receive adjusted compensation depending on whether the film opens in theaters or debuts on the Disney+ streaming service, according to an insider with knowledge of the situation. Marvel blockbusters typically pay backend bonuses to key talent based on a film’s box office performance, which can be substantial for MCU films.

The new contract terms only affect Marvel movies that are about to enter production, starting with “Black Panther 2,” which is set to begin filming in June 2021, the insider said.

A rep for Marvel declined to comment for this story.

It’s unclear if the new contracts will also apply to Disney’s non-Marvel projects or whether deals are being renegotiated for completed movies like “Black Widow” starring Scarlett Johansson, which is still aiming for a May 2021 opening in theaters. One insider indicated that the studio was pursuing side-letter deals with top talent on films that had already wrapped production. CAA, which represents Johansson, declined to comment when asked if the actress has such a deal in place. A Disney rep also had no comment.

Studio insiders make it clear that everyone involved would prefer to release Marvel films exclusively in theaters since the traditional distribution has proved the most profitable for both studio and top talent over the years. The MCU series has emerged as the highest-grossing film franchise, with worldwide box office revenues of $22.6 billion.

But the pandemic has upended exhibition as movie theaters have shut down or limited capacity as millions of people choose to stay home rather than risk infection. And with the likelihood it may be more than halfway through 2021 before the COVID-19 vaccine is widely distributed in the U.S., studios have been forced to make contingency plans.

According to two insiders, Marvel started looking into the possibility of updating talent contracts before Warner Bros.’ seismic announcement that it will release all 17 of its 2021 releases in theaters and on HBO Max simultaneously — a move that’s expected to depress box office revenues (and the backed deals for top talent).

[Marvel Studios](https://www.marvel.com/movies) has a busy slate in the upcoming year with Scarlett Johannsson’s “Black Widow” due to arrive in theaters on May 7, 2021, “Shang Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings” will open on July 9, 2021, “Eternals,” directed by Chloé Zhao, will now open Nov. 5, 2021, and the third installment of the the Tom Holland “Spider-Man” franchise, “Untitled Tom Holland Spider-Man 3, is due Dec. 17, 2021.

People Are Really Weirded Out by Jim Caviezel’s ‘Braveheart’-Quoting QAnon Speech
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The ”Person of Interest“ and ”Passion of the Christ“ actor spoke at a QAnon Convention over the weekend

Actor Jim Caviezel gave a speech this weekend at a QAnon conference in Las Vegas, and while at least one of his former industry friends was bummed by the “Count of Monte Cristo” actor’s embrace of extremism, the thing a lot of people picked up on is how much he ripped off the movie “Braveheart.”

It’s not clear precisely what day Caviezel appeared at the “For God & Country: Patriot Double Down” convention, but his weirdo speech was posted to Twitter on Sunday night by the account [@patriottakes](https://twitter.com/patriottakes/status/1452462581088673805).

During his speech, Caviezel recited pretty much word-for-word Mel Gibson’s big rallying speech in “Braveheart” — including that “you can take our lives, but you can never take our freedom” line. But don’t worry, he also included the “every man dies. Not every man truly lives” part, speaking in a stilted diction reminiscent of a revival preacher.

Then he got into some non-“Braveheart” QAnon stuff, telling the crowd “We must fight for that authentic freedom and live my friends. By God, we must live and with the Holy Spirit as your shield and Christ as your sword may you join Saint Michael and all the other angels in defending God and sending Lucifer and his henchmen straight back to hell where they belong.” Which, huh. OK.

This being a QAnon speech, he also made a point of telling the crowd, while wagging his finger, “a storm is upon us,” which as people who follow this cult know is a reference to the day, they say, that Donald Trump will suddenly arise to destroy the Satanic, child killing pedophile cabal QAnon lunatics believe control Hollywood and the Democratic Party.

At the end of the almost 20-minute speech, Caviezel referenced the popular QAnon conspiracy of the “Storm,” or a judgment day in which Donald Trump would order mass arrests for the elite cannibalistic cabal — made up of celebrities, government officials and Democrat politicians — that they believe is responsible a global child sex trafficking ring.

Have a look for yourself below:

As you can imagine, this provoked some pretty intense reactions. Take Kirk Acevedo, who starred alongside Caviezel in “Thin Red Line” (1998), who was shocked and surprised by the whole thing. “Your words are dangerous and filled with hate,” Acevedo wrote. “What happened my friend?”

Film critic Mark Kermode drew parallels between Caviezel’s career and the crazy Christian slant of QAnon’s conspiratorial beliefs.

Michael Rappaport suggested a different Mel Gibson speech for Caviezel’s next public address. (Though we suspect [he meant Mel Gibson’s ex-girlfriend](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/caught-on-tape-mel-gibson-race-rant-to-girlfriend-2017256.html), not his ex-wife.)

Some people, like actor Bradley Whitford, expressed more serious concerns about the speech.

> Another example of the fact that the only religious voices we hear are voices of condemnation and exclusion. Caviezal embodies the Right’s perverse weaponization of the inversion of the values of Jesus Christ. There is no love in it. Only hatred and the threat of violence.

Whitford also had a pretty good joke though, to be clear.

Prop Master Says He Turned Down ‘Rust’ Job Because of ‘Massive Red Flags’
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Neal W. Zoromski tells the LA Times he was offered the job a few weeks before the start of filming

A prop master with 30 years of experience in the film industry turned down work on “Rust” over serious concerns about the production.

In [an interview with the Los Angeles Times](https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2021-10-25/prop-master-alec-baldwin-rust-accident-waiting-to-happen), prop master Neal W. Zoromski said he had been in talks with film managers of “Rust” to fulfill the role on the project, but that ultimately he passed after getting a “bad feeling.”

“There were massive red flags,” the prop master, whose prop credits include “Day After Tomorrow,” and “Thank You for Smoking,” told the newspaper.

[![Image 10: halyna hutchins](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/halyna-hutchins1-150x150.jpg)](https://www.thewrap.com/rust-petition-ban-real-guns-film-sets/)

What concerned Zoromski the most was his request for five technicians in the department, a figure he revised to two due to the fim’s low budget. But producers wanted one person to serve as both assistant prop master and armorer, he told The Times.

“You never have a prop assistant double as the armorer,” he said. “Those are two really big jobs.”

Zoromski also told the newspaper that production managers were being “evasive” about certain employment questions he had, and he had difficulty obtaining a reply about the budget allocated for his kit. He also said that the production not having a prop manager two weeks out was a concern.

“In the movies, the prep is everything. …You also need time to clean, inspect and repair guns,” he told the newspaper. “You need time to fix old clocks. In period films, you are sometimes using antiques. But here, there was absolutely no time to prepare, and that gave me a bad feeling.”

Zoromski decided to pass on the role.

“After I pressed ‘send’ on that last email, I felt, in the pit of my stomach: ‘That is an accident waiting to happen,’” he said.

A rep for “Rust” didn’t immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment on Zoromski’s interview with the Times.

Last Thursday, cinematographer Halyna Hutchins [died after being shot on the film’s New Mexico set](https://www.thewrap.com/crew-member-killed-another-injured-after-prop-gun-misfires-on-alec-baldwin-film-rust/) after actor Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun that struck Hutchins and director Joel Souza. Hutchins died of her injuries after being airlifted to University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque. Souza was also injured and hospitalized in the incident, though[he left the hospital](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/us/joel-souza-released-hospital.html)on Friday.

No, You Can’t Use Federal COVID Relief Loan to Buy a Lamborghini or $57,000 Pokemon Card
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

But some not-very-bright small business owners tried anyway — and got caught

Several people are learning the hard way that you aren’t actually allowed to spend COVID small business stimulus money on collectables or luxury items.

The justice department has released details about several people charged with misusing those funds. Instead of supporting their sinking businesses, some individuals purchased high priced sports cars, visits to strip clubs and even a single prized Pokémon card. The good news: They all got caught.

Purchases like these [fuel a federal watchdog’s claim](https://www.sba.gov/about-sba/oversight-advocacy/office-inspector-general/pandemic-response-oversight#section-header-6)that the Small Business Administration (SBA) overpaid $4.5 billion in grants to self-employed people and that “no system of controls was in place to flag applications with flawed or illogical information” — even claims of up to 1 million employees. And several people exploited the lack of guidelines brazenly.

[Lee Price III pled guilty](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/man-purchased-lamborghini-after-receiving-39-million-ppp-loans) in February to using over $1.6 million of loan money to buy a Lamborghini Urus, a Rolex watch and real estate transactions. He also spent thousands at strip clubs and other Houston night clubs. Price used a portion of the loan money to buy a 2020 Ford F-350 pickup truck. He applied for two fake Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans under Price Enterprise Holdings ($900,000) and 713 Construction Company ($700,000).

According to prosecutors, Georgia native Vinath Oudomsine paid $57,789 — more than two thirds of his federal aid — for a Pokémon card around Jan. 8 2021. [The Washington Post cites](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/10/24/pokemon-card-fraud-case-covid-relief/) “the wire-fraud charge brought last week against Oudomsine” as “part of a federal crackdown on alleged misuse of massive relief programs that threw lifelines to businesses during the pandemic but also raised concerns about scams and waste.”

Oudomsine had sought a business loan for a company of 10 employees and revenue of $235,000 over a year back in July, 2020. The next month, court documents state, the SBA deposited $85,000 into a bank account in Oudomsine’s name.

Prosecutors accused Oudomsine of abusing the SBA’s Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) for small businesses hurting during the pandemic because of shutdowns and stay-at-home orders. Officials said that EIDL funds could go toward payroll, sick leave and other business costs such as rent.

Court filings didn’t specify which “Pocket Monster” image the card held.

David T. Hines of Miami, Flor. also put his fraudulently obtained approximately $3.9 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans toward a $318,000 Lamborghini sports car for himself. Hines pleaded guilty for the offense.

In May of 2020, authorities arrested reality TV star Maurice “Mo” Fayne for spending more than $1.5 million of his aid on eighty-five thousand dollars worth of jewelry, forty-thousand dollars worth of child support payments and a 2019 Rolls-Royce Wraith luxury coupe.

Fayne, a trucking company owner who appears regularly on the reality show “Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta,” fought the disputes about his use of Small Business Administration stimulus funds for personal expenses rather than for paying workers and small business expenses as the program required.

[The Washington Post reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/10/24/pokemon-card-fraud-case-covid-relief/)that “the first person to be charged with fraudulently seeking PPP loans was recently sentenced to 56 months in prison, following a nationwide search after the man faked his death.” Other situations are still unfolding.

Academy Museum’s New Film Series to Explore Austrian-Jewish Filmmakers Who Built Hollywood
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

”Vienna in Hollywood“ will spotlight the industry pioneers who fled Nazi persecution to launch the classical era

The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures will present six weeks of programming exploring the large community of predominately Jewish, Austrian-born film artists and movie industry professionals who helped establish Hollywood’s classical era, the museum announced on Monday.

Artists that will be included in the focus include directors Billy Wilder, Fritz Lang, Fred Zinneman and Otto Preminger; actors Hedy Lamarr, Peter Lorre and Paul Henreid, producers Eric Pleskow and Sam Spiegel, as well as many others.

The six-week program launches on Dec. 10 with the two-day symposium “Vienna in Hollywood: The Influence and Impact of Austrians on the Hollywood Film Industry, 19202-2020s.” The symposium is organized by the Academy Museum, USC Libraries and the USC Max Kade Institute, with support from the Austrian Consulate in Los Angeles.

[![Image 18: Academy Museum of Motion Pictures](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Academy-Museum-150x150.jpg)](https://www.thewrap.com/academy-museum-of-motion-pictures-oscar-timeline/)

“Our team has been collaborating with the USC Libraries, USC Max Kade Institute, and liaising with the Austrian consulate for more than 18 months to bring this series to fruition,” Bill Kramer, director and president of the Academy Museum, told TheWrap. “We’re excited to finally share it with the world and shine a spotlight on the Austrian-born community that was so instrumental in shaping early Hollywood.”

The announcement comes on the heels of [an Oct. 15 article](https://forward.com/news/476670/jews-built-hollywood-so-why-is-their-history-erased-from-the-academys-new/) in the Jewish publication Forward criticizing the museum’s lack of focus on the Jewish immigrants involved in the building of Hollywood. Wrote the author of the article, Sharon Rosen Leib, “…after touring the museum’s seven stories, I discovered that Hollywood’s pioneers, who busted their _tucheses_ (Yiddish for rear ends) building the industry it celebrates, ended up on the cutting room floor.”

Many have gotten their first glimpse of the museum in recent weeks. The $484-million edifice on the corner of Fairfax Ave. and Wilshire Blvd. opened to the public on Sept. 30.

[![Image 19: The anatomical exhibit shows a body and head with visible muscles and tissues, displayed inside a glass case at a museum](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Academy-Museum-sci-fi-1-150x150.jpg)](https://www.thewrap.com/look-inside-the-academy-museum-from-rosebud-and-et-to-studio-ghibli-and-midsommar-photos/)

“During the classical Hollywood era, so many beloved films and so many components of the movie industry were shaped by Austrian emigres, including Erich von Stroheim, Max Steiner, Vicki Baum, Fritz Lang and many others,” Kramer said. “The Academy Museum is deeply committed to scholarly and dynamic explorations of film history. We are thrilled to be presenting the work and vision of these groundbreaking artists and professionals whoa re a core part of our cinematic history.”

Paul Lerner, professor of history at USC and director of USC’s Max Kade Institute for Austrian-German-Swiss Studies, said in the statement, “The Max Kade Institute is thrilled to partner with the museum and the USC Libraries for this wonderful series of events on the unique Austrian contributions to Hollywood cinema and Austrian and American cross-cultural cinematic currents. Vienna in Hollywood perfectly embodies the Institute’s founding mission of documenting the lives and work of German-speaking emigres and exiles in Southern California, those predominately Jewish refugees from Nazi-controlled Central Europe who shaped the landscapes and cultures of Los Angeles in the 1940s and beyond.”

Alec Baldwin-Narrated Doc on Flint Water Crisis Postpones Release After ‘Rust’ Tragedy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

”Flint: Who Can You Trust?“ was set to open Friday

The release of the Alec Baldwin-narrated documentary “Flint: Who Can You Trust?” has been indefinitely postponed after the shooting death of Halyna Hutchins on the set of “Rust.”

The film was set for a platform release at the Laemmle Santa Monica and the Village East in New York this Friday with a rollout to more theaters in the following weeks and a digital release in mid-November. But those plans have been shelved for now, representatives for the film’s distributor Cargo Film & Releasing said.

Directed by Anthony Baxter, the film interviews residents in Flint, Michigan, about the 2014 scandal that saw the poisoning of the town’s water supply after local utility officials switched the water source from the Great Lakes to the nearby, polluted Flint River.

[![Image 22: Hilaria Baldwin Alec Baldwin](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Hilaria-Baldwin-Alec-Baldwin-150x150.jpg)](https://www.thewrap.com/hilaria-baldwin-comment-rust-alec-baldwin-shooting-halyna-hutchins/)

But this past Thursday, Baldwin became the center of a film set disaster when he accidentally killed the cinematographer Hutchins and injured director Joel Souza with a prop gun on the set of the independent Western film “Rust” in rural New Mexico.

According to [Souza’s account](https://www.thewrap.com/rust-shooting-alec-baldwin-new-details-rehearse/) of the incident to police, Baldwin, who is both a star and producer on the film was practicing cross-drawing his gun when it suddenly discharged. Baldwin and Souza had been informed by assistant director Dave Halls, who has been the subject of complaints over weapons safety on a 2019 production, that the gun did not have live rounds loaded.

Hours before Hutchins’ death, several members of the camera crew had walked off the set in protest of poor working conditions on the production, including a lack of lodging near the set that forced members to drive an hour to a hotel when the shooting day ends.

[![Image 23: bonanza creek ranch alec baldwin rust](https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/bonanza-creek-ranch-alec-baldwin-rust-1-150x150.jpg)](https://www.thewrap.com/rust-shooting-alec-baldwin-new-details-rehearse/)

Hutchins’ death has been met with outrage with members of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, who have been organizing for months against poor working conditions in Hollywood and are debating whether to ratify a new contract that union officials say will improve those conditions.

Baldwin, who has been cooperating with an ongoing investigation by the Santa Fe Sheriff’s Department, released a statement on Friday mourning Hutchins’ death.

“There are no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother and deeply admired colleague of ours,” [he wrote](https://twitter.com/AlecBaldwin/status/1451572461787439106). “I’m fully cooperating with the police investigation to address how this tragedy occurred and I am in touch with her husband, offering my support to him and his family. My heart is broken for her husband, their son, and all who knew and loved Halyna.”
