Even though the first [**_Thor_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/thor/) movie grossed almost $450 million in 2011, few people walking out of the theater probably thought the God of Thunder would go where Captain America and Iron Man could not and earn a fourth entry in his franchise. Sure, some of this achievement has to do with Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. completing their stories in [**_Avengers: Endgame_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/avengers-endgame/). But it has just as much to do with the revelation of Chris Hemsworth’s comedic abilities and the total tonal shift director Taikia Waititi brought to [**_Thor: Ragnarok_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/thor-ragnarok/).

For this unprecedented fourth solo movie, [**_Thor: Love and Thunder_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/thor-love-and-thunder/), Hemsworth and Waititi not only reprise their roles as Thor and Korg but they’re joined by a team of Academy Award winners and fan favorites. These remarkable talents will help tell the next chapter in Thor’s story, which finds him looking for his place in the galaxy after dealing with the trauma of failing to stop Thanos and losing his home planet Asgard.

Since it’s been five years since **_Ragnarok_**, and even longer since some characters have been in the MCU, here’s a quick rundown of the new and returning faces in **_Love and Thunder_**.

Chris Hemsworth as Thor Odinson
-------------------------------

In the lead role is Chris Hemsworth as Thor, son of Odin. We last left Thor taking the first steps down the path of healing in **_Endgame_**. After losing an eye and his planet in **_Ragnorok_**, Thor lost his brother Loki and was beaten by Thanos in [**_Avengers: Infinity War_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/avengers-infinity-war/). A broken and depressed Thor rejoined the Avengers, but he found real catharsis when time travel allowed him to speak one last time with his mother Frigga. Throughout these movies, Hemsworth has shown that he’s much more than a big strong guy.

After regularly appearing on Australian television throughout the 2000s, Hemsworth made his film debut as George Kirk, father of James T., in J.J. Abram’s 2009 [**_Star Trek_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/star-trek/) reboot. That same year, Hemsworth shot **_Cabin in the Woods_** (which would not be released until 2012) for Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon. Those experiences helped Hemsworth win the role of Thor, which itself spun off to well-liked performances in movies such as **_Blackhat_** and **_Rush_**.

But his most notable non-Marvel role may be Kevin in [**_Ghostbusters_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/ghostbusters/), which gave him a chance to show off his comedic chops. Since then, Hemsworth has embraced more comedy roles, developing skills sure to come in handy for **_Love and Thunder_**.

Natalie Portman as Jane Foster / The Mighty Thor
------------------------------------------------

Perhaps the most surprising member of the **_Love and Thunder_** cast is Natalie Portman as Jane Foster. Although Hemsworth was a relative unknown when cast as Thor, Portman was an incredibly popular actor in 2011, winning an Academy Award in 2010 for **_Black Swan_** and starring in the [**_Star Wars_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/star-wars/) prequels. However, after original director Patty Jenkins was replaced by Alan Taylor for **_Thor: The Dark World_**, Portman left the MCU, seemingly for good. In the years that followed, Portman worked with some of the best directors, including Terrence Malick on [**_Knight of Cups_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/knight-of-cups-review/), Alex Garland in [**_Annihilation_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/annihilation-ending-explained/), and Pablo Larraín in **_Jackie_**, for which she received another best actress nomination.

At this point, we don’t know exactly what drew Portman back into the world of Thor. But you can be sure that her character’s new status had something to do with it, as she will be lifting Mjolnir as the new God of Thunder.

Christian Bale as Gorr the God Butcher
--------------------------------------

Another big return in **_Love and Thunder_** comes not from within the MCU, but from the Distinguished Competition. Christian Bale makes his way back to superhero movies to play Gorr the God Butcher, a creature bent on murdering gods of every pantheon.

Comic book fans know Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman in Christopher Nolan’s[**_Dark Knight_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/the-dark-knight/) trilogy. In the 10 years since **_The Dark Knight Rises_**, Bale has remained very busy, appearing in 11 films. Those films earned Bale two Academy Award nominations, including best actor for **_American Hustle_** and best supporting actor for **_The Big Short_**.

Before putting on Batman’s cape and cowl, Bale debuted as a child actor, earning praise for his performance in Steven Spielberg’s **_Empire of the Sun_** at age 13. Since then, Bale has played in a wide range of movies, from Disney musicals **_Newsies_** and **_Pocahontas_** to horror films **_The Machinist_** and [**_American Psycho_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/american-psycho-vital-satire-of-masculinity/). That range will serve him well as he brings a terrifying character to life in a seemingly goofy movie.

Tessa Thompson as Valkyrie
--------------------------

A standout from **_Thor: Ragnarok_**, Tessa Thompson returns as Valkyrie, the king of New Asgard. **_Love and Thunder_** marks Thompson’s third movie with Hemsworth, as the two starred together in [**_Men in Black: International_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/men-in-black-international-review/). But Thompson also previously worked with Portman on **_Annihilation_**.

Thompson came to prominence first during the second season of [**_Veronica Mars_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/veronica-mars/) and in films such as **_For Colored Girls_**. Her breakout role was as a provocative radio host in 2014’s **_Dear White People_**, which led to parts in Ryan Coogler’s **_Creed_** and the satire [**_Sorry to Bother You_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/sorry-to-bother-you-review-a-potent-prickly-debut/). More recently, Thompson starred opposite Ruth Negga in the award-winning **_Passing_**, directed by Rebecca Hall.

Thompson’s brief cameo in **_Avengers: Endgame_** showed us a Valkyrie at home and at peace in New Asgard. But if rumors are true that **_Love and Thunder_** follows her search for a queen, then Thompson will get ample opportunity to use her full range as an actor.

Taika Waititi as Korg
---------------------

Arguably the most popular character from **_Ragnarok_**, Korg is a gentle alien made of rocks who settled in New Asgard after helping Thor escape the Grandmaster. Since then, it appears that Korg has spent his time either playing video games with his bug friend Miek or playing Tom Servo to Deadpool’s Crow T. Robot while [roasting the **_Free Guy_** trailer](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/first-deadpool-mcu-crossover-footage/).

The even bigger breakout is Korg’s voice actor, Taika Waititi, director of **_Ragnorok_** and **_Love and Thunder_**. Waititi started in his native New Zealand, creating a 2005 short film **_Two Cars, One Night_**, which earned an Academy Award nomination. In addition to working with **_Flight of the Conchords_** and appearing with Ryan Reynolds in [**_Green Lantern_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/green-lantern/), Waititi wrote, starred, and directed the vampire comedy **_What We Do in the Shadows_**, which spawned a successful television series. **_Ragnorok_**’s success allowed Waititi to direct the Oscar-winning film **_Jojo Rabbit_** and make appearances in [**_The Mandalorian_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/the-mandalorian/)and [**_The Suicide Squad_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/the-suicide-squad/). After Love and Thunder, Waititi will next direct a **_Star Wars_** film.

One hopes that none of this success will go to Korg’s head, as the kindly Kronun returns to aid his buddy Thor once again.

Chris Pratt as Peter Quill/Star-Lord
------------------------------------

While he’s busy shooting [**_Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/guardians-of-the-galaxy-3-news/) and this year’s **_Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special_**, Chris Pratt’s Star-Lord and his fellow a-holes dropped by for Thor’s latest adventure. More than a mere cameo, Star-Lord and the Guardians’ appearance continues the storylines from **_Infinity War_** and **_Endgame_**, which teamed the God of Thunder with Rocket (aka Rabbit) and Groot (aka Tree). If the teaser trailer is any indication, Star-Lord’s advice will help Thor take his next steps.

For Pratt, Star-Lord has been a career-changer. Before his casting in the first **_Guardians_** film, Pratt was best known for his roles in CW series **_Everwood_** and the NBC comedy **_Parks and Recreation_**. Since **_Guardians_**, Pratt has become a true movie star, with lead roles in **_The Lego Movie_** and its sequel, the three **_Jurassic World_** films, and the upcoming [**_Super Mario Bros._**](https://www.denofgeek.com/games/chris-pratt-mario-nintendo-movie-cast-reactions/) movie. But based on the positive reaction to his brief comic scene with Hemsworth in **_Infinity War_**, Pratt’s most anticipated appearance may be the return of Star-Lord in **_Love and Thunder_**.

Russell Crowe as Zeus
---------------------

Like Christian Bale, Russell Crowe will make the jump from the DCEU, where he played the Superman’s father, Jor-El, in [**_Man of Steel_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/man-of-steel/) and **_Zack Snyder’s Justice League_**, to the Marvel Universe, where he’ll play Greek god Zeus.

Crowe will certainly bring his larger-than-life demeanor to his performance as the ruler of the Greek pantheon. However, Crowe has shown himself to be a remarkably diverse actor, at home in realistic dramas and genre pieces.The New Zealand actor was nominated for three consecutive best actor Oscars from 2000-2002, winning for Ridley Scott’s **_Gladiator_**. He’s also received praise for dramas such as **_Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World_** and **_L.A. Confidential_**, as well as the musical **_Les Misérables_** and the comedy **_The Nice Guys_**.

He will be returning to the world of comic book heroes next year, when he plays the titular character’s father in [**_Kraven the Hunter_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/kraven-the-hunter-marvel-stories-that-could-inspire-the-spider-man-spinoff/).

Karen Gillan as Nebula
----------------------

While Zoe Saldana’s Gamora appears to be missing from the Guardians crew, he sister Nebula will be present. The Scottish actress broke out among genre fans in her four-year run as Amy Pond, companion to Matt Smith’s [**_Doctor Who_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/doctor-who/). In addition to those roles, Gillan co-starred with John Cho in the well-received sitcom **_Selfie_** and in the Mike Flanagan horror film **_Oculus_**. Outside of her Marvel work, Gillan’s biggest success has come playing one of the avatars in **_Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle_** and its sequel **_The Next Level_**.

Gillan beat her **_Love and Thunder_**co-stars to cinemas this year by appearing in **_Dual_**, which released on April 15.

Pom Klementieff as Mantis
-------------------------

The newest member of the Guardians had limited screentime with Thor in **_Infinity War_**, so hopefully we’ll get to see more of them together in **_Love and Thunder_**. The French actress made her American debut in Spike Lee’s poorly-regarded remake of Park Chan-wook’s **_Oldboy_** in 2013. Since joining the MCU in **_Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2_**, Klementieff has appeared in James Gunn’s superhero follow-up, [**_The Suicide Squad_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/the-suicide-squad/), as well as **_Uncut Gems_** and **_The Addams Family_**.

Dave Bautista as Drax the Destroyer
-----------------------------------

While Drax only spent a few minutes with Thor in **_Endgame_**, he made the most of it, so here’s hoping he’ll get more chances to dunk on Quill while praising the God of Thunder. The breakout actor of the **_Guardians_** films, Bautista was formerly best known as a wrestler in the WWE. After his turn as Drax, Bautista showed more comic timing and surprising depth in movies such as **_Blade Runner 2049_**, **_My Spy_**, and [**_Dune_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/dune/). In addition to the next Guardians film, Bautista can also be seen reprising his role as the Beast Rabban in the highly anticipated **_Dune: Part Two_**.

Vin Diesel as Groot
-------------------

As the teenage “Tree,” Groot played a crucial role in helping Thor fight Thanos in **_Infinity War,_** even becoming the handle for his ax Stormbreaker. While we don’t know what Groot will do with Thor in **_Love and Thunder_**, we can probably guess what he’ll say. In his performance as Groot, Vin Diesel continues a tradition of excellent voice acting that began with Brad Bird’s animated feature **_The Iron Giant_**. Diesel also found more success as Groot than he did attempting to launch a new cinematic universe in 2020’s [**_Bloodshot_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/bloodshot/), based on the Valiant Comics superhero. But everybody knows that superheroes are only secondary to Diesel’s true franchise loves, the **_Riddick_** series that began with **_Pitch Dark_**, and the [**_Fast and Furious_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/fast-and-furious/) films, which saw its ninth entry last year.

Bradley Cooper as Rocket Raccoon
--------------------------------

Along with Groot, Rocket (aka “rabbit”) accompanied Thor not only to the weapon-making planet Nidavellir, but also to Asgard of the past, retrieving the Reality Stone while Frigga comforted her son. Even if Thor appears to no longer have use for the fake eye Rocket secured for him, it’s clear that the two have a bond greater than any of the other Guardians.

Latest Movie reviews
--------------------

It’s also clear that **_Love and Thunder_** will give Cooper another chance to do comedy, something he deeply loves. No matter how many accolades he receives, the actor repeatedly returns to comedy, appearing in movies such a **_Wet Hot American Summer_**, **_The Hangover_**, and **_Silver Linings Playbook_**. However, Cooper has shown himself to be far more than a handsome guy with a good sense of humor. The actor has earned praise for not only his dramatic roles in movies such as **_American Sniper_** and [**_Nightmare Alley_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/movies/nightmare-alley-2021-vs-nightmare-alley-1947-what-are-differences/), but also for the Oscar-nominated film **_A Star is Born_**, in which he starred and directed.

Jaimie Alexander as Lady Sif
----------------------------

Given the way the Warriors Three were so uncerimoniously dispatched in **_Ragnarok_**, it’s reasonable to assume that Lady Sif died off screen. After all, the character has only appeared on TV since **_The Dark World_**, in two episodes of [**_Agents of SHIELD_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/agents-of-shield/), as a memory in **_Loki_**, and alternate reality versions in two episodes of [**_What If…?._**](https://www.denofgeek.com/what-if/) But Lady Sif will come back alive and in the flesh in **_Love and Thunder_**, once again played by Jaimie Alexander.

Even if Sif hasn’t been seen lately, Alexander has certainly remained busy. The actor, who got her first break in the sci-fi series **_Kyle XY_**, starred in 100 episodes of the NBC show [**_Blindspot_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/blindspot/).

Matt Damon as Actor Loki
------------------------

Unsurprisingly, Thor’s mischievous brother/arch-enemy Loki will make an appearance in **_Love and Thunder_**. However, the official cast lists indicate that he will be played by Matt Damon, reprising his role as an Asgardian actor portraying Loki alongside fellow thesbians Sam Neill as Odin and Luke Hemsworth as Thor. Melissa McCarthy is slated to appear as an actor portraying Hela, the Ragnarok villain played by Cate Blanchett.

There’s currently no indication that Tom Hiddleston will be returning as the real Loki, but that makes sense. The Prime Loki died at the start of **_Infinity War_** and Variant Loki from the [**_Loki_**](https://www.denofgeek.com/loki/) Disney+ series is on the run with Sylvie. It does not appear that Loki will hassle Thor on his latest adventure. But if there’s one thing we’ve learned about Loki, it’s that appearances can be deceiving.

**_Thor: Love and Thunder_** releases July 8, 2022
