Michael Buckner for PMC

“We have so much coming your way that you might tell us, ‘Okay, take a break now!'” said [Victoria Alonso](https://variety.com/t/victoria-alonso/), executive VP of film production at [Marvel](https://variety.com/t/marvel/) Studios, during a conversation with Marc Malkin, _Variety_ Senior Editor of Culture and Events, at this year’s NALIP Media Summit.

As an executive producer on Marvel’s “[WandaVision](https://variety.com/t/wandavision/)” and “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,” Alonso played a key role in earning the studio a historic 28 Emmy nominations. But instead of pausing to show off her superpowers, Alonso is already running toward her next adventure.

“Balance is the key to how we can be better storytellers, more efficient filmmakers, better executives, better people,” Alonso said during a conversation that addressed diversity and inclusion in superhero stories and Marvel’s venture into animated television She added that while it is not Marvel’s “mandate” to change society, the company looks at where the world is and listens to its fans.

“I think it’s important to consistently listen to what fans are saying,” Alonso said. “If t here’s a vast majority that feels that something is not hitting home, then we need to look at it,but then there’s times where we say, ‘You know what,this is a story we’re gonna tell.'”

With “[Loki](https://variety.com/t/loki/)” featuring Marvel’s first gender-fluid character and “Black Panther” and “Captain Marvel” marking important steps in Black and female representation on screen, one of Alonso’s goals is to increase diversity and visibility.

“There’s something really magical about being seen,” she said. “When you are being seen, the shame drips down like there’s no tomorrow. There’s a layer of shame that goes away, there’s a layer of ‘I don’t belong, I don’t deserve it, I am not worthy’ that goes away.”

Buenos Aires born Alonso also spoke about her own experiences as a gay woman trying to climb the Hollywood ranks.

“I walked into rooms that I wasn’t invited to,but I should have been there,and I just sat there until somebody asked me to leave,” Alonso said. “If you cannot find your fit in those rooms, make your own rooms for you. If the room didn’t want me, I walked away, unless I felt like I belonged in that room, and I refreshed their minds of the reasons why I should be there.”

Alonso also discussed Marvel’s groundbreaking TV series, calling streaming a “gift” for allowing the studio to expand the stories of characters such as Wanda and Vision.

“When the chance of being a part of this streaming world came about, we were beyond excited because all of a sudden we could actually give the fans far more than 1/4 of a page or three cool moves.”

While Marvel’s next show, “What If…?” will be the studio’s first animated series, it is far from the last.

“We’re going to have our animation branch and mini studio, and there will be more to come from that as well,” Alonso said. “We’re super excited about animation, which is my first love.”

Finally, Alonso also offered important advice to young storytellers looking to break into the industry.

“You don’t need a cape, y ou don’t need a hammer, y ou don’t need a shield. Y our superpower is your voice, and your voice will create change for yourself,for society and for those who you love,” Alonso said. “If you use your voice,you will create the kind of energy that will bring change to us. T o not use your voice is silence,and silence is poison.”

### Do Not Sell My Personal Information

This page enables California residents to opt-out of sharing of information that may be a sale of personal information under the CCPA. Please review all of your choices below. You can also review our [Privacy Policy.](https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#california)

**Contact Information & Subscription Information**

 We sell or license certain information, such as contact information or subscription information, to third parties to provide you with offers and promotions and opportunities that may be of interest to you. If you would like to opt out of the sale of this information, please use this [webform](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/e65b3c4c-fa81-40d2-9df0-c7e99bf5f900/433ac076-21f3-4342-b391-a4d7d631cd3f.html) or call our automated line at (877) 365-3500.

**Opt Out of Advertising Cookies**

 PMC and our advertising partners use cookies and other technologies to collect and share certain information such as your usage activity to deliver ads that are more relevant to you on PMC and other sites or apps. This may be considered a "sale” under the CCPA. You can opt out of this type of sharing by us using the toggle above. When the toggle is enabled, targeted advertising cookies are on. This opt out does not affect other cookies such as strictly necessary or essential cookies. For more information about cookies please see our [Privacy Policy](https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#california).

 You must exercise this choice every PMC site and on each device and browser where you want your choice to apply. If you clear cookies, you must opt out again. You may still receive ads from us (including contextual or based on our own data about you). We will still share some information with those of our partners who function as our service providers, such as to help us measure ad effectiveness, control the frequency, delivery and security of ads, and conduct analytics. This will not opt you out of the use of previously collected and shared information or all interest-based advertising (such as that conducted on other sites). 

 You can also update your browser settings or visit www.aboutads.info/choices to opt-out of certain uses of cookies for advertising purposes. 

 Our downstream partners who are not service providers may re-sell this information. You can request to opt out of such activity by clicking [here](https://www.iabprivacy.com/optout.html) to see a list of participants in the IAB (some of which are our partners) and submitting an opt out request on each entity’s site. Even if you opt out through this link, you will still see ads.

You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.

#### Sale of Personal Data

- [x] Sale of Personal Data 

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information to third parties. These cookies collect information for analytics and to personalize your experience with targeted ads. You may exercise your right to opt out of the sale of personal information by using this toggle switch. If you opt out we will not be able to offer you personalised ads and will not hand over your personal information to any third parties. Additionally, you may contact our legal department for further clarification about your rights as a California consumer by using this Exercise My Rights link.

If you have enabled privacy controls on your browser (such as a plugin), we have to take that as a valid request to opt-out. Therefore we would not be able to track your activity through the web. This may affect our ability to personalize ads according to your preferences.
