# Anthony Mackie Is Captain America Now. How About That?

Captain America walks into a bar. It’s three o’clock on a Tuesday afternoon in December and the place is empty, save for an older woman and her Chihuahua parked at the edge of the counter. The 1978 _Superman_ starring Christopher Reeve, playing on a screen behind the counter, has their attention. The swells of John Williams’s score blend with Donell Jones’s “Where I Wanna Be,” which hums through the venue’s speakers. Somewhere in the back is Skee-Ball. And billiards. You can order a Lahmacun Turkish Pizza here. There’s more New Orleans Saints signage in the joint than is possible to humanly catalog, including on the bartender, who whirls around to reveal a shirt bearing the fleur-de-lis. “Hey, y’all,” she says.

Half Moon Bar & Restaurant. Lower Garden District, New Orleans. A hell of a place.

Anthony Mackie orders a Crown and Coke, which comes out in a plastic cup with a little black straw poking out of it. A Blue Moon for me. We head outside to the patio, where there are a half dozen or so empty garden tables and a fence facing the street. Mackie takes a seat and lights a cigar. “The Connecticut,” he says, introducing his stogie varietal. He leans back and encases himself in an enormous cloud of smoke.

When Mackie was in high school, he and his buddies would hang around this block, sneaking fifty-cent beers. They’d drink and talk shit. He still comes here, thirty years later, because Tito, the bartender, doesn’t give two fucks about what movies he’s in. Not even the biggest release of his career: _Captain America: Brave New World_, out February 14, which sees Mackie become the leading man—Captain America—of the behemoth [Marvel Cinematic Universe](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/g13441903/all-marvel-cinematic-universe-movies-ranked/). Tito just wants to know how he’s doing and if he wants a Budweiser.

We have roughly the time it takes for the Connecticut to disappear to put a bow on, or maybe even make peace with, what we’ve wrestled with over our past four hours together, spread across conversations in New York City and New Orleans.

Mackie’s brother has a saying: _To whom much is given, much is expected_. It almost feels like his very own _With great power comes great responsibility,_ but unlike Peter Parker, Mackie has a counterpoint.

To whom much is worked for, much is what?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

He did the math. Malcolm Gladwell has said that when you put ten thousand hours into your craft, you’re a master of it. Anthony Mackie put 11,357 hours into acting by the time he graduated from Juilliard. He gave up his junior and senior years of high school in his hometown to study theater at boarding school, moved thousands of miles away to live in a shitty apartment in New York City—far from family, friends, everything—where he worked his ass off to learn everything he possibly could.

Twenty-four years passed.

A week ago, Mackie posed his counterpoint directly to me: “To whom much is worked for, much is what? Because to whom much is given, much is expected.” The first time he says it, it rings somewhere between rhetorical question and haiku—maybe even bullshit. But Mackie is dead serious in his delivery. He’s asking, What happens when you do every single thing you’re supposed to do, become one of the best at what you do, and the reward isn’t there?

He’s Captain America now. A quarter century after he completed his ten thousand hours. Fifteen years after his first shoulda-got-the-statue performance. Ten-plus years after Marvel cast him as the sidekick.

What took so long?

The first time we meet is under an excessively large Christmas tree. We’re at the Drawing Room in the Greenwich Hotel in lower Manhattan, and the vibe is maximum New York City During the Holidays: fireplace, fake presents, tourists fluttering in and out with hot drinks, shedding layers just to put them back on. If a different John Williams theme—the _Home Alone_ overture—isn’t playing somewhere, it should be.

Anthony Mackie, known golfer, walks in wearing a very golf outfit: white polo shirt tucked into slacks. He shakes my hand and sits next to me—left to right, it’s the excessively large Christmas tree, me, Mackie—and the waiter comes over. “Can I have a tea with honey and a shot of Woodford?” Mackie asks. “Honey. Lemon. Woodford.”

Is this comfortable for you? I ask.

“This is great.”

Thank you for making the time.

“No, thank you.”

Appreciate it.

“It’s always interesting coming to New York.”

We’re both a little bit tight.

In the sea of preternaturally charismatic Marvel actors, the New Orleans native is one of the best red-carpet and late-show talkers: Big stories. Guttural laughs. Turbo hand gestures. But in-person, one-on-one sit-downs are not part of his comfort zone: “Every time I have to do an interview, I’m like, _Ohhhhhhhh,_ take the Benadryl, take a Xanax, and go at it hard,” he says. The laugh that follows suggests he’s only half kidding. (Another moment like this: Later on, he tests my intentions with this joke: “Coming into it, were you like, ‘I’m gonna find out if he beat up kids when he was younger!’ ”) There’s zero pretense with Anthony Mackie—no bullshit, no people-pleasing. Always respectful. Says what he means. But yeah, he’d avoid conversations with probing strangers if he could.

That’ll get harder to do with the release of _Brave New World_. In the [past decade of Marvel shows and films](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a40458776/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu/), Mackie’s Sam Wilson character struggled with—but ultimately embraced—the mantle of Captain America, inheriting the shield from Chris Evans’s Steve Rogers. If the superhero stratosphere has anything resembling a sole leading actor, it’s the one who plays Captain America. That’s Mackie now. _Brave New World_ will kick off a [critical new chapter of the MCU](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/g40266423/marvel-studios-releases/), which will culminate with two new _Avengers_ films. Meaning: His life, sure as the stars and stripes on his new suit, is about to change.

For Mackie, the achievement—top billing in a major studio blockbuster—feels like validation. The credit due for a quarter-century-long career in which he’s been unerringly excellent but never quite broken through to full stardom. By the time he turned thirty, he’d blazed through several films you know by heart: _8 Mile, The Manchurian Candidate, Half Nelson,_ and _Million Dollar Baby_. He’s worked with legends like Eastwood, [Washington](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a62888212/denzel-washington-gladiator-2-interview-2024/), Ford, Demme, and Lee. Played Martin Luther King Jr. and Tupac. He’s stunned in indies (_Half Nelson, The Hurt Locker_), studio comedies (_The Night Before_), sci-fi epics (_Altered Carbon_), historical dramas (_Detroit, The Banker_). His superpower is not that he’s very good at what he does but that he’s very good in _anything_ he does, no matter the size of the role. He’s so consistent that audiences and awards bodies have taken him for granted.

“This ain’t no overnight shit,” Mackie says. With industry events like the [annual Golden Globes ceremony](https://www.esquire.com/style/mens-fashion/g63340653/best-dressed-men-2025-golden-globes/), where he is due to present an award in a few weeks, looming, he adds, “It’s always apropos for me when awards season comes up. Because I know I’ve done at least four performances that could have been nominated—if not for a Golden Globe, then an Oscar or an Emmy.”

We roll-call all four. There’s the 2004 Sundance hit _Brother to Brother,_ in which Mackie plays a young gay man who develops a friendship with an important figure in the Harlem Renaissance. Next is 2006’s _Half Nelson,_ in which he plays Frank alongside Ryan Gosling’s flailing history teacher, which earned Gosling his first Academy Award nomination. Mackie also cites _The Banker,_ the true story of Bernard Garrett, a Black entrepreneur who broke the color line in real estate. (The film debuted exactly two weeks before the pandemic amid a controversy involving Garrett’s son.) The most notable snub is 2009’s _The Hurt Locker,_ the defining film about the Iraq war. He is exceptional as Sergeant J. T. Sanborn. But while the movie won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 2010, only Mackie’s costar, Jeremy Renner, was nominated for his performance.

“Captain America is my Oscar,” he says. “Because I’ve been overlooked so many times in my career.”

* * *

I feel an Anthony Mackie Story coming on. Let’s call this one “The Time I Couldn’t Say My Line in Front of [Harrison Ford](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a43965150/harrison-ford-indiana-jones-interview/).” Context: _Brave New World_ reintroduces big bad Thaddeus Ross, who was originally played by the late William Hurt in several Marvel films from 2008 to 2021. Ford takes over the role as the newly elected president of the United States—with some Hulk-like tendencies. Wilson has to meet Ross in a control room so they can shout at each other.

It’s supposed to go something like this:

Wilson [_Mackie, reenacting the moment in a raised whisper_]: “Why did this happen?”

Ross [_Mackie, in a Fordian growl_]: “THIS IS WHY IT HAPPENED!”

End scene.

“But that was the first fuckin’ scene we shot together,” Mackie says. “So I’m nervous. I’m in my head like, _This is my moment_.”

When he walked into the control room, his mouth and mind failed him. Instead of his lines, all he could muster was a dramatic, “_Ugggggghhaaaaaaaah._”

Cut. Take two.

“_Ugggggghhaaaaaaaah.”_

Cut.

![Image 7: a person leaning against a gate wearing stylish attire](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/esq030125anthonymackiedig-008-6797ef7994a2a.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.957xh;0,0&resize=2048:*)

“And I couldn’t remember my line,” Mackie says, making what sounds like every actor’s worst nightmare into the best bar story I’ve heard in a minute. “I’m like, _Fuck. I’m acting with Harrison Ford._”

Third take isn’t much better, so Ford pulls him out of the room and into the hallway. “You know, it’s not that big of a deal,” the icon says. “Relax, kid.” The kid relaxes. They knock out the scene. Ford shakes his hand: “All right. Let’s go.”

Marvel has specific plot details under wraps, but we do know that Ford will push a few pant sizes to become Red Hulk, Thaddeus Ross’s alter ego. Mackie’s already seen the film. His review: “It’s literally the best movie it can be. It stays in the lines of Marvel. It stays in the lines of Captain America, and it’s fun and it’s big.” Expectations are high, but _Brave New World_ has also been dogged by [rumors of excessive reshoots](https://comicbookmovie.com/captain-america/captain-america-brave-new-world/captain-america-brave-new-world-reshoots-everything-we-know-has-been-added-changed-or-removed-a215757). Mackie promptly downplays the reports: “Every movie that Marvel has made, every movie that DC has made—_Star Wars, Star Trek_, Disney—has done reshoots.”

He offers a similar cool treatment to the inevitable comparisons that will be drawn between the Red Hulk and President Trump. “I hope, as a country, we’re tired of all the political jousting,” he says when I ask if he thinks fans will make that jump. “Let’s just go to the movies and chill the fuck out.” He adds: “We could’ve made this motherfucker yellow and it would’ve been a problem.”

_Brave New World_ arrives not long after the ten-year anniversary of Mackie’s MCU debut. He played Rogers’s sidekick in 2014’s well-received _The Winter Soldier,_ where he was sixth on the call sheet—and he’s insisted that he remain number six ever since. “Even though he was technically number one, we started the call sheet at six and went from there,” says Julius Onah, the director of _Brave New World._“It tells you a tremendous amount about the guy—the fact that he’s ascended to these heights and there’s still this authentic core to him.”

Anthony Russo, who has directed Mackie in four Marvel outings and will helm the two upcoming _Avengers_ movies alongside his brother and directing partner, Joe, confirms that number six is very much a thing on a Mackie-occupied Marvel set. “Every day, he would walk on set—in his booming, theatrical voice—and announce, ‘Number six on set!’ And everybody would break into a smile,” he remembers, adding: “He has an energy to him that just lights up the set in a way that is extremely rare. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen it to the degree that Anthony is capable of it.”

But Mackie is learning that no matter how hard he tries to live life as number six, the world will never treat the actor who plays Captain America so casually. “The expectations of what comes along with this role is something that nobody talks about,” he says, turning sober. “Nobody really acknowledges the mental jousting that takes place. When I walk out of this hotel, I don’t walk out of this hotel as Anthony Mackie. I walk out of this hotel as Captain America.”

About that: It won’t take you too long in the annals of Google to find a couple social-media dispatches detailing interactions between Mackie and fans that went sideways. Example: “anthony mackie is the rudest celebrity i have ever met,” in which a young woman details his pulling up in his “huge fucking truck,” smoking a cigar at a gas station, and rejecting her approach.

![Image 8: individual seated in a brightly lit room with a vintage television and sofa](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/esq030125anthonymackiedig-001-6797efbf281b7.jpg?crop=0.615xw:0.961xh;0.238xw,0.0194xh&resize=980:*)

Mackie recalls the interaction differently. He was already having a bad week—someone had recently found his phone number. One hundred twenty missed calls. AI death threats. He pulled into the gas station and this woman “jumps out of the car and I simply looked at her and said, ‘No.’ ” he recalls. Plus, he adds, another hole in the story: What idiot smokes next to a gas pump?

We follow this thread for another minute, until—just as Mackie says, “Dude, you gotta protect yourself, because if you don’t . . .”—a woman in her fifties and her teenage son step toward us, stopping about ten feet away. Mackie’s face goes blank. She rattles off something that I can’t really make out, but I think she’s citing a mutual connection in New Orleans. He offers a half affirmative. The kid says that he’s a fan and receives a slightly warmer “appreciate it” from Mackie. We all wish each other happy holidays, and they shuffle away.

I remark on the poetry of whatever the fuck that was. “She scared the shit out of me,” he says. “Read the room! There are two dudes in the corner behind a Christmas tree.”

Mackie, of course, is hardly the first celebrity who has found himself on the wrong end of a parasocial relationship with a superhero fan. But Captain America represents perfection. The MCU’s first Captain America, Evans’s Steve Rogers, came of age between World Wars and smacked Nazis around. In _Endgame,_ he gave the mantle to Sam Wilson, a man from the present day with no superpowers. Now Wilson bears the stars and stripes of a country that grows more fractured by the literal hour.

I ask Chris Evans about the weight of the shield. “It’s a two-way street—there’s responsibility that comes with it but also a lot of pride,” Evans says of the role. “It feels like a lot. But then that pressure morphed into an honor.”

* * *

I’ll give it to that fan: Anthony Mackie does drive a huge fucking truck. It’s so big that when you open the door, a kickstand whips out, because the distance from the ground to the passenger seat is approximately seven flights of stairs. He grins, says hi, and politely ignores that I almost face-planted into the seat cushion on my way up. A week after we met in New York, we’re in downtown New Orleans, heading for lunch at his favorite restaurant in the city: Superior Seafood & Oyster Bar. He’s wearing a Detroit flat bill, a gray sweatshirt, and blue sweatpants—we’re on his turf now, and he’s clearly more at ease than he was the last time I saw him. We talk about our busted football parlays from the weekend while a poop-emoji plushie, dangling from the rearview mirror, beams at passing cars. “My son gave me that. He’s like, ‘You’re a big poop-head!’ ”

![Image 9: person standing on a balcony wearing a light coat and white pants](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/esq030125anthonymackiedig-013-6797f19397491.jpg?crop=0.910xw:0.910xh;0.0155xw,0.0552xh&resize=2048:*)

Mackie has four boys, ages ranging from eight to fifteen. He prefers to keep specifics, like names and ages, out of his interviews but, like most parents, can rarely go more than a few minutes without mentioning one of them. Over the course of a year, he’s in New Orleans with them for about two months, depending on his schedule, playing soccer and flying drones. When he’s away at work, they FaceTime as much as possible. Mackie shares them with his ex-wife; the two divorced in 2018. How are things between them now? “_Haaaaarrrrd_ pass!” he says, laughing, when I attempt to broach the subject. “I’ve always kept my personal life out of the business,” he says. “I don’t allow people to photograph my kids. I don’t bring my kids around. I want my kids to be normal.”

We park a block away from the restaurant and walk over. While we cross the street, a different pickup truck—also fucking huge—pulls up to the stoplight. It inches forward . . . forward . . . forward . . . and . . .

_HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONK!_

The guy in the truck slams his horn and screams out the window as if he just saw Bigfoot.

“_IS THAT YOU?!_”

Mackie doesn’t flinch. Later he’ll tell me that only tourists and transplants do this.

He’s home.

At the risk of busting Mackie’s spot, Superior Seafood & Oyster Bar is clearly his happy place. Everyone gets a big hello-how-are-you. He proudly tells me that the tiled ceilings, red-leather booths, wooden columns, and massive dining-room mirror are no coincidence: It was made exactly to look like New York City’s Balthazar, so much so that he says someone from the restaurant was kicked out of the Manhattan dining establishment for taking too many pictures. Most days off, this is where Mackie hangs. “The food is so good and they take care of me and nobody really bothers me,” he says. “They look out for me.”

We take two seats at the bar and he issues a warning to the waitress: “We’re doing an interview, so don’t say anything rude or outlandish.”

“Do I ever do that to you?” she says. “Why do you make it seem like that’s something I’ve done to you?!”

“No! Never. Not you . . .”

“You and I? We’re the best of friends.”

While we settle in, I bring up the news that dropped two hours after we parted ways in New York. _[Deadline](https://deadline.com/2024/12/chris-evans-avengers-doomsday-1236198951/)_ reported that [Chris Evans](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a31982191/chris-evans-defending-jacob-interview-2020/) would return to the MCU in _[Avengers: Doomsday.](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a61717370/avengers-doomsday-cast-news/)_ The timing was so uncanny that I wonder aloud if Mackie was holding out on me.

“I didn’t know!” he says, laughing. “I talked to Chris a few weeks ago and it wasn’t on the table then. At least, he didn’t tell me it was on the table, because I asked him. I was like, ‘You know, they said they’re bringing everyone back for the movie. Are you coming back?’ ”

Mackie deploys a delicious Chris Evans impression that makes the actor sound like he was midway through a mojito somewhere in Turks and Caicos when he took the call. “He goes, ‘Oh, you know, I’m happily retired.’ ”

So you saw that when I did? I ask.

Mackie is adamant: “I learned that right there. My manager showed me. He’s like, ‘Oh, so I guess Chris is coming back.’ That’s all I know. I haven’t seen a script.”

(For what it’s worth, I told Evans that Mackie and I had a laugh about their call and the timing of the reports claiming Evans is returning to the MCU—and Evans was quick to contradict _Deadline_. “That’s not true, though,” he says. “This always happens. I mean, it happens every couple years—ever since _Endgame._ I’ve just stopped responding to it.” Soon I get the same party line that Evans shared with Mackie: “Yeah, no—happily retired!”)

Since Marvel hasn’t offered much info at all regarding the upcoming _Avengers_ movies _Doomsday_(2026) and _Secret Wars_ (2027), Mackie and I ask each other the question on the mind of just about every Marvel loyalist: How will the studio outdo _Endgame_?

“What you don’t want is _Infinity War_ and _Endgame_ 2.0,” he says. Speaking of the directors, he adds, “The Russos, they’re so smart, and they have such a hold on this universe and the history and the comic books that I know they have an idea. I mean, they better have an idea. I don’t know how you put all those people onscreen together and make it work.”

When I talk to Anthony Russo, it’s clear that he does, indeed, have an idea—at least as far as Mackie’s Captain America is concerned. “He represents a unique space in the _Avengers_ spectrum,” he says. “And that’s the greatest thing, because sooner or later the collective storytelling is going to be in that space he occupies.”

* * *

The origin story of Anthony Mackie goes something like this. He’s the youngest of five siblings—three sisters and two brothers—born to Martha and Willie, who owned a roofing business. “I was very close to my mom,” he says, but she died when he was young. After such an unexpected, painful loss, we look for comfort wherever we can find it. Mackie is no different. “To be honest, morbidly enough, it was the best thing that ever happened. Because our relationship was so tight. I would have never left home if my mom hadn’t passed. I would never have taken that initiative.”

When he was thirteen years old, Mackie went to the Alabama Shakespeare Festival, where its founders built a theater right by a lake. It was his first time seeing the world outside of the Big Easy. “It changed my entire idea of what I wanted my life to be,” he says. A few years later, his older brother paid for him to go to boarding school at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts. For college, he applied and was accepted to Juilliard, where he watched every Broadway play, good, bad, shitty, transcendent. He graduated in 2001 and earned his graduate degree on the sets of _8 Mile, The Manchurian Candidate, Half Nelson,_ and _Million Dollar Baby_. Supporting roles that not only left an impact but had Mackie orbiting greats.

In the early aughts, he starred in not one but two [Spike Lee](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/music/a34286588/david-byrne-spike-lee-american-utopia-interview/) joints in a single year: 2004’s _Sucker Free City_ and _She Hate Me_. The latter is an especially fascinating rewatch; Mackie plays a fired pharmaceutical businessman who sells his sperm to lesbian couples for cash. It’s a Spike-sized grab bag of ideas that would fall apart entirely without Mackie’s sturdy presence. “I always tell people I hold the title of being the lead of the two Spike Lee movies nobody saw,” he quips.

![Image 11: individual lounging on a vintage couch in a room with natural light](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/esq030125anthonymackiedig-004-6797f1d616f65.jpg?resize=2048:*)

But that doesn’t mean his talent went unnoticed, especially by Onah, who also has Spike Lee bona fides, having interned for him in the early 2000s. “Authenticity is the hardest fucking thing to find,” Onah says. “He makes it look so deceptively easy, but he has such incredible command of his instrument and an understanding of his body and his voice as an actor.”

After Mackie’s breakout in _The Hurt Locker,_ he played a spot-on Tupac in 2009’s _Notorious_ and a sci-fi boxing promoter in 2011’s _Real Steel._ Don’t forget 2013’s _Pain & Gain,_ the Michael Bay extravaganza featuring the roid-raging trio of characters embodied by Mackie, Mark Wahlberg, and Dwayne “the Rock” Johnson. It was around this time that Mackie started writing letters to Marvel, wanting to play Black Panther. The studio saw things differently and cast him as Wilson in _The Winter Soldier._ “Very rarely at Marvel Studios, or any studio, is an actor offered a role without auditioning,” studio president and head producer Kevin Feige says over email of the decision. “Anthony was one of those rare cases.”

Wilson was little more than a sidekick, but Mackie made him into something special: confidant, comic relief, a superpowerless Air Force veteran who could hold his ground against everything the MCU threw at him. Whether or not Marvel’s designs for the role were always star-spangled, it was only five years before Evans gave him the surprise of his life. “I inadvertently was the one who got to tell him that he was going to be Captain America. I didn’t know that he didn’t know,” Evans says, recalling a gathering he hosted at his house during the filming of _Endgame._ Mackie was the first to show up. “I said, ‘Man, isn’t that scene so beautiful? I love it so much and I’m so happy for you.’ ” He was referring to the moment where the elderly Rogers hands Wilson the shield for good, except Mackie had no clue what he was talking about. Evans runs upstairs, grabs the _Endgame_ script, and hands it to him. “I got to sit there and watch him read it,” he says. “And he was just so happy.”

In the few years since Mackie accepted the shield, he’s become an on-set leader. It’s important to him, he says, to create space for young actors of color—to make sure they have what they need to succeed, too. “What I learned from him is the importance of sending the elevator back down,” says [Danny Ramirez](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a36190064/danny-ramirez-falcon-winter-soldier-finale-joaquin-torres-top-gun-maverick-interview/), who takes over the Falcon mantle in the upcoming film. It can be dispiriting when industry top billing all looks the same, Ramirez admits, before wondering just how deeply that might have affected Mackie over the years. “It’s hard for someone like Anthony, who is far more talented than so many of his peers.”

In 2008, after years of city living, Mackie was feeling adrift. A trip home showed him what he was missing. He woke up at 5:00 A.M. to fish with his friends. Seven hours later, he was at his uncle’s house, trading a cooler for a golf bag. They spent all afternoon on the course, came back, and ate the fish he caught that morning. Potato salad, peas, cornbread. Eventually, Mackie looked at his uncle and said, “Why don’t I live here?”

“Exactly, stupid,” the uncle deadpanned.

Trying to maintain his foothold in Hollywood while also refusing to live in L. A. or New York was an obvious gamble, but he returned to New York and packed up his car.

“Moving to New Orleans slowed my career in a way,” he says. “But it also gave me the peace of mind and the confidence, being outside of the business, that I can bring a natural humanity into my roles and the things that I do.”

Now he’s even bringing the roles to New Orleans—count Netflix movie _We Have a Ghost_ and Peacock TV series _Twisted Metal_ as Mackie-led projects that he brought home with him. “Anthony is a real caretaker on set,” says his _Twisted Metal_ costar Stephanie Beatriz. “He is constantly checking in on the crew. It’s something that I’ve watched people that I admire in the industry do—Andre Braugher, Ted Danson, Anthony—they really take care of and pay attention to the things that they love. And one of the things that Anthony loves is New Orleans.”

There was a moment in my interview with Russo when we wondered aloud if Anthony Mackie’s defining performance hadn’t happened yet—and what his next twenty-five years might hold. “I feel like he has so many more colors in him than you have seen,” he says. Well, Mackie voices a robot named Herman in the Russo brothers’ _The_ _Electric State_, on Netflix March 14. He finished filming season 2 of _Twisted Metal_, a (rare) successful video game adaptation. He also teased a legal thriller reminiscent of _A Time to Kill,_ in which he’ll star alongside man of the moment Glen Powell. Consider Mackie’s cameo (as himself!) in [Seth Rogen’s Apple TV+ comedy _The Studio_](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a62950584/the-studio-apple-cast-news/) appointment viewing this spring. At some point, we’ll see him star in the Rupert Wyatt–directed _Desert Warrior,_ Saudi Arabia’s massive foray into blockbuster filmmaking. He is also fighting to make a biopic of the civil-rights hero Claudette Colvin—and wants to star in the [upcoming Roberto Clemente biopic.](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/roberto-clemente-biopic-lawsuit-1235911068/) “I met Roberto Clemente Jr.,” Mackie says. “And I told him I wanted to play his dad.”

The waitress-slash-best-friend returns. She asks Mackie where, in the wide world of Anthony Mackie haunts in New Orleans, he’s planning to bring me. His deflection tells me he’s either making this entire day’s agenda up on the fly—or he knows exactly where we’re going.

“That’s the question,” he says. “You brought it up.”

Another interruption. Turns out, the day’s final stop is Half Moon, where no one—not even the Chihuahua—cares that Captain America walked in for a Crown and Coke. Outside, on the patio, is a different question. Past the fence facing the street is a dude slowly driving by in a white car. “_YEEEEEEEEAAAAAAHHH!_ YOU’RE THE MAN!” Mackie smiles and sticks his fist straight in the air. Dude drives away.

We agree that this intrusion was a good one.

On the way over to the bar, I asked Mackie if what he told me the week earlier—To whom much is worked for, much is what?—was indeed a rhetorical question. “It’s always assumed when you’re successful that somebody gave you something,” he explains. “We’re taught when we become successful to be humble or to not be self-celebratory. But maybe you deserve that pat on the back.”

Something changes in Mackie almost as soon as he lights his cigar. Crown, Coke, Blue Moon, plastic cups, the Connecticut. The one single guy at a neighboring table in a white tank, minding himself. This place knows Anthony Mackie, and Anthony Mackie knows this place. We cheers with our plastic cups—he taps his against the table, takes a drink, and tells me an especially batshit Anthony Mackie Story about the time two underage girls knocked out the bartender because no one would serve them a drink. “She runs outside, throws a bottle through the window, walks home,” he says, zero inflection in his voice. “Craziest shit in the world.”

We have nowhere to go but up from there, so we estimate the expiration date on his MCU tenure. “I give it a solid ten years,” Mackie says. “You have the two Avengers movies, you have hopefully another Captain America, and then random plug-and-plays: Oh, Spider-Man! Oh, Fantastic Four! What are you doing here? But you never know. I mean, I don’t want to be a sixty-year-old Captain America.”

Mackie feels the absence of his parents; his father was displaced by Hurricane Katrina and died soon after. Even though he says they made him stronger, faster, and better so that he could reach this moment, it pains him that they aren’t here to witness it. “I remember when we did the _Infinity War_ premiere, [Winston Duke](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a41889269/winston-duke-black-panther-wakanda-forever-interview/) brought his mom. I spent the whole party with her, just chilling and talking. And she was the sweetest little lady.” Mackie realized later what that was: a man living out his wildest dreams and sharing it with the person closest to him.

But it’s not just a personal victory that he feels at this moment. Captain America has long been held as an idealized version of the American man. That he should now be Black onscreen—for young Black kids everywhere to see—might just be the most important thing he’s ever done. In New York, Mackie was quick to point out that his 2021 [Disney+ series](https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/g37894343/best-marvel-tv-shows-disney-plus/), _Falcon and the Winter Soldier,_ arrived as America was still reeling from the murder of George Floyd. There’s a moment in the finale when a government official picks a moral fight with Wilson—and his rebuke is astounding. “I’m a Black man carrying the stars and stripes,” Wilson says. “What don’t I understand? Every time I pick this up, I know there are millions of people out there who are gonna hate me for it.”

In just his short time as Cap, Mackie has honorably thrust modern issues of race and power into stories that are largely seen as popcorn fare. It’s added a new layer of expectation to the role. “It’s a heavy weight to realize people look up to you,” he says, “because how much of yourself do you allow those people to see? You’re not allowed to be human. That’s one thing I can’t wrap my brain around. What is that line?”

At some point during our time together, I ask Mackie about the nearly yearlong break he took from Hollywood after filming _The Hurt Locker_. “_The Hurt Locker_ was one of those moments that I talked about where I’ve been looked over many times. That was a big one, because I was front and center with it—and I got punched in the face.”

_The Hurt Locker_’s climactic scene sees Mackie’s Sanborn and his partner, Renner’s Staff Sergeant William James, attempt—and fail—to save the life of an unwilling suicide bomber. Driving back to base, Sanborn is caked in sweat, eyes welling up, sinking deeper and deeper into grief. Mackie then delivers the pain, futility, and tragedy of war in a single monologue. It’s a wonder how the Academy found five better performances than his in 2010. The snub stung—still does—but Mackie had a much deeper wound to recover from. “The idea of death . . . I couldn’t shake it,” he says. “I couldn’t stop thinking about the inevitable. That character’s demise became my reality, almost.” He still can’t watch it. “It became too much to deal with, and I had never experienced that as a man.”

He healed: “It’s the last time I bought into the idea of someone else giving me a reward for my work. So I reward myself for my work.”

Eventually, the Connecticut is a nub between his fingers, the smoke is gone, and we’re sitting outside with empty plastic cups.

“I have nothing to do except find a fucking Christmas tree,” he says of his afternoon. He’s learned the hard way that young kids and tricked-out trees don’t mix well and these days hangs ornaments only on the top half. “Christmas is great for everybody except the person who’s paying,” Mackie says, laughing. “When I look under the tree, there are no gifts for me!”

You deserve a Christmas, I suggest.

Mackie agrees: “I deserve a Christmas.”

Doesn’t he?
