WHIH Interview with Scott Lang
------------------------------

Christine Everhart (**Leslie Bibb,** reprising her role as a reporter from the Iron Man movies) talks one-on-one with cyber-criminal Scott Lang via video interview from San Quentin prison. This tells us a bit about the Lang character's backstory, before the events that happen in Ant-Man.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Darren Cross interview teases Hank Pym's ties to SHIELD and an upcoming announcement coming from Pam Tech which could have huge implications.

**The original story from July 8th written by Russ Fischer follows:**

Marvel is continuing to fill in the backstory of **_Ant-Man_**'s primary character Scott Lang via viral videos.

This one doesn't feature actor **Paul Rudd** other than in still photos, but it does tell how he came to be in jail, and helps position his criminal acts as something akin to those of a Robin Hood type character rather than the selfish acts of a sociopath. It's a more concentrated dose of backstory than you'll get in the movie, really, and it also has a few fun little touches for fans. Check out the [continuing](https://www.slashfilm.com/ant-man-viral/)_Ant-Man_ viral backstory below.

This is the basic story of Lang's imprisonment:

> Scott Lang, former systems engineer at VistaCorp, was arrested three years ago for stealing nearly $4 million from his employer and for a subsequent property damage rampage, which, among other things, claimed the prized Bentley of VistaCorp's CEO.

But the video will give you a lot more.

First up, yeah, that's **Leslie Bibb** returning as Christine Everhart, a character last seen in _Iron Man 2_. She'll be in _Captain America: Civil War_, too.The opening of this video also points towards the conflict that will make up the major storyline in _Civil War_. And there are some Marvel Studios easter eggs in the scrolling chyron below the main video footage, featuring minor updates on characters such as Jane Foster and Baron Strucker.

Directed by**Peyton Reed**,_Ant-Man_ arrives in theaters**July 17, 2015**.
