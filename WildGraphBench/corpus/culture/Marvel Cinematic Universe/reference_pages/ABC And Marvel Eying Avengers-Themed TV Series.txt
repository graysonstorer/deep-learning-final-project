I’ve learned that Marvel’s TV division is in conversation with[ABC](http://www.deadline.com/?s=ABC) and ABC Studios about doing a drama series in the Avengers world. I hear that the connection to the _Avengers_ franchise would be light as the project is expected to be set in the universe and feature some of its themes and feel, but may not include any characters from Joss Whedon’s blockbuster. I hear the project is in a nascent stage, described as “a kernel of an idea,” with a number of scenarios being explored, including a high-concept cop show. It is unclear whether Whedon would be involved in the TV project, referred to as _Shield_. Marvel has already given the Avengers the animated treatment with Disney XD’s _The Avengers: Earth’s Mightiest Heroes_ and the upcoming _[Avengers Assemble.](http://www.deadline.com/tag/avengers-assemble/)_

**Related:**[Comic-Con: Marvel TV Previews New ‘Avengers Assemble’](comic-con: Marvel TV Previews New %E2%80%98Avengers Assemble,%E2%80%99 %E2%80%98Hulk & Agents of S.M.A.S.H.%E2%80%99 & More Joss Whedon%E2%80%99s %E2%80%98Astonishing X-Men%E2%80%99)

Establishing a primetime foothold has been a priority for Disney-owned Marvel. The company has developed several projects for ABC Studios over the last couple of years, one of which, a _Hulk_ series, is still in the works. Search is under way for a new writer to pen the project.

*   All of their proposed TV series should be set in the unified MCU. This shouldn’t be a special case. Comment by Tucker — Friday July 27, 2012 @ 5:15pm PDT[Reply to this post](https://www.deadline.com/2012/07/abc-marvel-avengers-themed-tv-series/#comments-form-wrap)

*   Wait…so, it would be set in the Marvel Universe? Why are they saying Avengers universe? Alias (not JJ’s) would be a cool adaption. Or maybe something shield related? Comment by Cody — Friday July 27, 2012 @ 5:17pm PDT[Reply to this post](https://www.deadline.com/2012/07/abc-marvel-avengers-themed-tv-series/#comments-form-wrap) 
    *   Yeah! It seems strange that they would drop development on “AKA Jessica Jones” when it would be such a perfect fit for this. Comment by steveo — Friday July 27, 2012 @ 6:32pm PDT[Reply to this post](https://www.deadline.com/2012/07/abc-marvel-avengers-themed-tv-series/#comments-form-wrap) 
    *   Because the Marvel universe includes all of their properties, such as the X-Men and Spider-Man, which aren’t currently available for a series like this. Hence “Avengers universe,” which includes pretty much everything else.

*   So maybe on SHIELD? Action-based would be cool, following some other SHIELD agents. Or even a midquel of sorts taking place in between the movies involving Clark Gregg’s character? I’m sure Cobie S. could guest star too Comment by Jared Munson — Friday July 27, 2012 @ 5:25pm PDT[Reply to this post](https://www.deadline.com/2012/07/abc-marvel-avengers-themed-tv-series/#comments-form-wrap) 
*   They could do it with SHIELD, or maybe something like a second-tier team, or West Coast Avengers. Perhaps even Avengers Academy? Comment by Glenn — Friday July 27, 2012 @ 5:51pm PDT[Reply to this post](https://www.deadline.com/2012/07/abc-marvel-avengers-themed-tv-series/#comments-form-wrap) 
*   The best part about this story is that they are already exploring turning it into a cop show. They may get really wild and consider focusing on Lawyers who represent superheroes or Doctors who treat the injured superheros.

    *   You mean like Heroes for Hire? Comment by Danny Rand — Friday July 27, 2012 @ 6:36pm PDT[Reply to this post](https://www.deadline.com/2012/07/abc-marvel-avengers-themed-tv-series/#comments-form-wrap) 
    *   They could always use Jennifer Walters, aka She-Hulk, who is a lawyer specializing in the legal problems of superheroes. Even though I dislike the cheesy She-Hulk character, Walters’ position as the champion of heroes in legal hot water opens up a lot of story possibilities.

*   Would anyone else just really love an Agents of SHIELD series with Clark Gregg? Comment by Emily Anarchy — Friday July 27, 2012 @ 6:22pm PDT[Reply to this post](https://www.deadline.com/2012/07/abc-marvel-avengers-themed-tv-series/#comments-form-wrap) 
    *   I would! Before The Avengers came out, Jeph Loeb said that networks had approached Marvel with ideas for a SHIELD series starring Gregg. But then they shortsightedly killed Coulson off (totally Whedon’s call, no matter what Feige says). Unless they retcon Coulson’s death away or make the series a sort of prequel to the films it won’t fly. Damn!

*   “West Coast Avengers” anyone? “Great Lakes Avengers”? Comment by elf — Friday July 27, 2012 @ 6:28pm PDT[Reply to this post](https://www.deadline.com/2012/07/abc-marvel-avengers-themed-tv-series/#comments-form-wrap) 
*   I hope Marvel regains the rights to Daredevil since Fox is on the verge of losing the license. That character would be perfect for TV: a street-level character that can exist within, but on the edge of the established Marvel Cinematic universe, with powers and abilities that should be easy to accomplish on a TV budget. Not to mention his day job is a lawyer, so they could utilized the legal aspects as well.

    *   Fox only has the rights for Daredevil FILMS. A TV series can still be developed my Marvel if they desired. Comment by Feedback — Monday July 30, 2012 @ 9:11pm PDT[Reply to this post](https://www.deadline.com/2012/07/abc-marvel-avengers-themed-tv-series/#comments-form-wrap)

*   Hollywood is truly out of ideas. Comment by Gene — Friday July 27, 2012 @ 7:29pm PDT[Reply to this post](https://www.deadline.com/2012/07/abc-marvel-avengers-themed-tv-series/#comments-form-wrap) 
*   They could do a drama like something set at The Daily Bugle or something similar to Busiek’s “Marvels’. It could be some sort of government based show and feature characters like Val Cooper and Henry Peter Gyrich. They have options but I have to agree ‘AKA Jessica Jones’ sounds like it would fit the bill. The article didn’t mention the ‘Mockingbird’ series in ABC Family or Cloak & Dagger. ABC is really missing the boat here. Comment by JJ — Friday July 27, 2012 @ 8:23pm PDT[Reply to this post](https://www.deadline.com/2012/07/abc-marvel-avengers-themed-tv-series/#comments-form-wrap) 
    *   A few months back ABC announced they took a pass on the AKA Jones series because the writer hired for it didn’t deliver the goods. That’s absolutely a Jeph Loeb failure since he was in charge of developing it. How inept do you have to be to fail to sell a series to your own network, which was eager to pick it up? That does not bode well for future projects.

*   Tie it into the films. Convince some of the bigger name actors to show up, at least briefly.

You know, you may convince Mark Ruffalo to do the HULK series. Maybe at 13 episodes a year. Then just do a bunch of environmental promo spots with him as part of the deal.

Do a SHIELD series. Use Clark Gregg somehow. Comment by Ryan — Friday July 27, 2012 @ 10:21pm PDT[Reply to this post](https://www.deadline.com/2012/07/abc-marvel-avengers-themed-tv-series/#comments-form-wrap) 
*   It’s based on “a kernel of an idea” huh? Why that’s about what most movies are based on these days! I say, start filming and add loud music and fighting robots whenever the script lags! Seriously though, take a hint from the BBC, find a good idea, make a miniseries, when you think of another, repeat. If you don’t like BBC, ask AMC.

*   They’ve been wanting to make a “Star Wars” TV show for years, the F/X are very expensive. ABC/Disney better be perpared to risk mega bucks on this, just because the movie was a hit it doesn’t mean this will, ask the people at FOX how well “Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chroincels” went.
