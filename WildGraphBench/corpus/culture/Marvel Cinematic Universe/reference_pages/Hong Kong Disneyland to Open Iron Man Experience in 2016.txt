Marvel Entertainment

"Iron Man 3"

The attraction will feature the Marvel hero fighting alien invaders in the streets of Hong Kong.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HONG KONG – Disney has signed up box office sensation _Iron Man_ for a new themed area at Hong Kong Disneyland, with the Marvel character set to take to the skies over the city in 2016, said **Tom****Staggs**, chairman of Walt Disney Parks and Resorts.

The centerpiece of the new area is the Iron Man Experience, which will feature a storyline involving the blockbuster Marvel character flighting alien invaders in the skies and streets of Hong Kong.

The area, which also includes a photo-taking corner with Iron Man and a Marvel merchandise space, is set to open in late 2016.

“Combined with Toy Story Land, Grizzly Gulch and Mystic Point, this new themed area underscores commitment to and confidence in the continued growth of Hong Kong Disneyland,” Staggs said.

The new areas have boosted the size of Hong Kong Disneyland by 25 percent.

The popularity of Tony Stark and his alter ego has been proven in Hong Kong, with the third installment of the _Iron_ _Man_ franchise raking in over $12.9 million (HK$100 million) early this year, making it the highest-grossing film of all time in the territory behind **James Cameron**'s _Avatar_ and _Titanic_.

[**PHOTOS:'Iron Man 3' Tour: Robert Downey Jr. Travels the World**](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/gallery/iron-man-3-tour-robert-435880)

The _Iron Man_ factor is set to prove a hit with mainland Chinese visitors to the park. _Iron Man 3_ took more than $160 million in China.

The Hong Kong Iron Man area will be situated in Tomorrowland, where the iron suits and other Stark innovations will be displayed.

An Iron Man exhibit, "Iron Man Tech Presented by Stark Industries," opened at Disneyland in Anaheim, California, and an Iron Man monorail was launched in Walt Disney World in Orlando in early 2013.

John Carter, the pioneering African-American film editor who worked on _The Heartbreak Kid_, _Paper Lion_ and _Barbershop_ and shaped powerful documentaries about Martin Luther King Jr. and Solomon Northup, has died. He was 95.

Carter died Aug. 13 at his home in White Plains, New York, his daughter Carolyn told _The Hollywood Reporter_.

The first African-American to join the American Cinema Editors society, Carter co-edited the George Plimpton football tale _Paper Lion_ (1968); _Lean on Me_ (1989), starring Morgan Freeman as real-life high school principal Joe Clark; _The Karate Kid Part III_ (1989), one of three features he did with director John G. Avildsen; and _Men of Honor_ (2000), about African-American Navy diver Carl Brashear.

His editing skills also were on display in the Marlon Brando and George C. Scott mystery _The Formula_ (1980); in _The Heartbreak Kid_ (1973) and _Mikey and Nicky_ (1976), both directed by Elaine May; and in the [Ice Cube](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/ice-cube/) comedies _Friday_ (1995) and _Barbershop_ (2002).

“John Carter was a beautiful spirit, and it could be felt and seen through his work,” director Bill Duke, who partnered with him on _Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit_, _The Cemetery Club_, _Deep Cover_ and TV’s _The Killing Floor_, told _THR_. “His craft and spirit influenced my films in a very positive way.”

Following the assassination of King on April 4, 1968, producer Ely Landau approached Sidney Lumet (he had produced the director’s _Long Day’s Journey Into Night_ and _The Pawnbroker_) and Joseph L. Mankiewicz (_All About Eve_) to begin work on chronicling the life of the slain civil rights leader. (It would be Lumet’s only foray into the documentary genre and just the second film that Carter would edit.)

The three-hour _King: A Filmed Record … Montgomery to Memphis_ exhaustively documents MLK’s life from the 1955 bus boycott in Alabama to his assassination, and features appearances by Paul Newman, Brando, Burt Lancaster and James Earl Jones reciting verse for the camera. The “I Have a Dream” speech is shown in its entirety.

The documentary, which Carter and co-editor Lora Hays cut by hand, begins with an emotional introduction by Harry Belafonte, a close friend of King: “And be thankful that the Lord let such a man touch our lives, even if it were for only a little while.”

_Montgomery to Memphis_ screened as a “one-time only” nationwide event in 1,000 theaters on March 24, 1970, received an Oscar nomination for best documentary feature and in 1999 was enshrined into the National Film Registry.

Years before _12 Years a Slave_ won the Oscar for best picture, Northup’s 1853 memoir was adapted by renowned African-American photojournalist and director Gordon Parks for the 1984 PBS telefilm _Solomon Northup’s Odyssey_.

The _Shaft_ helmer had come out of retirement and hired Carter to edit the film, which the National Endowment for the Humanities said “helped push one of the darkest periods from America’s past into the public consciousness.”

In 1982, Carter had edited another PBS production (co-produced by WPBT), _A House Divided: Denmark Vesey’s Rebellion_. That focused on the true story of a carpenter and former slave (played by Yaphet Kotto) who planned to seize the city of Charleston, South Carolina, and stage a rebellion.

Carter’s final work for PBS was 1985’s _Charlotte Forten’s Mission: Experiment in Freedom_, starring Melba Moore. Forten was an African-American abolitionist and educator who taught former slaves in South Carolina.

Carter was born in Newark, New Jersey, on Sept. 22, 1922. After a stint in the U.S. Army as a staff sergeant trained at the New York Institute of Photography, he took an apprenticeship with the Signal Corps Pictorial Center.

Carter was hired by CBS in 1956 and became the first African-American editor for network television in New York. He gained experience in CBS’ documentary unit before creating his own production company, John Carter Associates.

In 1972, he received a BAFTA nomination for editing _Taking Off_, Milos Forman’s first American film.

Carter also collaborated with Tyler Perry on _Madea’s Family Reunion_(2006), Martin Lawrence’s _A Thin Line Between Love and Hate_ (1996), Alec Baldwin’s _Shortcut to Happiness_ (2003) and German director Bernhard Sinkel’s four-part miniseries _Hemingway_. And he was one of three editors on the Eddie Murphy comedy _Boomerang_ (1992).

Survivors include his wife of 63 years, Carole; daughters Victoria and Carolyn; and son John. A memorial service will take place at 11 a.m. Saturday at Grace Episcopal Church in White Plains.
