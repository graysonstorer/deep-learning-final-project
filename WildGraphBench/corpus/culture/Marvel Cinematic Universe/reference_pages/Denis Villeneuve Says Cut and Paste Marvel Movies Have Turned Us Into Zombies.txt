Timothée Chalamet, “Dune”

Legendary Entertainment

Another day, another auteur weighing in on the artistic substance of the [Marvel](https://www.indiewire.com/t/marvel/) Cinematic Universe. Almost in time for the two-year anniversary of when Martin Scorsese [compared Marvel movies to theme parks](https://www.indiewire.com/2019/10/martin-scorsese-marvel-movies-not-cinema-theme-parks-1202178747/), “[Dune](https://www.indiewire.com/t/dune/)” director [Denis Villeneuve](https://www.indiewire.com/t/denis-villeneuve/) has sounded off on what he thinks about many of the “cut and paste” Marvel movies dominating movie theaters in recent years. Villeneuve spoke to [El Mundo](https://amp.elmundo.es/cultura/cine/2021/09/15/6140b623fdddff11618b4602.html) (via [The Direct](https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-denis-villeneuve-movies-zombies)) about the MCU, and why big-budget movies are still relevant when they’re coming from master storytellers.

“Perhaps the problem is that we are in front of too many Marvel movies that are nothing more than a ‘cut and paste’ of others,” Villeneuve said. “Perhaps these types of movies have turned us into zombies a bit… But big and expensive movies of great value there are many today. I don’t feel capable of being pessimistic at all.”

The Academy Award-nominated Villeneuve has yet to step into the Marvel Cinematic Universe himself, though he has franchise hopes for his upcoming “Dune” adaptation, for which he plans to make a sequel depending on the success of the sci-fi epic in theaters and on HBO Max October 22.

Villeneuve went on to say, “Just think of the golden age of Hollywood to see that commercial films can make a different artistic proposal and, therefore, political. I have never felt like a loss or an impediment to have a generous budget to do what I wanted to do. Upside down. Who said that a movie on a big budget can’t be artistically relevant at the same time? I am currently thinking of people like Christopher Nolan or Alfonso Cuarón.”

Villeneuve also recently told [French outlet Premiere](https://www.premiere.fr/Cinema/News-Cinema/Denis-Villeneuve--Avec-Dune-j-ai-essaye-de-faire-le-film-le-plus-populaire-possible), “If we’re talking about Marvel, the thing is, all these films are made from the same mold. Some filmmakers can add a little color to it, but they’re all cast in the same factory. It doesn’t take anything away from the movies, but they are formatted.”

As for the future of “Dune: Part Two,” Villeneuve [recently said](https://www.indiewire.com/2021/09/denis-villenueve-filmed-two-dune-movies-once-1234664271/), “If such a thing as ‘Dune: Part Two’ happens, I will say that it’s going to be an insane playground for me. … It’s going to be just like pure cinematic pleasure for the second part. I don’t want to speak for everybody on the team, but I will say that we really created on this movie a feeling of family and to re-unify everybody again together, that would be paradise.”

Insiders recently [told Variety](https://variety.com/2021/film/box-office/dune-hbo-max-release-1235062312) that the success of the movie on HBO Max, and not just the box office, will be a deciding factor in whether “Dune: Part Two” gets the green light from Warner Bros.

### Do Not Sell My Personal Information

This page enables California residents to opt-out of sharing of information that may be a sale of personal information under the CCPA. Please review all of your choices below. You can also review our [Privacy Policy.](https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#california)

**Contact Information & Subscription Information**

 We sell or license certain information, such as contact information or subscription information, to third parties to provide you with offers and promotions and opportunities that may be of interest to you. If you would like to opt out of the sale of this information, please use this [webform](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/e65b3c4c-fa81-40d2-9df0-c7e99bf5f900/433ac076-21f3-4342-b391-a4d7d631cd3f.html) or call our automated line at (877) 365-3500.

**Opt Out of Advertising Cookies**

 PMC and our advertising partners use cookies and other technologies to collect and share certain information such as your usage activity to deliver ads that are more relevant to you on PMC and other sites or apps. This may be considered a "sale” under the CCPA. You can opt out of this type of sharing by us using the toggle above. When the toggle is enabled, targeted advertising cookies are on. This opt out does not affect other cookies such as strictly necessary or essential cookies. For more information about cookies please see our [Privacy Policy](https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#california).

 You must exercise this choice every PMC site and on each device and browser where you want your choice to apply. If you clear cookies, you must opt out again. You may still receive ads from us (including contextual or based on our own data about you). We will still share some information with those of our partners who function as our service providers, such as to help us measure ad effectiveness, control the frequency, delivery and security of ads, and conduct analytics. This will not opt you out of the use of previously collected and shared information or all interest-based advertising (such as that conducted on other sites). 

 You can also update your browser settings or visit www.aboutads.info/choices to opt-out of certain uses of cookies for advertising purposes. 

 Our downstream partners who are not service providers may re-sell this information. You can request to opt out of such activity by clicking [here](https://www.iabprivacy.com/optout.html) to see a list of participants in the IAB (some of which are our partners) and submitting an opt out request on each entity’s site. Even if you opt out through this link, you will still see ads.

- [x] Strictly Necessary Cookies 

These cookies are necessary for the website to function and cannot be switched off in our systems. They are usually only set in response to actions made by you which amount to a request for services, such as setting your privacy preferences, logging in or filling in forms. You can set your browser to block or alert you about these cookies, but some parts of the site will not then work. These cookies do not store any personally identifiable information.

#### Sale of Personal Data

- [x] Sale of Personal Data 

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information to third parties. These cookies collect information for analytics and to personalize your experience with targeted ads. You may exercise your right to opt out of the sale of personal information by using this toggle switch. If you opt out we will not be able to offer you personalised ads and will not hand over your personal information to any third parties. Additionally, you may contact our legal department for further clarification about your rights as a California consumer by using this Exercise My Rights link.

If you have enabled privacy controls on your browser (such as a plugin), we have to take that as a valid request to opt-out. Therefore we would not be able to track your activity through the web. This may affect our ability to personalize ads according to your preferences.
