SEGA just announced the voice talent behind the upcoming (and totally movie based ) game [_The Incredible Hulk_](http://www.joystiq.com/tag/the-incredible-hulk) and, wouldn't you know, the actors from the movie are playing their video game roles. Odd. Among those listed are stars like Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, Tim Blake Nelson and William Hurt who will all lend their voices and physical likeness to _The Incredible Hulk_ video game. You can read the completely complete press release after the break. We also figured it would be rather humorous to point out the glaring typo that was present in the press release's subject line that read "S EGA ANNOUNCES VOICE TALENT FOR THE INCREDIBLE HULKT VIDEO GAME AND RELEASES NEW SCREENSHOTS". A mistake like that would make the "HULKT" green with anger.

**SEGA ANNOUNCES VOICE TALENT FOR THE INCREDIBLE HULK™ VIDEO GAME**

_A-list Hollywood talent crush their way into upcoming videogame based on the action-thriller_

 SAN FRANCISCO & LONDON (April 9, 2008) - Marvel Entertainment, Inc., SEGA® of America, Inc and SEGA® Europe Ltd. today announced that all prominent cast members from the upcoming action-thriller from Universal Pictures and Marvel Studios, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, will also lend their voices and likeness to the video game of the same name, slated to release with the film in June 2008. Edward Norton, Liv Tyler, Tim Roth, Tim Blake Nelson and William Hurt will all take part in the game as their respective characters. Based on the film and the popular comic book series created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, THE INCREDIBLE HULK™ is being developed by Edge of Reality and published by SEGA for next-generation consoles and the PC. 

 SEGA brings the film's A-list actors to the game to create a more authentic experience. Edward Norton (Fight Club, The Italian Job, The Illusionist) plays scientist Bruce Banner, a man desperately seeking to rid himself of the unbridled force of rage within him: The Hulk. Liv Tyler (The Lord of the Rings trilogy, The Strangers) is Dr. Betty Ross, Banner's love interest, while Tim Roth (Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction) voices Emil Blonsky (alter ego of The Hulk's archenemy, The Abomination). Tim Blake Nelson (Syriana, Meet the Fockers) portrays Dr. Samuel Sterns, and William Hurt (Into the Wild, The Village) plays General Thaddeus "Thunderbolt" Ross, the man who wants to capture The Hulk and brutally exploit his power. 

 Fast-paced and action-packed, the blockbuster franchise and comic book saga will unfold for the first time on next-generation platforms, as Banner scours the planet trying to find anything to help him fight his involuntary rage. Take the role of one of Marvel®'s most powerful Super Heroes in THE INCREDIBLE HULK™, an intensely realistic third-person action video game. Gamers can demolish anything in their path, including lampposts, passing cars and even buildings. The fury-fueled game also features key moments from the film, as well as additional plotlines and characters from THE INCREDIBLE HULK universe. Players crash through New York City, battling gigantic enemies amidst soaring skyscrapers in a massive open world.
