Worried you missed your chance to help the Avengers save the world? Don’t worry, because the transmission has just come in and _[**Avengers: Damage Control**](https://www.marvel.com/articles/culture-lifestyle/first-look-avengers-damage-control-the-void)_ has been extended at select [The VOID](https://www.thevoid.com/) locations through the end of 2019!

_Avengers: Damage Control_ takes us to a Wakandan Outreach Center, where [Shuri](https://www.marvel.com/characters/shuri) (Letitia Wright) is testing her latest invention: Emergency Response Suits, which are a blend of Wakandan and Stark Industries technology. And no sooner are you suited up that a long-lost foe returns, and you’re required to join the rest of the Avengers in stopping him!

As you fight alongside the Avengers, guests will [find themselves completely immersed](https://www.marvel.com/articles/culture-lifestyle/avengers-damage-control-things-we-learned) in familiar Marvel locations, while encountering real-world elements like heat, wind, vibrations, and smells as you travel to the Damage Control facility. If you’ve ever wanted to be a hero yourself, now’s your chance!

_Avengers: Damage Control is currently at multiple The VOID locations, with dates now available through the end of December 2019. [Get Tickets now](https://www.thevoid.com/dimensions/marvel-avengers-vr/)!_
