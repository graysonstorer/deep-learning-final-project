There was an idea.

A few years ago in Atlanta, [Scarlett Johansson](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/black-widow-scarlett-johansson-florence-pugh-disney-plus-1234975907/) was at dinner with [Marvel Studios](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/marvel-studios/) boss [Kevin Feige](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/kevin-feige/) and development executive Brad Winderbaum. Johansson was shooting _Avengers: Endgame_, which featured the death of Natasha Romanoff, the hero she’d played since 2010’s _Iron Man 2_. Even so, a [Black Widow](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/t/black-widow/) stand-alone was something the team had long wanted. The question now, was how?

“Every one of these movies starts from a single conversation,” Winderbaum recalled of that dinner. “We were tossing around ideas of what it could be. And it just launched like a rocket.”

_Black_ _Widow_, debuting July 9, sees Natasha reunite with her adoptive family for an adventure tied to their mysterious past. Johansson served as an executive producer on _Black Widow_, making her the first Avenger to hold that title on a Marvel movie.

“I think she did as much work in front of the camera as behind the camera,” Winderbaum told _The Hollywood Reporter_ at a _Black Widow_ fan event in Hollywood on June 29. “She was fundamental in supporting [director] Cate Shortland and supporting the production and really helping us craft the story.”

_Black Widow_ enters a world the Marvel team couldn’t have imagined a few short years ago. A global pandemic swept the world and delayed _Black Widow_‘s release date a year, while pandemic pressures are seeing the project hit Disney+ day-and-date. The film also comes as Marvel juggles both movies and its new Disney+ streaming series, giving MCU talent even more places they might pop up. (Florence Pugh, who plays Natasha’s sister, Yelena, [is already set to appear in a Marvel streaming project](https://variety.com/2020/tv/news/hawkeye-disney-plus-florence-pugh-vera-farmiga-cast-1234845371/).)

In the past, Marvel made headlines for expansive deals that saw Samuel L. Jackson [sign on for nine pictures](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i57845f198f95ed938a79d4a806b64e68) in 2009, or Chris Evans and others ink six-picture pacts. But Feige says those types of deals are not the norm for Marvel these days.

“That got a lot of attention way back when, with I think Scarlett, and [Chris] Hemsworth and Evans and Sam Jackson. It varies now,” Feige told _THR_ when asked if the studio is making sweeping talent deals for a specific number of streaming and movie appearances.

Feige noted that he “would throw theme park attractions” into the list of things the studio makes talent deals for.

“It varies, project to project, cast to cast,” said Feige. “Really, what we want are people that come in, are excited to be in the universe, are excited at the opportunity to do more things, as opposed to being locked into contractual obligations.”

Pugh, David Harbour and Rachel Weisz are among _Black Widow_‘s Marvel newcomers joining Johansson in the MCU. The quartet has major chemistry, something director Shortland helped develop with rehearsals before filming, including for a key family dinner scene.

“This was the first time they were all together, and that’s big energy at that table,” recalled screenwriter Eric Pearson, who says the rehearsals informed his writing. “I got to feed off of that. All of them saying, ‘I want to do this, I want to do that.’ It was overwhelming. A little intimidating.”

In a change from the comics, Harbour’s Red Guardian — the Soviet Union’s answer to Captain America — is a father figure, rather than a romantic interest, for Natasha.

“We needed to complete the family, and that’s where Red Guardian came in as the paternal figure,” said co-producer Brian Chapek. “David is hilarious. He has a great new spin on a new character in this world, and hopefully we will see more at some point.”

For Feige, _Black Widow_ was a chance to show both Natasha, and even previous Marvel movies, in a new light.

“I look forward to people watching this film and then rewatching _Avengers 1_, _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_, and certainly _Infinity War_ and seeing how her actions are informed by her past that’s revealed,” said Feige.

As for Johansson’s MCU future, the actor has not signaled whether she’ll be back for more. Perhaps comic books, in which anything is possible, can provide a clue.

“‘Maybe there will be more down the road’ — [is the answer] comics have taught us,” said Feige. “Anything could be the answer to that question.”

_Black Widow_ is in theaters and on Disney+ Premier Access July 9.

This page enables California residents to opt-out of sharing of information that may be a sale of personal information under the CCPA. Please review all of your choices below. You can also review our [Privacy Policy.](https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#california)

**Contact Information & Subscription Information**

 We sell or license certain information, such as contact information or subscription information, to third parties to provide you with offers and promotions and opportunities that may be of interest to you. If you would like to opt out of the sale of this information, please use this [webform](https://privacyportal-cdn.onetrust.com/dsarwebform/e65b3c4c-fa81-40d2-9df0-c7e99bf5f900/433ac076-21f3-4342-b391-a4d7d631cd3f.html) or call our automated line at (877) 365-3500.

**Opt Out of Advertising Cookies**

 PMC and our advertising partners use cookies and other technologies to collect and share certain information such as your usage activity to deliver ads that are more relevant to you on PMC and other sites or apps. This may be considered a "sale” under the CCPA. You can opt out of this type of sharing by us using the toggle above. When the toggle is enabled, targeted advertising cookies are on. This opt out does not affect other cookies such as strictly necessary or essential cookies. For more information about cookies please see our [Privacy Policy](https://pmc.com/privacy-policy/#california).

 You must exercise this choice every PMC site and on each device and browser where you want your choice to apply. If you clear cookies, you must opt out again. You may still receive ads from us (including contextual or based on our own data about you). We will still share some information with those of our partners who function as our service providers, such as to help us measure ad effectiveness, control the frequency, delivery and security of ads, and conduct analytics. This will not opt you out of the use of previously collected and shared information or all interest-based advertising (such as that conducted on other sites). 

 You can also update your browser settings or visit www.aboutads.info/choices to opt-out of certain uses of cookies for advertising purposes. 

 Our downstream partners who are not service providers may re-sell this information. You can request to opt out of such activity by clicking [here](https://www.iabprivacy.com/optout.html) to see a list of participants in the IAB (some of which are our partners) and submitting an opt out request on each entity’s site. Even if you opt out through this link, you will still see ads.
