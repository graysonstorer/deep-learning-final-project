[_Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._](http://screencrush.com/tags/agents-of-s-h-i-e-l-d/) may not have [_Agent Carter_](http://screencrush.com/tags/agent-carter/) to tide us over until the 2017 return, but a more modern agent will instead slingshot into her own title. [Natalia Cordova-Buckley’s “Yo-Yo” Rodriguez](http://screencrush.com/agents-of-shield-slingshot-natalie-cordova-buckley/) will star in her own _Slingshot_ digital series, launching as early as next Tuesday.

_S.H.I.E.L.D._ revealed the surprise digital series at the tail end of Season 4's midwinter finale “[The Laws of Inferno Dynamics](http://screencrush.com/agents-of-shield-the-laws-of-inferno-dynamics-review/),” as well telegraphing in the promo above that the main series will pivot from a “[Ghost Rider](http://screencrush.com/tags/ghost-rider/)” subtitle to an “LMD” focus. As for _Slingshot_, the six-part series will [debut digitally on December 13](http://abc.go.com/shows/marvels-agents-of-shield-slingshot), while the full synopsis reads:

> Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot takes place shortly before the beginning of Marvel’s Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. Season 4. The digital series features Elena “Yo-Yo” Rodriguez, an Inhuman with the ability to move at super-speed. As a person with powers, she must sign the Sokovia Accords. However, the restrictions of the Accords are in direct conflict with a personal mission she’s desperate to fulfill, one that will test her abilities and will include tense encounters with S.H.I.E.L.D. team members.

It wouldn’t be the first time _S.H.I.E.L.D._ has tested the water for new series, between last year’s Bobbi and Hunter-centric [_Most Wanted_](http://screencrush.com/tags/most-wanted/), or [continued rumors of a _Ghost Rider_ spinoff](http://screencrush.com/agents-of-shield-ghost-rider-spinoff-gabriel-luna/), but will _Slingshot_ tide us over until 2017?

Watch the teaser again above, and stay tuned for more.
