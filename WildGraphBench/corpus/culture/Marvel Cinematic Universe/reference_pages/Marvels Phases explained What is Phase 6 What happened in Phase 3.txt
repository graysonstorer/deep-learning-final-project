# Marvel's 'Phases' explained: What is Phase 6? What happened in Phase 3?

Jump to:

*   [Phase 1 (2008 to 2012)](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a871567/marvel-phase-4-3-2-1-mcu/#phase-1-2008-to-2012)
*   [Phase 2 (2013 to 2015)](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a871567/marvel-phase-4-3-2-1-mcu/#phase-2-2013-to-2015)

*   [Phase 4 (2021 to 2022)](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a871567/marvel-phase-4-3-2-1-mcu/#phase-4-2021-to-2022)
*   [Phase 5 (2023 to 2025)](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a871567/marvel-phase-4-3-2-1-mcu/#phase-5-2023-to-2025)
*   [Phase 6 (2025 to 2027)](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a871567/marvel-phase-4-3-2-1-mcu/#phase-6-2025-to-2027)

_The Fantastic Four: First Steps_ has landed in cinemas, marking the start of [Phase 6](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a40742778/marvel-phase-6-movies-tv-shows-mcu/) which is the final phase of [The Multiverse Saga](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a40697238/avengers-5-6-phase-6-mcu-secret-wars/) in the [MCU](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a825774/marvel-cinematic-universe-in-chronological-order/).

But if that all sounds confusing, then we're here to help.

Phase 4 saw TV shows folded into the MCU's interconnected storylines more than ever before and this continued throughout Phase 5 and will continue into Phase 6, which will wrap up with an epic [_Avengers_ double bill](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a40697238/avengers-5-6-phase-6-mcu-secret-wars/).

That will complete the second of the MCU's two Sagas to date, both of which contain three Phases. If this sounds like a lot, we don't blame you as there's a lot to keep up from 17 years of Marvel storytelling.

So we're here to help with a (brief) overview of every Phase to date and what we can expect in the future.

What's it all about?
--------------------

Billionaire arms-dealing playboy Tony Stark has a life-changing experience in the desert and builds himself a hero suit. He fights a number of other tech-industry figures and meets Natasha Romanoff, aka Black Widow, and her SHIELD boss Nick Fury.

Earnest science guy Bruce Banner has a life-changing experience in the lab and becomes a confused, angry green giant.

Alien god-type guy Thor is exiled to Earth and learns about sacrifice in a life-changing experience before defeating some frost giants.

Weedy 1940s shrimp Steve Rogers has a life-changing serum pumped into him and becomes a Nazi-bashing – sorry, Hydra-bashing – demigod in blue tights, then gets frozen for 70-odd years before thawing out in 2011.

Together they all join forces (with some archery guy called Hawkeye who no-one really cares about) under Nick Fury's aegis to take down Thor's naughty half-brother Loki and his alien hordes.

New York bears the brunt of it.

There are also some moments [you may have forgotten about](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/the-avengers/feature/a854408/marvel-movies-mcu-phase-one-forgotten-details/)...

Phase 2 (2013 to 2015)

• _Iron Man 3_• _Thor: The Dark World_• _Captain America: The Winter Soldier_• _Guardians of the Galaxy_• _Avengers: Age of Ultron_• _Ant-Man_

What's it all about?
--------------------

A (briefly) traumatised Tony Stark steps back from the action, only to be drawn back into it by another tech-industry figure and his puppet villain, an actor called Trevor who was the toast of Croydon.

Thor has some trouble with a red McGuffin and some Dark Elves. Captain America is forced to turn against his own corrupt government when his old pal Bucky turns up as a brainwashed supersoldier.

The [Guardians of the Galaxy](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/guardians-of-the-galaxy/review/a586224/guardians-of-the-galaxy-review-marvel-goes-cosmic-with-chris-pratt/) are a bunch of alien ne'er-do-wells who have trouble with a purple McGuffin and the alien warlord Thanos, and we also meet petty criminal Scott Lang, who [inherits shrinking technology and becomes Ant-Man](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/ant-man/review/a654152/ant-man-review-paul-rudd-experiences-significant-shrinkage-in-a-hugely-entertaining-movie/).

But neither the Guardians nor Ant-Man have anything to do with the Avengers, who team up again to take down the cyber-consciousness Ultron, wrecking the country of Sokovia in the process.

What's it all about?
--------------------

The Big One. The Phase to end all Phases, until Phase 4.

We meet Doctor Strange. He's a surgeon who can do magic, and his real name actually is Doctor Strange. (Of course, if he were British, like the actor who plays him, he would be Mr Strange, FRCS.)

Captain America, his flying friend Falcon, Bucky, Ant-Man and Black Widow team up against Tony Stark, his buddy War Machine, his former cyber-butler Jarvis (now a demigod called Vision), Stark's teenage protégé [Spider-Man](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/spider-man/review/a832004/spider-man-homecoming-review-marvel-tom-holland/) and his new royal African friend [Black Panther](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a849407/black-panther-review/) in [a dispute over whether superheroes should answer to the world's governments or not](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a791330/captain-america-civil-war-review-the-most-grown-up-super-hero-movie-yet/).

From the scale of it and the size of the cast, you might think this is _Avengers 3_, by the way, but it isn't.

Cap's guys are variously captured or go into hiding, while [Thor and Hulk are busy battling Thor's sister](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/review/a840997/thor-ragnarok-review/), the goddess of death. They win, but fall foul of Thanos at the end (that guy again!).

The [Guardians have more fun in space unconnected to anything else](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/guardians-of-the-galaxy/review/a826461/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2-review/), until they meet up with Thor. [Everyone we have mentioned so far apart from Thanos teams up against Thanos](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/the-avengers/review/a855511/avengers-infinity-war-review-spoiler-free/), who is collecting all the [McGuffins](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a783217/marvel-infinity-stones-where-are-they/) in order to wipe out half of all life in the universe for [ill-considered reasons](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/the-avengers/feature/a855818/avengers-infinity-war-thanos-plot-death-criticism/).

THANOS (spoilers) WINS and kills half of all life in the universe.

[Captain Marvel crash-lands on Earth in the 1990s](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a26622222/captain-marvel-review/), meets Nick Fury and gives him a pager "for emergencies only", stops a Kree invasion and befriends the Skrulls.

The remaining [Avengers band together five years after the Snap to go on a time travel heist](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a27112255/avengers-endgame-review/) in order to undo the Snap and bring everyone back. They're successful, but 2014-Thanos decides to cause some mayhem, leading Tony Stark to sacrifice himself to defeat the Mad Titan once and for all. Black Widow dies too and Captain America gets super old.

Eight months later, [Peter Parker is trying to deal with the death of his mentor and have a European vacation](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a28181117/spider-man-far-from-home-review-tom-holland/). Fury doesn't let him, though, and teams him up with Mysterio to defeat the Elementals – only problem is that Mysterio is behind it all.

Spidey wins, but his identity is revealed to the world. Uh-oh.

What's it all about?
--------------------

Phase 4 mostly consisted of two things: bringing a [whole bunch of new characters](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a40677229/mcu-phase-4-new-characters/) into the MCU and introducing the concept of the multiverse.

Notable new characters include Yelena Boleva (Florence Pugh) from _Black Widow_, Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) from _Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings_, every Eternal including Harry Styles's Eros, Moon Knight (Oscar Isaac) from, erm, _Moon Knight_ and America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez) from _Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness_.

The latter seems like one of the most crucial new additions as it was revealed that she can travel the multiverse. However, _Loki_ also introduced He Who Remains who is a variant of Kang the Conqueror – a character who was originally being set up to be the main villain of The Multiverse Saga.

In terms of the multiverse, Peter Parker briefly broke it in _Spider-Man: No Way Home_ to make the world forget he was Spider-Man, while Doctor Strange ventured into the multiverse to save America from a vengeful Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) who [may, or may not, be dead](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a40373210/doctor-strange-2-wanda-ending-theories-dead-alive/) now.

As for other important things to remember, it's hard to say right now as pretty much every Phase 4 outing – whether on the big screen or the small screen – was largely self-contained with minimal crossovers. The credit scenes largely served to introduce new characters, such as the aforementioned Eros in _Eternals_.

Once we see more of where the MCU is going in Phase 5, we might discover there were important details in Phase 4 beyond introducing new characters, and we'll update this if that turns out to be the case.

What's it all about?
--------------------

Given its place out of time, the second season of _Loki_ might have jumped all over the [timeline](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a45640277/marvel-timeline-mcu/). But crucially, in the final episode, we saw Loki create the multiverse and become the God of Stories in charge of them.

His actions let loose multiple variants of Kang across the multiple timelines, putting us on a path to _Avengers: Secret Wars_. We saw [one of them in _Quantumania_](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a42907588/kang-explained-ant-man-quantumania-mcu-marvel-villain/), but Ant-Man made short work of him.

We had assumed that we'd see Kang and more of his variants across Phase 5, although [Jonathan Majors has now been dropped by Marvel](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a46167958/marvel-drops-jonathan-majors-convicted-assault-harassment/) and it's unclear whether Kang will be seen again.

It appears the new Big Bad of the Multiverse Saga is going to be [Doctor Doom](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a61735535/robert-downey-jr-doctor-doom-mcu/), played in a [surprise return by Robert Downey Jr](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a61717229/avengers-5-robert-downey-jr-doctor-doom/), but there's been no confirmation about Kang's future (or lack of).

_Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3_ didn't really care much for the wider MCU and just focused on wrapping up the story of the Guardians, although it did introduce a new version of the team that could return in the future.

_Secret Invasion_ turned out to be a bit of a dud and mostly served to get Nick Fury back in the game for _The Marvels_, which did do something major for the MCU as it introduced the [X-Men](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a45764292/the-marvels-x-men-rumour/) in the [credit scene](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a45766341/the-marvels-credit-scenes-how-many/).

Well, one of them in the form of Kelsey Grammer's Beast, but we'll be seeing a lot more of them going forward.

_Deadpool & Wolverine_ featured a lot of mutants, but none of them in the main Earth-616 timeline. Truthfully, the movie is more self-contained than you might expect, acting more of a farewell to the Fox Marvel universe than setting up anything major for the MCU going forward.

_Agatha All Along_ followed the trend by being largely self-contained, but it did bring [Wiccan back into the MCU](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a62567266/agatha-all-along-joe-locke-character-reveal-wiccan/) which could set up a future _Young Avengers_ movie. Likewise, _Daredevil: Born Again_ is a contained ground-level series, but could lead to Charlie Cox popping up in the _Avengers_ double-bill.

_Captain America: Brave New World_ did at least start to shift the pieces into place for the big finale of The Multiverse Saga.

Sam Wilson is asked to restart the Avengers by newly-elected US President Thaddeus Ross, who ends up in The Raft by the end of the movie so who knows if that will still happen, while we learned Tiamut (remember _Eternals_?) is the home of the MCU's adamantium.

Wilson is also warned about having to [protect Earth against "the others"](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a63782769/captain-america-brave-new-world-credit-scenes-explained/), hinting at the _Secret Wars_ storyline to come.

_Thunderbolts*_ is largely standalone, but by the end of the movie, the team has been rebraneded by Valentina Allegra de Fontaine as The New Avengers.

The credit scene, which takes place 14 months after the movie, suggests that hasn't gone down well with the wider public, and Wilson is actually filing for copyright of the Avengers name.

What's more, we see The Fantastic Four's space craft enter orbit as the credit scene ends (more on that in a bit).

The final outing of Phase 5 was _Ironheart_ and while it was largely separate, it did finally [introduce Mephisto into the MCU](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a65246649/ironheart-zelma-regan-aliyah-post-credit-scene/) after years of fan speculation. How much of a part Mephisto will play going forward remains to be seen though.

Phase 6 (2025 to 2027)

What's it all about?
--------------------

_The Fantastic Four: First Steps_ has officially kicked off Phase 6, bringing Marvel's first family into the MCU and in their own universe (Earth-828), separate from the 'main' MCU universe (Earth-616).

We know they'll eventually cross over in _Avengers: Doomsday_, but the movie is otherwise completely separate. We didn't see the events that lead to their ship appearing in Earth-616 as it happened in the _Thunderbolts*_ credit scene, but we did get our first (brief) look at Doctor Doom – even if we didn't see his face.

Currently, there's only set to be three other movies in Phase 6 – _Spider-Man: Brand New Day_ and the _Avengers_ double-bill – but maybe there will be a surprise announcement in the coming months.

Will we still get _[Blade](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a40817985/blade-release-date-mcu/)_? Who [knows](https://www.digitalspy.com/movies/a62692069/marvel-blade-release-date-delayed/). We do know though that confirmed TV shows arriving in Phase 6 include [_Vision Quest_](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a61959356/marvel-vision-ultron-james-spader/) and [Wonder Man](https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/ustv/a62775002/yahya-abdul-mateen-ii-wonder-man/).

What will happen in any of these Phase 6 outings remains to be seen, though.
