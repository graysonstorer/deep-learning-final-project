COLLECTED BY

 Organization: [Archive Team](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam)

![Image 4: The image shows an archive team going to rescue your shit, and contains two plastic crates filled with old CD-ROMs, as well as a cabinet of old-fashioned cassette tapes](http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg) Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history. 
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at [archiveteam.org](http://www.archiveteam.org/) and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php), providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

**The Archive Team Panic Downloads** are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

‘Daredevil: Born Again’ Just Properly Crossed Over With the MCU — Here’s How

“[Daredevil: Born Again](https://web.archive.org/web/20250326020514/https://www.thewrap.com/tag/daredevil/)” marks the official entrance into the Marvel Cinematic Universe for most of the characters in the show — save for Charlie Cox’s Matt Murdock, who first appeared via “Spider-Man: No Way Home” and then again in “She-Hulk,” and Vincent D’Onofrio’s Wilson Fisk, who appeared in “Hawkeye” and “Echo.”

The original Netflix series was technically set within the larger MCU, but rarely even indulged in references and kept mainly to [its own corner of street-level heroes](https://web.archive.org/web/20250326020514/https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-marvel-shows-in-order-defenders/). Up until this point, “Born Again” has followed suit and hasn’t featured any major crossovers with the MCU at large, aside from a couple of references here and there.

Well, that changed with Episode 5, but if you haven’t kept up with the other Marvel shows on Disney+, you might be a little confused about how.

To be fair, “Born Again” technically connected itself to the larger universe with a brief glimpse of the Broadway marquee for “[Rogers: The Musical](https://web.archive.org/web/20250326020514/https://www.thewrap.com/marvel-fans-think-fake-captain-america-musical-in-hawkeye-trailer-may-literally-be-the-funniest-s-ive-ever-seen/),” which we first saw back in ‘Hawkeye.” But beyond that, there have been no major character appearances outside of those from the original Netflix “Daredevil” series.

And really, we wouldn’t call episode 5’s surprise character _major._ In fact, he’s kind of an unexpected choice to weave things together. But in a weird way, it worked. The character in question? Yusuf Khan, played by Mohan Kapur.

[Do You Need to Watch the Original 'Daredevil' Series Before 'Born Again'?](https://web.archive.org/web/20250326020514/https://www.thewrap.com/do-you-need-to-watch-original-daredevil-series-before-born-again/)

In the most recent episode of “Daredevil: Born Again,” now streaming on Disney+, Matt Murdock (Cox) heads to the bank to try and secure a loan for his law firm. He’s supposed to speak to the manager, but unfortunately, the manager isn’t in that day, which puts Matt at the desk of the assistant manager, Yusuf.

As he and Matt chat, Yusuf proudly boasts about his daughter Kamala Khan — better known now as the superhero Ms. Marvel. But, Daredevil has never heard of Ms. Marvel.

Now, if you watched the “Ms. Marvel” series on Disney+, or “The Marvels,” you definitely know who Kamala Khan is. But if you haven’t, here’s the short version: she’s a mutant, who can manipulate energy. Yes, a mutant. No, she’s not part of the X-Men.

She’s mostly known in Jersey City, but we also learned at the end of “The Marvels” that she’s [hoping to put together her own team](https://web.archive.org/web/20250326020514/https://www.thewrap.com/the-marvels-young-avengers-iman-vellani-interview/). And, if Yusuf’s offhanded comment to Matt about Kamala being in Los Angeles at the moment is anything to go off of, she might be doing just that.

Perhaps we’ll learn a little more if Matt ever makes it to Jersey City for dinner at the Khan household, as he was invited to do. But for now, “Daredevil: Born Again” has simply had its first official crossover with the larger world it exists in.

_“Daredevil: Born Again” is now streaming on Disney+._
