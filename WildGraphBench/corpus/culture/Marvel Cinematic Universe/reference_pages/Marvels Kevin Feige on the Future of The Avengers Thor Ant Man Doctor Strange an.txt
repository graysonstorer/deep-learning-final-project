Marvel's Kevin Feige on the Future of _The Avengers_, _Thor_, _Ant Man_, _Doctor Strange_, and _Captain America_!
=================================================================================================================

The Avengers, Thor, Ant Man, Doctor Strange, Captain America

 Marvel Studios president of production Kevin Feige went on record this week at an [Iron Man 2](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/iron-man-2) set visit being held in Downey, California, about the future of all upcoming Marvel movie adaptations. He talked extensively about [The Avengers](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/marvels-the-avengers), [Thor](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/thor), [Ant-Man](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/ant-man), [Doctor Strange](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/doctor-strange), and [The First Avenger: Captain America](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/captain-america-the-first-avenger). The biggest news is that [The Incredible Hulk](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/the-incredible-hulk) will be making his next appearance in [The Avengers](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/marvels-the-avengers) movie, which has a tentative release date of May 4th, 2012.

 Feige stated, "It will have been four years since he was in a movie by that point. By 2012. I'd like to see him in it. I'm not being coy. We're just starting the story. I was on the phone with Zak Penn this morning. He's coming in next week and he's going to work on the outline this summer. It's so intertwined with what we're doing before it. I almost wanted to get done with production on [Iron Man 2](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/iron-man-2), and the scripts to [Thor](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/thor) and [The First Avenger: Captain America](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/captain-america-the-first-avenger) well underway, before we even started [The Avengers](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/marvels-the-avengers)."

 Neither this, nor the two previous [Hulk](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/hulk) films rule out the possibility of a third stand-alone film for the mighty green giant. Feige continued, telling his enraptured audience, "Now at least we can talk about Hulk being onscreen and Hulk being in a movie. I think we can go to something that isn't a surreal experience and is more a Marvel movie experience. It can tie into and be a part of this Marvel Cinema Universe that I've talked about."

 Feige also gave his thoughts on [Ant-Man](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/ant-man), saying, "I want to make [Ant-Man](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/ant-man) one of these days. I think that'll be surprising and funny. I love Edgar Wright. What he likes about it is that when he says he's doing [Ant-Man](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/ant-man), people go, '[Ant-Man](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/ant-man)? What the hell is that?' I think that's funny." [Doctor Strange](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/doctor-strange) was also a point of discussion, "I think [Doctor Strange](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/doctor-strange) would kick ass. I think we've done very well at this street level superhero aspect of the Marvel Universe. I think with [Thor](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/thor), you'll see us cracking into the cosmic side of the Marvel Universe in a very good way that's never been done before in our movies. I'd love to get into that supernatural element. I think that [Doctor Strange](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/doctor-strange) could be a good lynchpin into that universe with 'Werewolf By Night'. Maybe with [Blade](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/blade) again someday. I would like to see that side of the Marvel Universe on screen."

 Kevin also discussed the casting status as far as [The First Avenger: Captain America](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/captain-america-the-first-avenger) goes, "There are only a handful of stars that mean anything here, much less overseas. I do think that will be a factor in it. As long as we have the freedom to cast the best actor for the part. Whether it's an actor who's been a great actor, but hasn't starred in marquee action movies before like Robert Downey, or somebody that came out of Australia that we've never heard of." Kevin then went on to mention Will Smith, relating how much he loves the "Truth" storyline, which introduced a black Captain America that pre-dates Steve Rogers, "I love the 'Truth' storyline. I think that's very cool. I wouldn't do that as a first Captain America movie though. I think that arc came about four or five hundred issues into the "Cap" run. I don't see us launching with that particular comic."

 Finally, Kevin ended with a tease of the [The Avengers](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/marvels-the-avengers) movie, hinting, "I think [The Avengers](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/marvels-the-avengers) is going to have it's own vibe. It'll have a different tone than the other Marvel movies. It is about saving the world, because there's no other reason for characters that powerful to band together. I think the scope and the scale will feel like a much bigger thing. Like [Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen). Whatever you had seen, whether Starscream was your favorite character or Megatron is your favorite character or Soundwave is your favorite character, you're going to see the experience of that epic thing coming together. I think it'll be the same thing with [The Avengers](https://www.movieweb.com/movie/marvels-the-avengers)."

I don't think Ant-Man needs his own movie. If they are going to do that, why wouldn't Wasp? If for any other reason, these two characters should be the usual additions to a sequel (as Avengers will be for the most part Iron Man 2.5, The Incredible Hulk 1.5, etc). As for Doctor Strange, that would be a movie i'd like to see happen. I'd cast some such as Liam Neeson as Strange. He has both the presence and needed mystique to portay the sorcerer supreme.

Rob Zombie should totally play Doctor Strange.

another Blade movie would be cool as long as they don't do it like the third one because that really sucked ass. this new blade prequel is also going to suck ass, because I want to see blade cut up some more vampires.

THE HELL WITH TRYING TO MAKE A MOVIE WITH CRAP PLOTS AND SUCH. THE THING TO DO IS GO INTO THE COMIC BOOK OR CARTOON REALM. AFTER WATCHING SPIDERMAN, TRANSFORMERS, STAR TREK, HULK, IRON MAN AND SUCH, THIS IS WHAT HOLLYWOOD SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON. THIS IS THE ONLY THING THAT I WAS CONCERNED AS A KID WAS THE SPECIAL EFFECTS. TRANSFORMERS, BATMAN, STAR TREK, HULK, I WASN'T FOND OF THEM. I COULD HAVE LIVED WITH OR WITHOUT THEM, BUT THE SPECIAL EFFECTS IS THE KEY!!! YOU CAN ARGUE WHO SHOULD PLAY WHO, BUT THEIR BURNING DAYLIGHT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THAT PART PLUS THE MERE FACT THEY ARE WASTING MY TIME PUTTING SOMETHING OUT THAT I'M NOT GONNA SPEND MY MONEY ON ANYWAY. THE ONLY THINGS THAT ARE BUSTING BOX OFFICES ARE MARVEL, PIRATES, LORD OF RINGS, HARRY POTTER. THESE OTHER ACTORS BETTER GET WITH THE PROGRAM CAUSE THIS STUFF IS PROVEN, WE WERE WAITING ON SPECIAL EFFECTS TO CATCH UP WITH IT. JUST LIKE PEOPLE SAID ALREADY, STUFF SEEM LIKE IT'S BEING RUSHED. IT IS BECAUSE THEY ARE DOING ONE MOVIE A YEAR OR TWO. TOO MANY STORYLINES, SOME SCRIPTS ARE ALREADY WRITTEN IN THE COMIC BOOKS, WE JUST NEED YOU TO PUT IT ON THE SCREEN. OTHER MOVIES ARE CONSIDERED CRAP AND THEY WILL MAKE MONEY AT DVD LEVEL. 

 LET'S START SPITTING THESE OUT A LITTLE FASTER.

Ant-man I never did care for but the rest of them I do like.

 Personally I think Blade needs to come back,another actor needs to have that role.

 Captain America - please no famous people.

 Doctor Strange - I can see Johnny Depp as him but that's just mu opinion.

does anyone else think this is too HURRIED? I think focusing on the SOLO characters to setup avengers is smart. Leaving plot holes enough to string them together for avengers is also smart.

 But rushing into this might ruin the tone/quality of the story?

 I'm not sure if it's confirmed, but he'd be stupid not to accept when he's at the top of their list.

Look i love what im hearing but im woth alot of you i think Cap should be an amrican actor BUT the role should go to who can play it best, as far as will goes we would all be lucky if he got the role at least we would know someone wiht real acting skills is behind the mask, i think CAp should be Mathew Fox or Ryan gosling or Scott Speedman, Antman will be made and it will be huge, they already have Joe Johnston directinf Captain America....if i was Marvel i'd Jon Favreau to do The Avengers hes already knee deep in marvel and he's done an amazing job with Iron Man.

With Louis Letterier directing Clash of the Titans, which happens to star Worthington, and Letterier having connections with the Avengers team having also directed the Incredible Hulk, it's not a stretch that Worthington would be considered for the role. "somebody that came out of Australia that we've never heard of." Worthington's Australian...and I had never heard of him before TS

 As for Will Smith, it wouldn't be an atrocity if he was chosen...he WON'T be, but I'm just saying it wouldn't be terrible. Smith's a great actor. If they went the black route, he's the only black actor today that I would want playing the role...he IS known as Mr. 4th of July

 Ant-Man as some potential to be a surprise hit as a comedic super hero flick, but it's not towards the top of my most anticipated. Neither is Dr. Strange, but they need a capable director to make that work, and Del Toro was their best bet. Scott Lang will most likely be Ant-Man in the solo film with Pym in the Avengers...Pym's life isn't very comedic.

 I want the Sentry. Just a no-holds barred super hero story. For those of you who want the next Superman movie to be dark, just hope for a Sentry film. We've seen the "dark" comic book adaptations with street-level heroes like Batman, Daredevil, and Blade but not the omnipotent beings. As long as Fox doesn't handle it, it could make for one hell of a movie, one that tells his origin and his spiral to madness after being mindwiped. He's a lesser known character, but it has potential.

Honestly I think they announced an Avengers movie too soon. You could kind of tell it's being rushed, with Nick Fury popping up in Iron Man and Robert Downey Jr. in The Incredible Hulk. It's alot of characters they have to focus on and there is a big chance "The Avengers" may not be released in 2012. 

 I wonder if Edward Norton will play Bruce Banner for an Avengers flick. A Doctor Strange movie seems a bit too much right now...

Interesting. I'd like to see Sam Worthington as Captain America. Josh, I get what you're saying, but they cast non-Americans in American film role all the time. Example Russell Crowe who is Australia but born in New Zealand as Richie Roberts in American Gangster. What about all the movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger, where he plays the obvious non-American "hero" (but I may be wrong). I'm just saying, anything is possible...
