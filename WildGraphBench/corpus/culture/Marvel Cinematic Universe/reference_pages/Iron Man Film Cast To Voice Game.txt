Iron Man Film Cast to Voice Game
================================

Share.

 Three actors sign on for a shot at videogame fame. 

By Ryan Geddes Three cast members of the upcoming [Iron Man](https://www.ign.com/games/iron-man "Iron Man") feature film will also lend their acting talents to the game tie-in, Marvel and SEGA announced today.

Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark), Terence Howard (Jim Rhodes) and Shaun Toub (Yinsen) will all reprise their on-screen roles for the Iron Man game, due out on May 2, 2008, to coincide with the film's release.

Although Downey, Howard and Toub have signed on to act in the Iron Man game, some of the film's highest-profile stars have opted out. Samuel L. Jackson, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges were not mentioned in a news release as being part of the game.

Developed by Secret Level, published by SEGA and based on the Marvel comics and film, Iron Man is a third-person action shooter for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Wii, Nintendo DS and PC.
