On 31 Octob er 2016, 22:13:54 UTC, PrimeGrid’s Seventeen or Bust sub project found the Mega 

Prime: 

10223 *2 31172165 +1 

The prime is 9 ,383,761 digits long and will enter Chris Caldwell's “The Largest Known Primes 

Database” ( http://primes.utm.edu/primes ) ranked 7th overall. 

Th is is the largest prime found attempting to solve the Sierpinski Problem and eliminates 

k=10223 as a possible Sierpinski number . It is also the largest known Proth prime, the largest 

known Co lbert number (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ColbertNumber.html ) , and the largest 

prime PrimeGrid has discovered. Among the 10 largest known prime numbers, it is the only 

prime that is not a M ersenne number, and the only known non -Mersenne prime over 4 million 

digits. 

Until the Seventeen or Bust project shut down earlier in the year, this search was a 

collaboration between PrimeGrid and Seventeen or Bust. This discovery would not have been 

possible without all the work done over the years by Seventeen or Bust. 

The discovery was made by Szabolcs Peter of Hungary using an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 -4770 

CPU @ 3.40GHz with 12 GB RAM, running Windows 10 Enterprise Edition . This computer took 

about 8 da ys, 22 hour s, 34 minute s to complete the primality test using LLR. 

Information regarding double checking will be announced at a later date. 

Credits for the discovery are as follows: 

1. Szabolcs Peter (Hungary ), discoverer 

2. PrimeGrid, et al.

OpenPFGW, a primality program developed by Chris Nash & Jim Fougeron, was used to check 

for Fermat Number divisibility (including generalized and extended). For more informatio n about 

Fermat and generalized Fermat Number divisors, please see Wilfrid Keller's sites: 

• http://www.prothsearch.net/fermat.html 

• http://www.prot hsearch.net/GFNfacs.html 

Testing for Fermat, GFN, and xGFN divisors is still underway, and if any are found they will be 

announced once that testing is complete. 

The Seventeen or Bust Project was administered by Louis Helm, David Norris and Michael 

Garr ison. PrimeGrid’s

Using a single PC would have taken centuries to find this prime. So this timely discovery would 

not have been possible without the thousands of volunteers who contributed their spare CPU 

cycles. A special thanks to everyone who contributed their ad vice and/or computing power to 

the search - especially all the sievers who work behind the scenes to make a find like this 

possible. 

PrimeGrid’s Seventeen or Bust subproject will continue to seek to elimin ate the remaining 5 k 

value s in the Sierpinski pro blem . To join the search please visit PrimeGrid:

About PrimeGrid 

PrimeGrid is a distributed computing project, developed by Rytis Slatkevi čius and currently 

administered by Iain Bethune, James Breslin, Scott Brown, Ulri ch Fries, Charley Gielkens, 

Michael Goetz, Roger Karpin, Rytis Slatkevi čius, and Van Zimmerman. 

PrimeGrid is hosted by Rackspace, and their generous contributions have helped make this 

project possible. 

PrimeGrid utilizes BOINC and PRPNet to search for primes with the primary goal of bringing the 

excitement of prime finding to the "everyday" computer user. Simply download the software and 

let your computer do the rest. Participants can choose from a variety of prime forms to search. 

With a little patienc e, you may find a large or even record breaking prime. 

BOINC 

The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a software platform 

for distributed computing using volunteered computer resources. It allows users to 

participate in multiple distributed computing projects through a single program. Currently 

BOINC is being developed by a team based at the University of California, Berkeley led 

by David Anderson. 

This platform currently supports projects from biology to math to astronomy. For m ore 

information, please visit BOINC: http://boinc.berkeley.edu 

PRPNet 

PRPNet is a client/server application written by Mark Rodenkirch that is specifically 

designed to help find prime numbers of various forms. It is easily ported between various 

OS/hardware combinations. PRPNet does not run each PRP test itself, but relies on 

helper programs, such as LLR, PFGW, phrot, wwww, and genefer to do the work.
