To show that(x+y)’=x’+y’:If x or y is 0,this is immediate.If y=—x/k,it is a consequence of(1),(2),and R(o,—x/k,0,x—(x/k))=k.If none of these relations between x and y hold,it follows from R(y,—x/k,(x+y)/(1—2),

By(1),induction,repeated use of the lemma and the fact that 7 is an automorphism of the additive group of F,it follows that 7 preserves any cross ratio in K,where K is the subfield of F generated by k.It is worth remarking that since—1©€K the theorem now follows,in case the characteristic of F is not 2,from the fact mentioned in the introduction.But a proof for the general case is not much longer.

To prove that 7 is an automorphism of the multiplicative group of F,we first show that(1/x)’=1/x’.This is obtained from R(x—k+1,0,1,k+(k—k*)/x)=k.(x?)’=(x’)?follows from R(x?—2kx+h’,1,x—k,1+kx—2h?+(k'—k)/x)=k.In each of these cases,two elements inside the cross ratio symbol can coincide only if x€K,where the assertions to be proven are already known to hold.

Next,((xy)’)?=(x’y’)?follows from B((1/x?)+y—ky,0,y,ky+k(1—)-(xy)?)=k,provided all entries are distinct.But each of the cases in which the entries are not distinct can easily be handled separately.Hence,(xy)’=+x’y’.If F is of characteristic 2,we are finished.Otherwise,if for some xy#0,we have(xy)’=—x’y’,then+(x’y’+x’)=(x(y+1))’=(xy+x)’=—x'y’+<x’,which is impossible.

CorROLLARY.Jf r is any 1-1 mapping onto itself such that for some kEF,k¥0,1,t preserves cross ratio k,then t is the composition of a projective trans formation of m and an automorphism of F.

THE ROW-SUMS OF THE INVERSE MATRIX ALBERT WILANSKY,Lehigh University

This note closes with an unsolved problem,and begins with the following surprising,yet almost trivial,fact about a matrix with an inverse.

If the sum of the elements in each row of a square matrix is k,then the sum of the elements in each row of the inverse matrix is 1/k.

The proof is as follows.Let A be m Xm,non-singular,with the stated prop erty.Let B be its inverse.Then for nSm,

1==DnsQer=Onsder=Bas.r=1 r=1 s=1 s=1 r=1 s=1 This completes the proof.(A is singular if k=0.)The result has an obvious application to magic squares.Since the crucial point is an interchange of summations we can conclude:

i t|m m™m m‘

1951]MATHEMATICAL NOTES 615

The same is true for an infinite matrix A such that the inverse matrix has finite rows(i.e.almost all the elements in each row are zero).Furthermore,the inverse matrix need be only a left inverse.

A triangular matrix,i.e.one such that the mth row has no non-zero entries beyond the mth place,can be shown to have a two-sided inverse if and only if it is normal,7.e.has no zeros on its main diagonal.Such a matrix is easily shown to have a normal inverse.Thus we conclude:

The result holds for normal matrices.

We observe that the row-sums of the inverse need not exist.For example,let A have the rows(1,1,0,0,0,---),(0,1,1,0,0,0,---),(0,0,1,1,0,0,0,---),then the two-sided inverse has the rows(1,—1,1,—1,---),(0,1,—1,1,—1,---+)+-++.We notice,however,the suggestive fact that the rows of the inverse matrix are summable by many of the classical methods to the expected value 3.That this is not generally true is shown by replacing,in the nth row of A as defined above,the pair(1,1)by(a,5)or by(8,a)re spectively according as m is odd or even,where a,b are any numbers satisfying ab 0.

A further observation is that it is not sufficient to assume only that the in verse is a right inverse.For let A be formed by adjoining a column of zeros on the left side of the identity matrix.It has,as right inverse,the matrix obtained by adjoining a row of zeros to the top of the identity matrix.The row-sums of A are one,not so for the right inverse.

I conjecture that“no”is the answer to the Problem:Will the result hold for a matrix A and its inverse(or left inverse)if it is merely assumed that each row of the inverse matrix has a sum?

REPRESENTATION OF THE INTEGERS BY POSITIVE INTEGERS

Roy Dusiscu,Fresno State College

The integers are commonly constructed from the positive integers by the use of pairs of positive integers.That is,one considers the integers as pairs*(a,6)for which

(a,6)=(c,d)if a+d=b+6,

(1)(a,b)+(c,d)=(a+¢,6+d),(a,b)X(c,d)=(ac+bd,ad+bc),

for positive integers a,b,c,and d.From(1)and the properties of positive integers it is then possible to establish the commutative,associative,distribu tive laws,etc.for integers.

We propose here to consider the integers as single positive integers.To do this we consider the set of positive integers as divided up into two classes,the even numbers(the negative integers)and the odd numbers(the non-negative integers).Addition(@)is then defined by

*More exactly,as classes of equivalent pairs.

m@Bn=nOm=m—n if m is odd,even,and m>n.

Here,of course,the addition on the right is the ordinary addition of positive integers while m—n is defined by m—n=c(m,n,c positive integers)if m=n-+c.Likewise m>n means there exists a positive integer k such that m=n-+k.

Similarly,multiplication(@)is defined by

m@n=(mn-+2)/2 if mand are both even,m@n=(mn—m—n+3)/2 if mand are both odd,mO@n=n@®m=(nm—m)/2 if mis even,n odd,and>1,

(3)

1@n=n@®1=1 forall positive integers n.

Here the multiplication on the right is the ordinary multiplication of positive integers.

We now claim that the set of positive integers under©and@is isomorphic to the set of pairs of positive integers(7.e.,the integers)under the correspond ence

(4)(a,b)<>(2a+1)®20.

By virtue of(2),and(2)3 respectively,(4)can be re-written as(a,b)<>(2a+1)—2b=2A(a—b)+1*if(a,b)26—if a<b.

For example,(4,1)2(4—1)+1=7 and(2,6)<+2(6—2)=8.Then(4,1)+(2,6)=(4+2,1+6)=(6,7)by(1).But 768=8—7+1=2 by(2);and(6,7)<+2(7—6)=2.Similarly,(4,1)X(2,6)=(4-2+1-6,4-6+1-2)=(14,26)by(1)3.But 7@8=(7-8—8)/2=24 by(3)s and(14,26)<+2(26—14)=24.

The proof of this isomorphism is straightforward but somewhat tedious due

to the complexity of the definitions of©and®and will be left to the interested reader.

where K is a fixed positive number and p,is the mth prime.This result(due to Ingham[2])is fairly deep.Here I prove THEOREM There is a number a such that,if 80=a,Sati=26,(n=0),then[eo]=[2"(m=1),is always a prime.

I require only the very elementary result that,for every N22,there is a prime between N and 2N(see[2]).By this,we can choose a sequence of primes{P,}such that Pi:=2 or 3 and

ON THE DENSITY OF SETS OF GAUSSIAN INTEGERS LuTHER CHEO,University of Oregon

1.Introduction.We present two theorems and a remark on the density of sets of Gaussian integers in the first quadrant of the complex plane.A Gaussian integer is a complex number of the form a+a’i where a and a’are integers.Attention is confined exclusively to the set Q of those Gaussian integers a+a’i with a20 and a’20 but not both a=0 and a’=0.

If S is a set of positive integers,Schnirelman[1]lets S(x)denote the number of elements s of S with s2x and defines the density of S to be the greatest lower bound of the fraction S(x)/x for x=1,2,---.By analogy,we adopt the following.

Definition:Let A bea set of Gaussian integers(subset of Q).For each Gaussian integer x+yi,let A(x+~z)denote the number of Gaussian integers a+a’i in A with aSx and a’Sy.The density of A is defined to be

A(x+yi)

g.1.b,

taken over all x+y in Q.

2.Two theorems.If A and B are subsets of Q,the sum A+B is defined to be the set C consisting of all elements a+a’,and all a+d+(a’+b’)i with a+a’i in A and b+06'z in B.Let the densities of A,B,and C be a,B and¥respectively.

THEOREM 1.Jf 21,then y=1.

Proof.Suppose y<1,then there is an element u+v7 not in C.Whenever a+a’t is in A,u—a+(v—a’)i is not in B.Therefore A(u+vi)+B(u+v7)Suv+u+v—1.Thus

A(u+vi)+Blu+vi)“

That is,a+8<1.This contradicts the hypothesis.
