The Lucas-Lehmer test for Mersenne primes
=========================================

2 October, 2008 in [expository](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/category/expository/), [math.NT](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/category/mathematics/mathnt/) | Tags: [Galois theory](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/tag/galois-theory/), [Lagrange's theorem](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/tag/lagranges-theorem/), [Lucas-Lehmer test](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/tag/lucas-lehmer-test/), [Mersenne primes](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/tag/mersenne-primes/), [primality testing](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/tag/primality-testing/)

In the last few weeks, the [Great Internet Mersenne Prime Search](http://www.mersenne.org/) (GIMPS) announced the discovery of two new [Mersenne primes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime), both over ten million digits in length, including one discovered by the computing team right here at UCLA (see [this page](http://www.math.ucla.edu/~edson/prime/) for more information). [I was not involved in this computing effort.] As for the question “Why do we want to find such big primes anyway?”, see [this page](http://primes.utm.edu/notes/faq/why.html), though this is not the focus of my post today.

The GIMPS approach to finding Mersenne primes relies of course on modern computing power, parallelisation, and efficient programming, but the number-theoretic heart of it – aside from some basic optimisation tricks such as [fast multiplication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nhage-Strassen_algorithm) and preliminary sieving to eliminate some obviously non-prime Mersenne number candidates – is the [Lucas-Lehmer primality test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas%E2%80%93Lehmer_test_for_Mersenne_numbers) for Mersenne numbers, which is much faster for this special type of number than any known general-purpose (deterministic) primality test (such as, say, the [AKS test](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test)). This test is easy enough to describe, and I will do so later in this post, and also has some short elementary proofs of correctness; but the proofs are sometimes presented in a way that involves pulling a lot of rabbits out of hats, giving the argument a magical feel rather than a natural one. In this post, I will try to explain the basic ideas that make the primality test work, seeking a proof which is perhaps less elementary and a little longer than some of the proofs in the literature, but is perhaps a bit better motivated.

— Order —

We begin with a general discussion of how to tell when a given number n (which is not necessarily of the Mersenne form ![Image 185: n = 2^m-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3D+2%5Em-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0)) is prime or not. One should think of n as being moderately large, e.g. ![Image 186: n \sim 10^{10^7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%5Csim+10%5E%7B10%5E7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (which is broadly the size of the Mersenne primes discovered recently).

Our starting point will be [Lagrange’s theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange%27s_theorem_(group_theory)), which asserts that

![Image 187: a^{|G|} = 1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E%7B%7CG%7C%7D+%3D+1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (1)

for any finite group G and any ![Image 188: a \in G](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%5Cin+G&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), thus the [order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_a_group)![Image 189: \hbox{ord}_G(a)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chbox%7Bord%7D_G%28a%29&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) of a in G divides |G|. Specialising this to the multiplicative group ![Image 190: {\Bbb F}_p^\times](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_p%5E%5Ctimes&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) of a [finite field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field) of prime order p, we obtain [Fermat’s little theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s_little_theorem)

![Image 191: a^{p-1} = 1 \hbox{ mod } p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E%7Bp-1%7D+%3D+1+%5Chbox%7B+mod+%7D+p&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (2)

for ![Image 192: p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) prime and ![Image 193: a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) coprime to ![Image 194: p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0); applying it instead to the multiplicative group ![Image 195: ({\Bbb Z}/n{\Bbb Z})^\times](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D%2Fn%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D%29%5E%5Ctimes&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) of a cyclic group of order ![Image 196: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), we obtain [Euler’s theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_theorem)

![Image 197: a^{\phi(n)} = 1 \hbox{ mod } n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E%7B%5Cphi%28n%29%7D+%3D+1+%5Chbox%7B+mod+%7D+n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (3)

whenever ![Image 198: a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is coprime to n, where ![Image 199: \phi(n) := |({\Bbb Z}/n{\Bbb Z})^\times|](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%28n%29+%3A%3D+%7C%28%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D%2Fn%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D%29%5E%5Ctimes%7C&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is the [Euler totient function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_totient_function) of n.

Fermat’s little theorem (2) already gives a necessary condition for the primality of a candidate prime ![Image 200: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0): take any ![Image 201: a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) coprime to ![Image 202: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (typically one picks a small number such as ![Image 203: a=2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D2&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) or ![Image 204: a=3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%3D3&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0)), and compute ![Image 205: a^{n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E%7Bn-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) modulo ![Image 206: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). If it is not equal to 1, then ![Image 207: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) cannot be prime. This is a (barely) feasible test to execute for ![Image 208: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) as large as ![Image 209: 10^{10^7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B10%5E7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), because one can compute exponents such as ![Image 210: a^{n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E%7Bn-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) relatively quickly, by the trick of repeatedly squaring a modulo n to obtain ![Image 211: a, a^2, a^{2^2}, a^{2^3}, \ldots \hbox{ mod } n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+a%5E2%2C+a%5E%7B2%5E2%7D%2C+a%5E%7B2%5E3%7D%2C+%5Cldots+%5Chbox%7B+mod+%7D+n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), and then decomposing ![Image 212: n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) into binary to compute ![Image 213: a^{n-1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E%7Bn-1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). (If ![Image 214: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is a Mersenne number, then there are some pretty obvious shortcuts one can take for this last step, using division instead of multiplication.) Unfortunately, while this test is necessary for primality, it is not sufficient, due to the existence of [pseudoprimes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoprime). So Fermat’s little theorem alone does not provide the answer, at least if one wants a _deterministic_ certificate of primality rather than a _probabilistic_ one.

Nevertheless, the above facts do provide some important information about the order ![Image 215: \hbox{ord}_n(a) := \hbox{ord}_{({\Bbb Z}/n{\Bbb Z})^*}(a)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chbox%7Bord%7D_n%28a%29+%3A%3D+%5Chbox%7Bord%7D_%7B%28%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D%2Fn%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D%29%5E%2A%7D%28a%29&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) of a modulo ![Image 216: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). If ![Image 217: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is prime, Fermat’s little theorem (2) tells us that ![Image 218: \hbox{ord}_n(a)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chbox%7Bord%7D_n%28a%29&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is at most ![Image 219: n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (in fact, it divides ![Image 220: n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0)). On the other hand, if ![Image 221: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is not prime, then Euler’s theorem (3) tells us that ![Image 222: \hbox{ord}_n(a)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chbox%7Bord%7D_n%28a%29&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) cannot be as large as ![Image 223: n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), but is instead at most ![Image 224: \phi(n)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cphi%28n%29&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), which is now strictly less than ![Image 225: n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). Thus: if we can find a number ![Image 226: a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) coprime to ![Image 227: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) such that ![Image 228: \hbox{ord}_n(a)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chbox%7Bord%7D_n%28a%29&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is exactly ![Image 229: n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), we have certified that ![Image 230: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is prime.

Testing whether a given number ![Image 231: a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is coprime to ![Image 232: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is very easy and fast (thanks to the [Euclidean algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm)). Unfortunately, it is difficult in general to compute the order ![Image 233: \hbox{ord}_n(a)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chbox%7Bord%7D_n%28a%29&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) of a number ![Image 234: a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) if the base ![Image 235: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is large; a brute-force approach would require one to compute up to ![Image 236: n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) powers of ![Image 237: a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), which is prohibitively expensive if ![Image 238: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) has size comparable to ![Image 239: 10^{10^7}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=10%5E%7B10%5E7%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). (More generally, the problem of computing order exactly in general is closely related to the [discrete logarithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm) problem, which is notoriously difficult.) However, there are a few cases in which the order can be found very quickly. Suppose that we somehow find positive integers ![Image 240: a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), ![Image 241: k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=k&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) such that

![Image 242: a^{2^k} = - 1 \hbox{ mod } n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E%7B2%5Ek%7D+%3D+-+1+%5Chbox%7B+mod+%7D+n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (4)

(which in particular implies that ![Image 243: a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is coprime to ![Image 244: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0)). Squaring this, we obtain

![Image 245: a^{2^{k+1}} = 1 \hbox{ mod } n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E%7B2%5E%7Bk%2B1%7D%7D+%3D+1+%5Chbox%7B+mod+%7D+n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0)

and so we see that ![Image 246: \hbox{ord}_n(a)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chbox%7Bord%7D_n%28a%29&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) divides ![Image 247: 2^{k+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bk%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) but not ![Image 248: 2^k](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5Ek&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), and thus must be exactly equal to ![Image 249: 2^{k+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bk%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). Conversely, if ![Image 250: \hbox{ord}_n(a) = 2^{k+1}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Chbox%7Bord%7D_n%28a%29+%3D+2%5E%7Bk%2B1%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), then we must have (4). So in the special case when the order of ![Image 251: a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is a power of 2, we can compute the order using only one exponentiation, which is computationally feasible for the orders of magnitude we are considering.

Unfortunately, this is not quite what we need for the Mersenne prime problem, because if ![Image 252: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is a Mersenne number, then it is ![Image 253: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0)_plus_ 1 which is a power of 2, rather than ![Image 254: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0)_minus_ 1. (The above method would be ideal for finding [Fermat primes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat_prime) rather than Mersenne primes, but it is likely that in fact there are no more such primes to be found.)

So this is a frustrating near miss: if ![Image 255: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is a Mersenne number, we can easily check if a number has order ![Image 256: n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) modulo ![Image 257: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), but we needed a test for when a number has order ![Image 258: n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) instead. And indeed, even when ![Image 259: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is prime, Fermat’s little theorem (2) shows that it is impossible for a number to have order ![Image 260: n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) modulo ![Image 261: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), since the order needs to divide ![Image 262: n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). So we seem to be a bit stuck.

But while ![Image 263: n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) clearly does not divide ![Image 264: n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), it _does_ divide ![Image 265: n^2-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). Looking at Lagrange’s theorem (1), we then see that it could be possible to find elements of order ![Image 266: n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) in a multiplicative group of order ![Image 267: n^2-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) rather than ![Image 268: n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). Recall that if ![Image 269: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) was prime, then the multiplicative group ![Image 270: {\Bbb F}_n^\times](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_n%5E%5Ctimes&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) of the finite field ![Image 271: {\Bbb F}_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) had order ![Image 272: n-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). But ![Image 273: {\Bbb F}_{n^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_%7Bn%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is also a finite field, and its multiplicative group ![Image 274: {\Bbb F}_{n^2}^\times](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_%7Bn%5E2%7D%5E%5Ctimes&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) has order ![Image 275: n^2-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E2-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). Aha!

So the plan (assuming for sake of argument that ![Image 276: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is prime) is to somehow work in the finite field ![Image 277: {\Bbb F}_{n^2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_%7Bn%5E2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) instead of ![Image 278: {\Bbb F}_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), in order to find elements of order ![Image 279: n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). We can get our hands on this larger finite field more concretely by viewing it as a [quadratic extension](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_extension)![Image 280: {\Bbb F}_n[\sqrt{a}]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_n%5B%5Csqrt%7Ba%7D%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), where a is a [quadratic non-residue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_residue) of ![Image 281: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0).

Let’s now take n to be a Mersenne prime. What numbers are quadratic non-residues? A quick appeal to [quadratic reciprocity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_reciprocity) and some elementary number theory soon reveals that 2 is a quadratic residue of ![Image 282: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), but that 3 is not. Thus we can take ![Image 283: {\Bbb F}_{n^2} \equiv {\Bbb F}_n[\sqrt{3}]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_%7Bn%5E2%7D+%5Cequiv+%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_n%5B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). (One could work with other numbers than 3 here, but being the smallest quadratic non-residue available, it is the simplest one to use, and the one which is most likely to be able to take advantage of the [strong law of small numbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_law_of_small_numbers).) Henceforth all calculations will be in this field ![Image 284: {\Bbb F}_n[\sqrt{3}]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_n%5B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), which of course contains ![Image 285: {\Bbb F}_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) as a subfield.

Now we need to look for a field element ![Image 286: a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) of order ![Image 287: n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), which is a power of 2. Thus (by adapting (4) to ![Image 288: {\Bbb F}_n[\sqrt{3}]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_n%5B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0)) we need to find a solution to the equation

![Image 289: a^{(n+1)/2} = -1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E%7B%28n%2B1%29%2F2%7D+%3D+-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (5)

in this field.

Let’s compute some expressions of the form ![Image 290: a^{(n+1)/2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E%7B%28n%2B1%29%2F2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). From Fermat’s little theorem (2) we have

![Image 291: 3^{n-1} = 1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5E%7Bn-1%7D+%3D+1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0);

because 3 is not a quadratic residue, we see (from taking [discrete logarithms](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_logarithm)) that

![Image 292: 3^{(n-1)/2} = -1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5E%7B%28n-1%29%2F2%7D+%3D+-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (6)

and thus

![Image 293: 3^{(n+1)/2} = -3](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=3%5E%7B%28n%2B1%29%2F2%7D+%3D+-3&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0).

Similarly we have

![Image 294: 2^{(n+1)/2} = +2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B%28n%2B1%29%2F2%7D+%3D+%2B2&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (7).

These are pretty close to (5), but not quite right. To go further, it is convenient to work with ![Image 295: n^{th}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bth%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) powers rather than ![Image 296: ((n+1)/2)^{th}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%28n%2B1%29%2F2%29%5E%7Bth%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) powers – i.e. we work with the [Frobenius automorphism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frobenius_endomorphism)![Image 297: x \mapsto x^n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=x+%5Cmapsto+x%5En&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). Indeed, since ![Image 298: {\Bbb F}_n[\sqrt{3}]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_n%5B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) has characteristic n, we have the automorphism properties

![Image 299: (x+y)^n = x^n + y^n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28x%2By%29%5En+%3D+x%5En+%2B+y%5En&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0); ![Image 300: (xy)^n = x^n y^n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28xy%29%5En+%3D+x%5En+y%5En&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). (8)

From (6) we have ![Image 301: (\sqrt{3})^n = - \sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%29%5En+%3D+-+%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), while from (2) we have ![Image 302: a^n = a](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5En+%3D+a&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) for ![Image 303: a \in {\Bbb F}_n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%5Cin+%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). From (8) we thus see that

![Image 304: (a + b \sqrt{3})^n = a - b \sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a+%2B+b+%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%29%5En+%3D+a+-+b+%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0)

for ![Image 305: a, b \in {\Bbb F_n}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2C+b+%5Cin+%7B%5CBbb+F_n%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0); thus the Frobenius automorphism is nothing more than Galois conjugation. (Actually, this can be deduced quite readily from standard [Galois theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory).)

Now we go back from ![Image 306: n^{th}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%5E%7Bth%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) powers to ![Image 307: ((n+1)/2)^{th}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%28n%2B1%29%2F2%29%5E%7Bth%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) powers. Multiplying both sides of the preceding equation by ![Image 308: a + b \sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a+%2B+b+%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), we obtain

![Image 309: (a+b \sqrt{3})^{n+1} = a^2 - 3b^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%2Bb+%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%29%5E%7Bn%2B1%7D+%3D+a%5E2+-+3b%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0).

Squaring ![Image 310: a+b\sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%2Bb%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), we conclude

![Image 311: (a^2+3b^2 + 2ab\sqrt{3})^{(n+1)/2} = a^2-3b^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28a%5E2%2B3b%5E2+%2B+2ab%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%29%5E%7B%28n%2B1%29%2F2%7D+%3D+a%5E2-3b%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0).

Now we in a good position to solve the equation (5). We cannot make ![Image 312: a^2 - 3b^2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=a%5E2+-+3b%5E2&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) equal to -1 – since -1 is not a quadratic residue modulo 3 – but we can make it equal to, say, -2, by setting a=1 and b=-1 (say):

![Image 313: (4 + 2 \sqrt{3})^{(n+1)/2} = -2](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%284+%2B+2+%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%29%5E%7B%28n%2B1%29%2F2%7D+%3D+-2&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0).

Dividing this by (7) we obtain the desired solution

![Image 314: \omega^{(n+1)/2} = -1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega%5E%7B%28n%2B1%29%2F2%7D+%3D+-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (9)

to (5), where ![Image 315: \omega := 2 + \sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega+%3A%3D+2+%2B+%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). (Note that one could also use ![Image 316: \omega^{-1} = 2-\sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega%5E%7B-1%7D+%3D+2-%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) here; indeed, [Galois theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory) tells us that ![Image 317: +\sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%2B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) and ![Image 318: -\sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=-%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) are interchangeable in these computations.)

To summarise, we have shown that

If ![Image 319: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is a Mersenne prime, then (9) holds.

Based on our previous discussion, we expect to be able to reverse this implication. Indeed, we have the following converse:

> **Lemma 1.** Let ![Image 320: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) be a Mersenne number. If (9) holds (in the ring ![Image 321: ({\Bbb Z}/n{\Bbb Z})[\sqrt{3}]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%28%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D%2Fn%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D%29%5B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0)), then ![Image 322: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is prime.

**Proof.** Let ![Image 323: q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) be a prime divisor of ![Image 324: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). Then ![Image 325: \omega^{(n+1)/2}=-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega%5E%7B%28n%2B1%29%2F2%7D%3D-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) in the field ![Image 326: {\Bbb F}_q[\sqrt{3}]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_q%5B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (which we define as ![Image 327: {\Bbb F}_q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_q&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) if 3 is a quadratic residue there), thus ![Image 328: \omega](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) has order exactly n+1 (cf. (4)). By Lagrange’s theorem (1), this means that ![Image 329: n+1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n%2B1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) divides the multiplicative order of ![Image 330: {\Bbb F}_q[\sqrt{3}]^\times](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+F%7D_q%5B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%5D%5E%5Ctimes&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), which is ![Image 331: q^2-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q%5E2-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (if 3 is a non-residue modulo ![Image 332: q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0)) or ![Image 333: q-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (if 3 is a residue modulo ![Image 334: q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0)). In particular, ![Image 335: q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=q&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) has to exceed ![Image 336: \sqrt{n}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). Thus the only prime divisors of ![Image 337: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) exceed ![Image 338: \sqrt{n}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), and so by the [sieve of Eratosthenes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_eratosthenes), ![Image 339: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is prime. (This proof is due [to Bruce](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=1209464).) ![Image 340: \Box](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5CBox&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0)

We have thus shown

> **Corollary 1.** (Lucas-Lehmer test, preliminary version) Let ![Image 341: n = 2^m-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3D+2%5Em-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) with m odd. Then n is prime if and only if (9) holds in ![Image 342: {\Bbb Z}/n{\Bbb Z}[\sqrt{3}]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D%2Fn%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D%5B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0).

This is already a reasonable criterion, but it is a little non-elementary (and also a little unpleasant numerically) due to the presence of the quadratic extension by ![Image 343: \sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). One can get rid of this extension by the Galois theory trick of taking [traces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_trace). Indeed, observe that ![Image 344: \omega^{-1} = 2 - \sqrt{3}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega%5E%7B-1%7D+%3D+2+-+%5Csqrt%7B3%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is the [Galois conjugate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_conjugate) of ![Image 345: \omega](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). Basic [Galois theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_theory) tells us that ![Image 346: \omega^{(n+1)/4} + \omega^{-(n+1)/4}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega%5E%7B%28n%2B1%29%2F4%7D+%2B+%5Comega%5E%7B-%28n%2B1%29%2F4%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) lies in ![Image 347: {\Bbb Z}/n{\Bbb Z}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D%2Fn%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), and vanishes precisely when ![Image 348: \omega^{(n+1)/2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega%5E%7B%28n%2B1%29%2F2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is equal to -1. So it suffices to show that

![Image 349: \omega^{(n+1)/4} + \omega^{-(n+1)/4} = \omega^{2^{m-2}} + \omega^{-2^{m-2}} =: S_{m-2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega%5E%7B%28n%2B1%29%2F4%7D+%2B+%5Comega%5E%7B-%28n%2B1%29%2F4%7D+%3D+%5Comega%5E%7B2%5E%7Bm-2%7D%7D+%2B+%5Comega%5E%7B-2%5E%7Bm-2%7D%7D+%3D%3A+S_%7Bm-2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0)

vanishes in ![Image 350: {\Bbb Z}/n{\Bbb Z}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D%2Fn%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0).

The quantity ![Image 351: \omega^{(n+1)/4} = \omega^{2^{m-2}}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Comega%5E%7B%28n%2B1%29%2F4%7D+%3D+%5Comega%5E%7B2%5E%7Bm-2%7D%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) could be computed by repeated squaring in ![Image 352: {\Bbb Z}/n{\Bbb Z}[\sqrt{3}]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D%2Fn%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D%5B%5Csqrt%7B3%7D%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). The quantity ![Image 353: S_{m-2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_%7Bm-2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) can be computed by a similar device in ![Image 354: {\Bbb Z}/n{\Bbb Z}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D%2Fn%7B%5CBbb+Z%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). Indeed, the sequence ![Image 355: S_j := \omega^{2^j} + \omega^{-2^j}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j+%3A%3D+%5Comega%5E%7B2%5Ej%7D+%2B+%5Comega%5E%7B-2%5Ej%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is easily seen to obey the recursion

![Image 356: S_j = S_{j-1}^2 - 2; \quad S_0 = 4](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_j+%3D+S_%7Bj-1%7D%5E2+-+2%3B+%5Cquad+S_0+%3D+4&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (10)

and so we have

> **Theorem 1.**(Lucas-Lehmer test, final version) Let ![Image 357: n = 2^m-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3D+2%5Em-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) with m odd. Then n is prime if and only if ![Image 358: S_{m-2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_%7Bm-2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) vanishes modulo n, where ![Image 359: S_{m-2}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=S_%7Bm-2%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is given by the recursion (10).

To apply this test, one needs to perform about ![Image 360: m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) squaring operations modulo ![Image 361: n](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0). Doing everything as efficiently as possible (in particular, using [fast multiplication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sch%C3%B6nhage-Strassen_algorithm)), the total cost of testing a single Mersenne number ![Image 362: n = 2^m-1](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n+%3D+2%5Em-1&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) for primality is about ![Image 363: O(m^2)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28m%5E2%29&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (modulo some ![Image 364: \log m](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Clog+m&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) terms). This turns out to barely be within reach of modern computers for ![Image 365: m \sim 10^7](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%5Csim+10%5E7&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0), especially since the algorithm is somewhat [parallelisable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing). (In contrast, the best known general-purpose deterministic primality testing algorithm, the [AKS algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test), has a run time of about ![Image 366: O(m^6)](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=O%28m%5E6%29&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) (with a sizable implicit constant), which is not feasible for ![Image 367: m \sim 10^7](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=m+%5Csim+10%5E7&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0).) There are general-purpose probabilistic tests (such as [Miller-Rabin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller-Rabin_primality_test)) which have run-time comparable to the Lucas-Lehmer test, but as mentioned at the beginning, we are only interested here in deterministic (and unconditional, e.g. not relying on [GRH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Riemann_hypothesis)) certificates of primality.

Thank you for this nice exposition! I should add that B. H. Gross recently devised a beautiful primality test for Mersenne numbers which is based on elliptic curves. The idea is to replace the multiplicative group of a finite field by the group of points of a suitable elliptic curve E over F_p. Here E is given by the Weierstrass equation y^2 = x^3 – 12x. This elliptic curve has complex multiplication, which makes the group of points over F_p easier to compute. It turns out that if p is a Mersenne prime then this group is cyclic of order p+1, which is exactly what one wants. Then successive squaring is replaced by the duplication map on the elliptic curve. Unfortunately, the formula for the duplication map on an elliptic curve is more complicated, so this test seems to be mainly interesting from a theoretical point of view.

Dear Prof. Tao,

Thank you for another interesting post. This is the clearest exposition of the Lucas-Lehmer test I have read. I think there is a typo about 8 lines after formula (8). In the formula following “Squaring a+b\sqrt{3}…” should be (a^2+3b^2+2ab\sqrt{3})…. Also 2 lines after that a^2-3b^2 instead of a^2=3b^2.

Also of couse in looking for Mersenne prime, one needs only consider Mersenne number n=2^m-1, where m is prime since 2^a-1 divides

 2^(ab)-1. _[Corrected – T.]_

Hello, I think there’s a small mistake in the text :

===

 Fermat’s little theorem (2) already gives a necessary condition for the primality of a candidate prime : take any a coprime to n (typically one picks a small number such as a = 2 or a = 3 ), and compute a^{n-1} modulo n . If it is not equal to 1, then p cannot be prime.

 ===

You probably meant n instead of p.

![Image 398: A 32x32 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=32&d=identicon&r=PG)
Great explanation!

As another possible justification for why people are searching for larger mersenne primes, there’s a clever construction of Locally Decodable Codes by Yekhanin that works in ![Image 399: \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D%2Fp%5Cmathbb%7BZ%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) where ![Image 400: p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) is a Mersenne prime. Since his bounds get better as ![Image 401: p](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=p&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) increases, he specifically cites the (then) largest Mersenne prime in his bounds.

Dear Terry,

Your posts on Mersenne Numbers and your following post about Galois groups and the order in the group gave me several insights for my proposed hypothesis. This hypothesis is that every prime number (in fact all integers) divide a Mersenne number. It is also true that every Mersenne number is a multiple of a prime and sometimes some Mersennes have more prime divisors.

One of the consequences of this is that the number of primes is almost equal to the number of Mersenne numbers. Almost equal because some Mersennes give off two primes and these Mersennes are those that have prime orders and themselves are composite e.g. M11, M23, and M47. And possibly some Mersennes whose order is a square e.g. M25 = 601 * 1801 * 31, both 601 and 1801 divides M25 as minimum Mersenne whereas 31 divides M5 (which is itself) therefore not the prime in question. There are almost an equal number of Mersennes and primes, primes are a bit more over some given range.

A further consequence is that there are infinite Mersennes, that is, for every integer there is corresponding Mersenne i.e. integer n means Mn therefore a new prime that divides that. Hence there are infinite primes.

Another consequence is that the distribution of Mersennes is a recurrence relation, Mnext = Mprevious *2 + 1, i.e. the present Mersennne is almost double the previous one. Therefore the ordering of Mersenne is so predictable and almost so ordered, given a range ‘n’ the number of Mersennes in that range is ‘log n’ on base 2. Then the number of primes in that range is also ‘log n’ almost. I believed this is what Friedrick Gauss has observed in the distribution of primes.

I am developing two major areas of research in factoring Mersennes:

(1) Following your post about discrete logarithms I realized that the first algorithm is exactly based on that – it looks for 2^x where the remainder is 1 modulo n or looking for a pair of 2^x and 2^y where there remainder is the same hence the cycle is a difference of x and y, the difference is actually either a multiple, equal or a fraction of this cycle.

(2) The other algorithm is base on the grammar of partitions. A good metaphor I used is the monetary system, as, some reason, almost everyone can calculate when money is involved. Imagine all notes or bills are doubles of the previous one. The smallest is a dollar ‘1’, next is 2 dollars, and so on – essentially the binary system. The question is, given a certain amount, can we break/partition the bills in such a way that the relationship of each adjacent bills (binary bits) forms a set of predefined law (grammatical laws)? The essence of these is that if a sentence (grammatical sentence) is formed or produced by these laws then we can find the factors of that amount. Prime number amounts do not produce well-formed sentences.

It is very hard to explain all the details of what I am doing. I only hope that it is clear enough for you to be able to understand a little of my work. There is of course much more that could be said about this.

I would be very grateful for any comments you could make.

Thanking you in anticipation.

Best

Jaime Montuerto

Dear Prof. Tao,

I have a question about the proof of

 your Lemma 1. You seem to assume that under the conditions

 of the lemma, automatically 3 is a non-square modulo q for

 any prime divisor q of n.

 How do you see that?

Dear Rene’,

Thanks for pointing that out! Actually, it turns out that the argument works just as well when 3 is a square modulo q (one simply replaces ![Image 405: F_q[\sqrt(3)]](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_q%5B%5Csqrt%283%29%5D&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) with ![Image 406: F_q](https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=F_q&bg=ffffff&fg=545454&s=0) in this case). I’ve modified the discussion to reflect this.

Dear Professor Tao,

I was working on the Mersenne primes and it appears there is “some pattern” in all the known Mersenne primes. I have verified it for the 46 known Mersenne Primes and it holds.

I am not sure if its something “easily provable” or we do have something that has gone unnoticed before.

Need to know if you would be interested to see the pattern/conjecture and comment on the same.

Thanks in advance.

Hi Sir,

Thanks for the proof. I’ll study it and see if it can help me.

I’m one of the crazy guys who contribute to the GIMPS project, since ages.

 I’ve contributed to checking the last 6 Mersenne primes, on a big Itanium2 machine, with the wonderful Glucas program written by Guillermo Ballester Valor.

I also spent a lot of time studying the LLT, reading E. Lucas books, HC Williams book about E. Lucas work, Ribenboim famous book about primes, and so on.

 I’ve also found some properties of Mersenne numbers and of the LLT, with proof of myself or by other people. Mq=(8x)^2-(3qy)^2. As an example for LLT, since it is not well known that the LLT can be used to prove that a Fermat number is prime (a number N such that N-1 is easily factorized), I wrote such a proof, based on Ribenboim technic and on Williams’ book.

 So, though I am an “amateur”, I have some knowledge of the LLT test.

The LLT test makes use of the tree that appears in the DiGraph under x^2-2 modulo a Mersenne prime (see Shallit & Vasiga for details). This DiGraph also has many cycles, of lengh dividing q-1. I found the formula that gives the number of cycles of lengh L, under x^2 and x^2-2 modulo a Mersenne prime. Someone else built the proof.

I also have conjectured a test that makes use of such a cycle of length q-1 (with a fix seed) instead of the tree (with seed 4). The main difference with the basic LLT test is that the last step of the iteration, instead of leading to 0 (mod Mq), leads to the seed of the iteration: S_0. Thanks to some help of Mr Williams, I’ve been able to prove that, if Mq is prime, then the property holds. But I failed finding a way to prove the reverse…

In short, the x^2-2 builds trees and cycles modulo a number. If the number is prime, there is symmetry. If the number is composite, then trees and cycles are not symmetric. My idea is that cycles can be used as the tree is used for proving that a number is prime.

This would not be very interesting to have another test for Mersenne numbers, since it would not be faster than LLT.

But Anton Vrba built a conjecture about using the same technique for a primality proof for Fermat 2^2^n+1 and Wagstaff (2^q+1)/3 numbers. And he provided a proof for the first (easy) part: a Prime number HAS this property.

About Wagstaff numbers, proving the conjecture would lead to a brand new primality test as efficient as the LLT is for Mersenne numbers. That would be the first VERY efficient test for a number not N-1 nor N+1. But Anton failed to prove the reverse… Some Mathematician contributing to the GIMPS Math forum think that, though it should be possible for the Mersenne, it does not seem possible to prove the conjecture for Wagstaffs. However, the DiGraph under x^2-2 modulo a Wagstaff prime only has cycles. No tree.

About Fermat numbers (tree and cycles), I guess (just a guess…) that it could be possible to build a test that could be used to prove that a Fermat number is NOT prime, much faster than running the full Pépin’s test. This could be possible since the Digraph under x^2-2 modulo a Fermat prime generates cycles of length dividing 2^n-1. I expect that a Fermat number that does not verify such a (much shorter) test could not be a prime. Just an idea… but it could help to know what is the status of F33.

So, there is here an area of research. Simply studying the properties of the cyles and trees for the Mersenne, Fermat and Wagstaff numbers under x^2 or x^2-2 would be very interesting, and useful for further reseach. It could be the subject of a study for a Math student (too hard for me…).

 Succeeding in proving the conjectures would be a great success !

If you are interested by this subject, just contact me at

 Tony

Thanks to the Vrba-Reix conjecture based on the ideas I talked previously in this page, and thanks to the version 3.8.0 of LLR by Jean Penné, I’ve been able to find a new Wagstaff PRP : (2^4031399+1)/3 , which is today the 3rd biggest PRP number ever found, with 1,213,572 digits. With a proof of Vrba’s conjecture, it would turn into a prime, the 22th biggest one.

I think one can even do with less magic than in the text. Suppose that $q=2^n-1$ is a Mersenne prime.

 Consider the field $F=F_{q^2}$ and recall that there is a homomorphism $n: F^\times \to F_q$ given by $N(x)=x\cdot x^q$, the norm. Let $N$ denote the kernel of this homomorphism, i.e. the subgroup of elements of norm 1.

 Then $N$ has order $p+1$ and is cyclic as it is a finite subgroup of the multiplicative group of a field.

 The magic of the Lucas-Lehmer test is that $2+\sqrt{3}$ is a generator for this group, regardless of which Mersenne prime we consider.

 But let me stress that the fact that there is such an element (of norm 1) follows from general theory.
