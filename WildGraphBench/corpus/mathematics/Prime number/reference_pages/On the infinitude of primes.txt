Since we have found 2’integers belonging to 2’(mod 2*)for each positive r less than s—1 and since,in addition,1 belongs to 2°and 2*—1 to 2!(mod 2*),we have accounted for all the 2*-!odd positive integers less than 2°.

For a given a;consider the 0,(z).We shall show that their periods constitute a set€1,such that e=[e1,eo,---,e|.Since a{=1(mod m)and therefore aj;=1(mod m,),each of the periods is a divisor of e.Let Z be the least common multiple of the periods.Then a’=1(mod m,),so that a’=1+/f,m,for some integer f,,for each r=1,2,---,k.Then fimi:=fom.==fime.But since the m,are relatively prime,each f,m,is divisible by m so that af’=1(mod m),and e|L.Thus the periods of the b,(mod m,)constitute a set€1,€2,°+,e such that e=[es,---,ex].

Conversely,every such set of exponents gives rise to an a;,namely a solution(mod m)of the simultaneous congruences a;=b,(mod m,),where b,has period e,(mod m,),r=1,2,---,k.

ON THE INFINITUDE OF PRIMES

Harry FurRSTENBERG,Yeshiva University

In this note we would like to offer an elementary“topological”proof of the infinitude of the prime numbers.We introduce a topology into the space of integers S,by using the arithmetic progressions(from—»to+©)asa basis.It is not difficult to verify that this actually yields a topological space.In fact,under this topology,S may be shown to be normal and hence metrizable.Each arithmetic progression is closed as well as open,since its complement is the union of other arithmetic progressions(having the same difference).As a result,the union of any finite number of arithmetic progressions is closed.Consider now the set A=UA,,where A,consists of all multiples of p,and p runs through the set of primes 22.The only numbers not belonging to A are—1 and 1,and since the set{—1,1}is clearly not an open set,A cannot be closed.Hence A is not a finite union of closed sets which proves that there are an infinity of primes.

A STATISTICAL DERIVATION OF A PAIR OF TRIGONOMETRIC INEQUALITIES

J.B.CHassan,Massachusetts Institute of Technology*The following inequalities and a particular generalization of them can be obtained by comparing the variances of a pair of minimum variance estimators

with the corresponding variances of certain less efficient estimators:+Given 6=(6;,02,---+,6,)such that and 0;¥6,for j#k.Then

*Operations Evaluation Group,Washington,D.C.

t So far as the author has been able to determine,the inequalities stated in this paper appear to be new.The statistics involved can be considered as respective pairs of estimators of the co ordinates of a fixed point in a plane,based on line-of-sight observations.The minimum variance estimators(under the conditions stated)are the coordinates of the point from which the sum of squares of the distances to each line-of-sight is a minimum.The less efficient estimators correspond to the estimate(of the location of the fixed point)obtained by averaging arithmetically the vectors determined by the intersections of all pairs of lines of sight.
