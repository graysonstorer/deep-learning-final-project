![Image 10: Book cover for The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon](http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4136/4782443565_c0da58a9ce_m.jpg)A few days ago, I discovered a book sitting on my spouse's bookshelves that I have long wanted to read. This book, Mark Haddon's _The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time_ (London: Jonathan Cape/Random House; 2004) [[Amazon UK](http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0099450259/livithescieli-21/) and [Amazon USA](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1400032717/livingthescie-20/)], is a fascinating and humorous coming-of-age story narrated by a 15-year-old autistic boy who uses his passion for mathematics and puzzle-solving to track down the person who murdered his neighbour's poodle with a pitchfork.

The author uses his narrator's revelations to provide the tone of this book, which reads like a diary. For example, the reader has barely started the book when the narrator, Christopher John Francis Boone, explains why he cannot tell a lie and doesn't understand jokes. While Christopher acknowledges that he is different from most people, he invests a tremendous amount of thought into trying to comprehend those differences, which is made plain through statements such as: "Prime numbers are what is left after you have taken all the patterns away. I think that prime numbers are like life. They are very logical but you could never work out the rules, even if you spent all your life thinking about them." [p. 15]

Early in the book, we learn that Christopher's mother died two years ago, so the story primarily focuses on the growing tension between him and his father, who inexplicably forbids Christopher from trying to learn who killed Wellington, his neighbour's poodle. We also learn that Christopher is determined to prove he "is not stupid" by taking his A level maths exam and predicting he will get an A grade and go on to attend university.

Christopher discusses his great admiration for Sherlock Holmes (but not Doctor Watson) and for Holmes' "power of detaching his mind at will" when concentrating. Explaining the plot devices in his favourite Sherlock Holmes book, _The Hound of the Baskervilles_, serves as a way for Christopher to explain the progress of his own detective work.

As the story progresses, we are introduced to those who are important to Christopher; his teacher Siobhan, who is his bridge to a world that is both mystifying and terrifying; Toby, his pet rat; and his neighbours, Mrs Shears (Wellington's owner) and Mrs Alexander. It is through Christopher's dispassionate and elaborate observations of these people that the reader soon becomes aware of the complex web of human relationships that is hidden from him in plain view.

Christopher is aware of his blind spot, so his observations emulate his determination to closely examine what he cannot understand. His attention to detail throughout the novel is astonishing, ranging from quietly numbering each chapter with sequential prime numbers to mentioning that one of the story's characters "smells of soap and wears brown shoes that have approximately 60 tiny circular holes in each of them." [p. 5]

But despite Christopher's powers of observation, he misses a lot, too. He dutifully reports everything he sees, undeterred by his knowledge that some details are important, whilst others are trivial. I found his lack of descriptions of people's faces to be quite striking (he states that he doesn't like looking at people's faces, and that they don't interest him).

Emotions are foreign concepts, so Christopher's reports of emotional outbursts are detailed but lack insight, so I was surprised to read that Christopher "felt happy" because he was "being a detective and finding things out" [p. 41]. Throughout the novel, the straightforward writing beautifully captures the underlying and growing tension between Christopher and his father and the world they inhabit, and this creates a similar tension in the reader.

As Christopher's detective work continues, puzzles and diagrams are included in the book. These provide additional insight into Christopher's thought processes and how he approaches his limitations. Yet, even though the reader becomes aware of the unfolding situation long before the narrator does, it is Christopher's reasoning and ingenious methods for dealing with the challenges encountered during his quest that surprise and delight. Subtle changes in the prose deftly capture Christopher's ongoing transformation during his journey. Sometimes, the reader glimpses Christopher's seeming wonder at how easy some tasks were to accomplish after he decided to face his fears.

This powerful novel gives the reader an appreciation for the tremendous struggle that Christopher is waging against the invisible impediments that hold him prisoner, his frustration with his inability to understand or to even perceive the subtleties of human behaviour, and his eventual triumph over his fears. This fascinating and amusing book is a captivating read for a commute or for a longer journey, but don't start reading it before you go to bed because you won't put it down until you've finished it! But even after you've closed this book, Christopher and his engaging story will stay with you far longer than it will take to read the book.

Unlike _CIOTDITNT_ and _A Spot Of Bother_, _Boom!_ is a children's book - not at all for adults.

> His third novel, Boom! was just published on 11 May 2010 [Amazon UK and Amazon USA].

It was published on 23 December 2009 by the way.

21 September 2010 9:29PM Sorry, did not read this book, I don't easily read fiction.

I did try to read bits of it but mostly it read like stuck-together stereotypes even though it is probably really well-written in some literary and so on senses.

If you read the scientific literature, carefully (with a lot of attention to the data, and less to interpretations), you'll find that autistics are lot more interesting and complex.

Your review is very clear and well-written and so on... but just to pick one thing, the assumption that for autistics "emotions are foreign concepts" is a good example of a powerful and harmful stereotype that has not stood up to any kind of scientific investigation.
