**The 17-year cicadas are about to emerge in force**

LIKE the climax of a bad sci-fi movie, a plague of biblical proportions will soon hit the eastern part of the United States. Not overgrown rabbits, nor killer tomatoes, but numberless insects. For sometime after May 10th (the exact date depends on the weather over the next few days), Brood X of the 17-year cicada will surface. The outbreak will be densest in the mid-west, around Indiana, where 3.5m insects per hectare are expected to emerge. But lesser plagues will hit places as far apart as Maryland and Missouri.

This insect storm will delight children, irritate adults (who have to clear up the mess), and ultimately do little harm—except to orchard owners, and those driven mad by the cicadas' incessant, piercing chorus. What it will also do, though, is provide an opportunity for entomologists to learn more about these curious creatures.

Though Brood X is the largest, it is only one of a number of broods of so-called periodical cicadas that emerge at intervals of either 13 or 17 years. This is the period of time that the cicada nymphs remain underground, feeding on sap from tree roots until their biological alarm-clocks go off. When that happens they all simultaneously mature, emerge, mate, lay eggs if female, and then die.

Most biologists believe that the odd lifestyle of periodical cicadas is an example of a survival strategy called “predator satiation”: the insects emerge in such prodigious quantities that predators cannot possibly eat them all. And their curious prime-numbered lifecycles may be another anti-predator strategy.

Glenn Webb, a mathematician at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, has demonstrated mathematically that prime-numbered lifecycles could help cicadas avoid damaging “resonances” with the two- and three-year population fluctuations of their predators. These would result in lots of predators being around in years when there were lots of prey. Dr Webb's model shows that, over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas. That may not sound like much, but it is enough to drive natural selection towards a prime-numbered life-cycle.

Only one predator—or, rather, parasite—is known to have overcome this anti-resonance strategy, by developing its own 17-year clock. _Massospora cicadina_, a fungus, lives in cicada larvae and passes between adults when they mate. But according to Gene Kritsky, an entomologist at the College of Mount St Joseph, in Cincinnati, Ohio, natural selection is working against this resonance too. In 2000, he recorded thousands of Brood X members emerging four years early—in other words, shifting to a 13-year cycle that _Massospora_ is not equipped to match. Lo and behold, when Dr Kritsky examined several dozen members of the “accelerated” Brood X that emerged in 2000, he found only one infected female among them, and she had but one fungal spore. By contrast, he found from 50 to 300 spores in each cicada female from another brood that emerged on time that year in North Carolina. Brood X, it seems, is splitting up, and a new 13-year cicada population is evolving.

Meanwhile, Keith Clay, of Indiana University in Bloomington, is studying the idea that periodical-cicada broods are getting bigger over the decades. Dr Clay's reasoning is that changes made to the vegetation of the eastern United States over the past century have created a habitat that is ideal for cicadas.

Female cicadas have to be careful when they choose a tree in which to lay their eggs. Those eggs are deposited in the tree's branches, but when they hatch (which they do two weeks after being laid), the resulting larvae fall to the ground and tunnel down to the tree's roots, from which they suck their sustenance. If a female chooses poorly and the tree dies in the next 17 years, her larvae will die too. They will also do badly if the tree has old, gnarled roots, rather than young, succulent ones.

Until the arrival of European settlers, most of the area the cicadas inhabit was forest—on the face of it, a good habitat for the insects. But Dr Clay's early research suggests that “suburban savannahs” (leafy avenues, lawns with the odd sapling growing in them, and golf courses) are actually better for the insects than the forests which preceded suburbanisation. Suburban trees tend to be younger and healthier. They also have to compete less fiercely for resources than trees in dense forests. And younger trees probably have tastier roots as well. The ancient forests of pre-Columbian America would not have provided such sumptuous dining.

Dr Clay's research builds on data that generations of Indiana's entomologists have been gathering at 17-year intervals for over a century. He estimates, though, that he will need results from at least three more Brood X outbreaks to draw firm conclusions about cicadas' habitat preferences. Like his forward-looking predecessors, he will have to rely on future generations of entomologists to ensure that his labours bear fruit. Many entomologists in the American mid-west, it seems, are also now on a 17-year cycle.
