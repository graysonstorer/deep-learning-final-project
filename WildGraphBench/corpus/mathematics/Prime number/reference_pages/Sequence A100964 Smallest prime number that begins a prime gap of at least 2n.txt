FORMULA

a(n) = prime([A144309](https://oeis.org/A144309 "a(n) is the index of the smallest prime such that the gap to the next prime is not less than 2*n.")(n)). - [Michel Marcus](https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Michel_Marcus), Nov 02 2013

EXAMPLE

a(5) = a(6) = a(7) = 113 because there is a gap of 14 between 113 and 127.
