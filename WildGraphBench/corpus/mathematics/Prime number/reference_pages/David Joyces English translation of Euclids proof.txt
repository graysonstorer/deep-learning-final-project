Proposition 20
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_Prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of prime numbers._
Let _A, B,_ and _C_ be the assigned prime numbers. 
I say that there are more prime numbers than _A, B,_ and _C._
Take the least number _DE_ measured by _A, B,_ and _C._ Add the unit _DF_ to _DE._
Then _EF_ is either prime or not.

First, let it be prime. Then the prime numbers _A, B, C,_ and _EF_ have been found which are more than _A, B,_ and _C._![Image 4: java applet or image](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookIX/propIX20.gif)
Next, let _EF_ not be prime. Therefore it is measured by some prime number. Let it be measured by the prime number _G._[VII.31](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVII/propVII31.html)
I say that _G_ is not the same with any of the numbers _A, B,_ and _C._
If possible, let it be so.

Now _A, B,_ and _C_ measure _DE,_ therefore _G_ also measures _DE._ But it also measures _EF._ Therefore _G,_ being a number, measures the remainder, the unit _DF,_ which is absurd.

Therefore _G_ is not the same with any one of the numbers _A, B,_ and _C._ And by hypothesis it is prime. Therefore the prime numbers _A, B, C,_ and _G_ have been found which are more than the assigned multitude of _A, B,_ and _C._
Therefore, _prime numbers are more than any assigned multitude of prime numbers._

#### Outline of the proof

 The statement says that there are more than any finite number _n_ of prime numbers. Suppose that _a_ 1, _a_ 2, ..., _a n_ are prime numbers. Euclid, as usual takes an specific small number, _n_=3, of primes to illustrate the general case. Let _m_ be the least common multiple of all of them. (This least common multiple was also considered in proposition [IX.14](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookIX/propIX14.html). It wasn't noted in the proof of that proposition that the least common multiple of primes is their product, and it isn't noted in this proof, either.) 
Consider the number _m_+1. If it's prime, then there are at least _n_+1 primes.

So suppose _m_+1 is not prime. Then according to [VII.31](http://aleph0.clarku.edu/~djoyce/java/elements/bookVII/propVII31.html), some prime _g_ divides it. But _g_ cannot be any of the primes _a_ 1, _a_ 2, ..., _a n_ , since they all divide _m_ and do not divide _m_+1. Therefore, there are at least _n_+1 primes.

Thus, there are not a finite number of primes.
