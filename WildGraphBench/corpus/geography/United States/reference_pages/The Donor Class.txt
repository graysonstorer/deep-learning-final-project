Most Americans realize that to a large extent you get what you pay for in Congress. But I doubt that many people are aware of just how elite and homogenous the donor class is. It's a tiny group -- just one-quarter of 1 percent of the population -- and it is not representative of the rest of the nation. But its money buys plenty of access.

''Congressional donors,'' according to a national study of individual campaign contributors, ''are overwhelmingly drawn from the most powerful and affluent groups in American society.''

The study, financed by the Joyce Foundation of Chicago, was based on a comprehensive survey of individuals who contributed $200 or more to Congressional candidates in 1996. (Smaller contributions do not have to be reported.)

Ninety-five percent of the contributors were white. Eighty percent were men. Eighty percent were over the age of 45, and nearly half were over 60. And 81 percent had annual family incomes higher than $100,000.

You want elite? Twenty percent of the donors had annual incomes higher than $500,000.

Say hello to the plutocracy.

Most American families earn well under $50,000 a year and are struggling to make ends meet. They may be concerned about such matters as health coverage and financing their children's education, but it's the guy in the knickers strolling off the golf course who gets to go to the clubhouse and ring up his Congressman.
