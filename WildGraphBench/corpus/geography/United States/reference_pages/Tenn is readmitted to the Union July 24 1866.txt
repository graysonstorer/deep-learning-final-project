Tenn. is readmitted to the Union July 24, 1866

On this day in 1866, Tennessee became the first Confederate state to be readmitted into the Union. The Volunteer State had also been the last one to withdraw from the Union, after a statewide referendum on June 8, 1861. 

 Angered by the withdrawal, Tennesseans from 26 eastern counties met twice in Greenville and Knoxville, eventually opting to secede from Tennessee and remain in the Union. The Legislature, however, denied their petition. It sent a 4,000-man force to suppress their bid to secede. During the Civil War, many East Tennesseans waged guerrilla warfare against the Southern cause by burning bridges, cutting telegraph wires and spying. 

 After the war, a week before its readmittance, Tennessee ratified the 14th Amendment, which guaranteed citizenship rights to former slaves. As a result, Tennessee became the sole state during Reconstruction that did not have an appointed military governor. 

 Many whites proved reluctant to offer blacks full citizenship rights, including the right to vote. Whites continued to control the state during Reconstruction; only two blacks were elected to the Legislature. But whites widely believed that Reconstruction had seriously harmed their interests. In 1868, the Nashville Republican Banner editorialized that “it has placed the black man over the white as the agent and prime-mover of domination.” 

 By the 1870s, whites sought to reclaim full political power, forming paramilitary groups to harass former slaves and their champions, suppress voting, and control labor markets. In 1889, a Democratic-controlled Tennessee General Assembly, under the guise of electoral reform, passed four laws disfranchising most blacks as well as many poor whites. The lawmakers thereby brought an end to what had been one of the most competitive Southern political systems in the immediate postwar period.
