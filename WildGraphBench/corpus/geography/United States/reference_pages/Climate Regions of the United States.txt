Knowing the best time to visit the United States is crucial: You don't want to get stuck hiking in the sweltering West Texas desert in the height of summer or get trapped in a snowstorm during a wintry trip to Vermont. For travelers planning to traipse around the United States, it can certainly help to become familiar with the country's major climate regions beforehand, as well as the average temperature of each if you want to enjoy your trip to the fullest.

Climates of the United States
-----------------------------

The U.S. is typically grouped into five different regions: the Northeast, the Southwest, the West, the Southeast and the Midwest. USA climate varies dramatically by region. The **Northeast** is characterized by a fairly diverse climate, with bitterly cold winters (that often bring extreme weather in the form of ice storms and snowstorms) and semi-humid summers, especially to the south. Average temperatures during winter often dip well below 0 degrees Fahrenheit. Along the **West Coast,** particularly the farther north you travel, you can expect cool, wet winters and dry, cool summers (and often very chilly evenings, with average temps dipping into the 50s and 60s). Meanwhile, the climate in the **Southeast** could be best described as humid and sub-tropical, with warmish winters and (very, very) hot summers; it's not uncommon for summer average temperatures to be over 100 degrees. And, the **Midwest** is similar in that summers are humid, although winters are usually much colder than in the Southeast.

Seasonal Travel by Region
-------------------------

Depending on the season and the region you're traveling to, your activities will likely differ greatly. In general, the **Northeast** is renowned for its showstopping fall foliage, so nature fans may want to plan their trip around seeing this explosion of color in person. Peak foliage typically occurs during the first three weeks of October, but this also depends on where you're going. The **Southwest** is definitely best seen before the heat and summer crowds descend on Death Valley and the Grand Canyon, so a springtime trip here (or wintertime, if you're okay with braving the cold) is perfect. Early- to mid-September is a great time to visit the **West**, since temperatures are mild and days are typically clear; plus prices have usually dropped after skyrocketing during the summer. Alternatively, summertime in the West is usually very mild compared to other parts of the country. Visiting the **Southeast** is best done between October and early April, before the heat becomes oppressive; the same goes for parts of the **Midwest**, as well. If you do decide to visit the Southeast during summertime, just make sure you're headed to the beach: Myrtle Beach, the Florida Keys and Gulf Shores are all lovely during this time of year.

The United States is a giant, geographically diverse country, and the climate varies dramatically depending on what region you're in, as well as the time of year. From Alaska's ice-cold temperatures that dip well below freezing to the extreme, arid heat in California's Death Valley, climes in the U.S. run the gamut from freezing cold to incredibly hot, and everything in between. Depending on the season, travelers can enjoy a range of activities that differ by region and climate.

Major Climate Zones and Weather
-------------------------------

New England, the Northeastern portion of the country, is characterized by mild, pleasant summer seasons and harsh, frigid winters with plenty of snowfall. Of course, the farther north you travel in New England, the colder it gets. The average temperature in summer in the Northeast is 69 degrees Fahrenheit, while the average wintertime temperature is 20 degrees.

Temperatures in the Midwest – including Minnesota, Kansas, Illinois and other states – tend to fluctuate drastically depending on the season. For instance, snow and subzero temperatures are common, but so are incredibly humid summers. America's South and Southeastern regions are characterized by fairly mild winter temperatures and hot summers, with temperatures routinely climbing well into the 90s. The American Southwest – California, parts of Colorado and Utah, New Mexico, Arizona and Nevada – is made up mostly of mountains, the coast and the desert, so temperatures there range toward the extremes. Desert summers can be unbearably hot, whereas winter in states like Utah and Colorado can be brutally cold. The coastal Southwest enjoys moderate temperatures that stay the same throughout the year, thanks to the Pacific Ocean.

The Northwest is the wettest part of the U.S.; most states in this region get more than their fair share of rainfall each year. In general, winters tend to be cold and wet, whereas summers are pleasant and never humid or overly hot.

Seasonal Activities and Travel Tips
-----------------------------------

**Spring** is a wonderful time to travel around the U.S., since this is considered to be the off-season, and you'll pay a lot less for lodging and activities than you would during the summer, regardless of where you go. New Orleans in springtime is magical, as long as you go before or after Mardi Gras. Check out the annual French Quarter Festival in April or the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, usually held in late April or early May. Washington, D.C., in springtime is gorgeous as well. Plan your visit there around the National Cherry Blossom Festival.

**Summer** equals beach vacations, no doubt about it. Ludington State Park in Michigan has amazing beaches, the Florida Keys are fabulous in the summer, and you can't go wrong with the amazing Hanauma Bay Nature Reserve in Hawaii. Or, alternatively, if you're craving mountains and woodsy nature, check out Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado; summer is the best time for hiking, fishing and camping there.

**Fall** is a beautiful time to visit the Northeast, particularly the wooded areas of Vermont and Maine. The foliage there is spectacular and known to be the best in the country. Don't discount other parts of the U.S., either. The Great Smokey Mountains and the Blue Ridge Mountains are especially colorful during this time of year. In addition, early fall is the perfect time to visit Mount Rainier National Park in Washington state since there are fewer crowds than in the summer, and the rainy season typically doesn't start until mid- to late October.

**Winter** is snowy wonderland season in many parts of the U.S. Head for Breckenridge, Colorado, or Park City, Utah, for incredible skiing. Or try all the winter sports your heart desires while staying at a luxurious resort in Lake Tahoe, California.
