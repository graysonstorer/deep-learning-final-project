R45805 Women’s Suffrage : Fact Sheet  

> Congressional Research Service 1

# Introduction 

The Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution granted women the right to vote. This 

right —known as women ’s suffrage —was ratified on August 18 , 1920 : “ The right of citizens of 

the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on 

account of sex. ”

As t he United States is preparing to celebra te the 100 th anniversary of the passage and ratification 

of the Nineteenth Amendment , statistics show that the number of female voters has exceeded the 

number of male voters in every presidential election since 1964 and that 73.7 million women 

voted in the 2016 presidential election .1

This fact sheet is designed to assist congressional offices with work related to the centennial . It 

contains a brief history of the women ’s movement; a legislative timeline; current Nineteenth 

Amendment legislation; and links to historical documents, selected resources, and 

commemorative events. This fact sheet will be updated as additional centennial information 

becomes available. 

# Brief Histor y

The first women ’s rights convention was held in 1848 in Seneca Falls, New York .2 The first 

organization advocating for suffrage “irrespective of race, color or sex ” was the Americ an Equal 

Rights Association, formed in 1866 .3 A few years later, the org anization split into two groups over 

disagreement s about the Fourteenth and soon -to -be Fifteenth Amendments. The National Woman 

Suffrage Association (NWSA) , out of New York, focused its efforts on securing women the vote 

th rough federal legislation, while the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA), based in 

Boston, approached the issue through state legislation. 4

In 1869, Wyoming became a territory and passed a bill giving women full voting rights. 5 It was 

nearly a quarter of a century before any other state afforded its women the right to vote. The first 

federal legislation proposing equal suffrage for men and women on t he basis of citizenship was in 

1868. The resolution was not debated; it “laid on the table. ”6 The first federal legislation 

proposing equal votin g rights specifically for women was in 1878, but the resolution was not 

ac ted upon until 1887 , when it was defeated in the Senate by a 16 -to -34 vote .

In 1890, the NWSA and the AWSA reunited to become the National American Wom an Suffrage 

Association, coordinating the national women ’s movement and finding success in individual 

st ates. Between 1893 and 1918, women won full or partial voting rights in 20 states. 7 At the

federal level, resolutions were proposed and hearings were held every few years, but there were 

no further votes on women ’s suffrage . On March 3, 1913 , thousands of women participated in a 

women ’s suffrage procession in downtown Washington , DC. They were met with resistance and 

could proceed only with the assistance of the U.S. Army. The treatment of the women drew 

worldwide attention and helped to reinvigorate the women ’s suffrage movement. 8 The House of 

Representatives passed and adopted a resolution for women ’s suffrage in early 1918. During that 

year, t he Senate held ex tensive debates and Pres ident Woodrow Wilson delivered a presidential 

address on the Senate flo or in sup port of voting rights for women. However, the resolution failed 

by narrow margins twice, before passing both c hambers of Congress in summer 1919. The 

proposed amendment , H.J.Res. 1, was then sent to the states for ratification. On August 18 , 1920 ,

Tennessee became the 3 6th state to approve the amendment. 9 On August 26, 1920, the U.S. 

Secretary of State verified that the required number of authenticated ratification documents had 

been received and added the Nineteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
