Notes: Not all indicators of the Global Innovation Tracker are used to calculate the Global Innovation Index. Long-term annual growth refers to the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the indicated period. For each variable, a one-year growth rate is set for the short run, and ten-year CAGR is set for the long run; time windows might differ when gaps exist in data availability. The end period corresponds to the most recent available observation, which may differ among countries. Temperature change is an exception: it indicates the change in degrees Celsius with respect to the average temperature in the countries. from 1951–1980. Figures are rounded.
