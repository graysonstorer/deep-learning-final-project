Energy Flow Charts:
===================

**Charting the Complex Relationships among

 Energy, Water, and Carbon**

Energy, Water, and Carbon Informatics
-------------------------------------

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) produced the first diagrams illustrating U.S. national commodity use in the mid-1970s. The most widely recognized of these charts is the[U.S. energy flow chart](https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/commodities/energy). LLNL has also published charts depicting[carbon (or carbon dioxide potential) flow](https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/commodities/carbon)and[water flow](https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/commodities/water)at the national level as well as energy, carbon, and water flows at the international, state, municipal, and organizational (e.g., Air Force) level.

Flow charts, also referred to as Sankey Diagrams, are single-page references that contain quantitative data about resource, commodity, and byproduct flows in a graphical form. These flow charts help scientists, analysts, and other decision makers to visualize the complex interrelationships involved in managing our nation’s resources.
