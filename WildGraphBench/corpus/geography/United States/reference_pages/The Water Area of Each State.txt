What percent of your state do you think is water covered? Which state has the highest percentage of water area? Is the West really "drier" than the rest of the country?

**•[Water Science School HOME](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school) •[Surface Water topics](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/surface-water-topics-0) •[Water Basics topics](https://www.usgs.gov/special-topic/water-science-school/science/water-basics-information-topic) •**

What percent of your state do you think is water covered? Which state has the highest percentage of water area? Is the West really "drier" than the rest of the country? The table below shows the total land area and water area of each state.

 Water area calculations in this table include only perennial water. All other water (intermittent, glacier, and marsh/swamp) is included in this table as part of land area calculations.

These water area data represent the sum of inland and coastal water and the Great Lakes. _The source of this data is the U.S. Census Bureau, [Geography: State Area Measurements](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography.html), 2010._

 Overview 

What percent of your state do you think is water covered? Which state has the highest percentage of water area? Is the West really "drier" than the rest of the country?

What percent of your state do you think is water covered? Which state has the highest percentage of water area? Is the West really "drier" than the rest of the country? The table below shows the total land area and water area of each state.

 Water area calculations in this table include only perennial water. All other water (intermittent, glacier, and marsh/swamp) is included in this table as part of land area calculations.

These water area data represent the sum of inland and coastal water and the Great Lakes. _The source of this data is the U.S. Census Bureau, [Geography: State Area Measurements](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/geography.html), 2010._
