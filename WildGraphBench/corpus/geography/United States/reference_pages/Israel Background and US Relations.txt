# SUMMARY 

# Israel: Background and U.S. Relations 

Since Israel’s founding in 1948, successive U.S. Presidents and many Members of Congress have 

demonstrated a commitment to Israel’s security and to close U.S. -Israel cooperation. Strong 

bilateral ties influence U.S. policy in the Middle East , a nd Congress provides active oversight of 

the executive branch ’s actions . Israel is a leading recipient of U.S. foreign aid and a frequent 

purchaser of major U.S. weapons systems. The two countries signed a free trade agreement in 

1985, and the United State s is Is rael’s largest trading partner. Legislation in Congress frequently 

includes proposals to strengthen U.S. -Israel cooperation. 

Israel has a robust economy and an active democracy . Israel has experienced a period of unprecedented political instability 

since April 2019. During this time, the country has held four elections with then -Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu facing 

criminal prosecution on political corruption charges. After the coalition government that replaced Netanyahu in June 2021 

broke down in June 2022, another election —the fifth round in four years —is scheduled to take place on November 1, 2022. 

With the collapse of the coalition , Israel’s prime minister changed from Naftali Bennett of the Yamina party (who had held 

the office since June 20 21) to Yair Lapid of the Yesh Atid party. Lapid is to serve in a caretaker capacity along with Israel’s 

other cabinet ministers until a new Knesset installs a new government. The elections and the subsequent government 

formation process are likely to be a showdown between Netanyahu’s Likud party and the parties inclined to support him, and 

Prime Minister Lapid and others across the political spectrum who oppose Netanyahu leading another government. Domestic 

debates in Israel have center ed on policies regard ing the Palestinians and Israel’s Arab citizens, as well as issues regarding 

the economy, religion, and the judiciary’s role .

Israel’s political impasse with the Palestinians continues. Biden Administration officials have said that they seek to preserve 

th e viability of a negotiated two -state solution to the Israeli -Palestinian conflict, while playing down near -term prospects for 

direct Israeli -Palestinian negotiations . Israel has militarily occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Arab -Israeli war , with the 

Palestinian Authority exercising limited self -rule in some areas since the mid -1990s . The Sunni Islamist group Hamas ( which 

the United States has designated as a terrorist organization) has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, and has clashed at times 

with Israel from there while also supporting unrest and violence elsewhere in the Israeli -Palestinian arena. Jerusalem and its 

holy sites continue to be a flashpoint , and the Trump Administration controversially recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital 

and mov ed the U.S. embassy there . In March 2022, Congress enacted legislation providing $1 billion in supplemental 

funding for the Iron Dome anti -rocket system af ter Israel heavily relied on Iron Dome during a May 2021 Gaza conflict. 

Israel may face challenges in improving difficult living conditions for Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza while ensuring 

its own security . Concerns about both points have shaped some debates in Congress about how Israel uses U.S. aid. 

Approximately 660 ,000 Israelis liv e in reside ntial neighborhoods or “settlements” in the West Bank and East Jerusalem .

These settlements are of disputed leg ality under international law. 

Concerns about Iran strongly affect Israel’s strategic calculations. The Israel i government has previously sought to influence 

U.S. policy on Iran’s nuclear program, and its officials have varying views about a possible U.S. return to the 2015 

international agreement. Meanwhile , Israel has made common cause with some Arab states to counter Iran’s regional 

activitie s, reportedly including growing cooperation on air defense . Israeli observers who anticipate the possibility of a future 

war similar in magnitude to Israel’s 2006 war against Iran’s ally Lebanese Hezbollah refer to skirmishes and covert actions 

since then involving Israel, Iran, and Iran’s allies as “the campaign between the wars.” A threat along Israel’s northern border 

persists from Hezbollah’s rocket arsenal and Iran -backed efforts to use Syrian bases and territory to bolster Hezbollah. 

Growing Israeli c ooperation with some Arab and Muslim -majority states led to the Abraham Accords : U.S. -brokered 

agreements in 2020 and 2021 to normalize or improve Israel’s relations with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, 

Morocco, and Sudan. Palestinian leaders decr y Arab normalization with I srael that happens before Palestinian national 

demands are met , and the Biden Administration has stated it wants further Israeli -Arab state normalization to occur alongside 

progress on Israeli -Palestinian diplomacy. 

U.S. official s regularly engage with Israeli interlocutors regarding their concerns about China and Russia (including Russia’s 

invasion of Ukraine) . Israel seeks to address these concerns while expand ing economic relations with China and avoiding 

Russian disruptions to Israeli military operations in Syria.

# Overview 

U.S. -Israel defense, diplomatic, and economic cooperation has been close for decades, based on 

common democratic values, religious affinities, and security interests . On May 14, 1948, the 

United States was the first country to extend de facto recognition to the state of Israel (see  Figure 

1). Subsequently, r elations have evolved through legislation , bilateral agreements, and trade.

Notes: According to the U.S. executive branch : (1) The West Bank is Israeli occupied with current status 

subject to the 1995 Israeli -Palestinian Interim Agreement; permanent status to be determined through further 

negotiation. (2) The status of the Gaza Strip is a final status issue to be resolved through negotiations. (3) The 

United States recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital in 2017 without taking a position on the specific boundaries 

of Israeli sovereignty. (4) Boundary representation is not necessarily authoritative. Additionally, the United States 

recognized the Golan Heights as part of Israel in 2019; however, U.N. Security Council Resolution 497, adopted 

on December 17, 1981, held that the area of the Golan Heights controlled by Israel’s military is occupied 

territory belonging to Syria. The current U.S. executive branch map of Israel is avail able at https://www.cia.gov/

explicit ly support its security. Such support is part of a regional security order —based heavily on 

U.S. arms sales to Israel and Arab countries —that has avoided major Arab -Israeli interstate 

conflict for nearly 50 years. Israel has provided benefits to the United States by sharing 

intelligence, military technology, and other innovations .

While Israel is the largest regular annual recipient of U.S. military aid, so me Members of 

Congress have sought greater scrutiny of some of Israel ’s actions. Some U.S. lawmakers express 

concern about Israel ’s use of U.S. military assistance against Palestinians, in light of entrenched 

Israeli control in the West Bank and around the Gaza Strip, and diminished prospects for a 

negotiated Israeli -Palestinian two -state solution. A few seek oversight measures and legislation to 

distinguish certain Israeli actions in the West Bank and Gaza from general U.S. support for Israeli 

security. 1

Since U.S. aid to Israel significantly increased in the 1970s in connection with Israel ’s peace 

treaty with Egypt, developments in international trade have impacted Israel ’s relations with the 

United States and other global actors. During that time, Israel ’s economy has gone from that of a 

developing nation to one integrated into and on par with economies in Western countries, fueled 

by a booming high -tech industry and other scientific fields that attract worldwide investment and 

trade. Leveraging its milita ry power, arms export capacity, and economic and technical strengths, 

Israel has deepen ed its relations with India and China as well as other countries in Asia, Africa, 

and Latin America. 

After the Cold War ended, the Middle East became more central to U.S . policy, especially after 

the September 11, 2001, Al Qaeda terrorist attacks on the U.S. homeland. Consequently , U.S. -

Israel ties focused more on regional challenges —including those from various terrorist groups 

and Iran. Some changes in U.S. military pos ture and political emphasis in the region could affect 

Israeli assessments regarding the need for action independent from the United States . The United 

States helped Israel negotiate the Abraham Accords in 2020 and 2021 to normalize or improve 

Israel ’s rel ations with various Arab and Muslim -majority states (see “The Abraham Accords ”), 

and Is rael has taken some steps without direct U.S. involvement to str engthen relations with other 

Abraham Accords states such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Within this context, President 

Biden has reemphasized the longtime U.S. commitment to Israel ’s security (see “U.S. -Israel 

Security Cooperation ”) .

Iran continues to be a top Israeli security concern (see “Countering Iran ”) . Israel has sought to 

influence U.S. policy on Iran , including the approach to Iran ’s nuclear program and deterrence of 

Iran -backed actors in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, the Gaza Strip, and Yemen. Israeli officials welcome d

the U.S. withdrawal i n 2018 from the international agreement on Iran ’s nuclear program (known 

as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA) and accompanying reimposition of U.S. 

sanctions on Iran ’s core economic sectors . They seek to coordinate with U.S. counterparts on 

future action to prevent Iranian progress toward a nuclear weapon, whether or not the United 

States reenters the JCPOA or negotiates a separate international agreement . Low -level Israel -Iran 

conflict and covert rivalry persists in various settings —Iran it self, countries bordering Israel, 

cyberspace, and international waters. 

In the Israeli -Palestinian conflict, political disputes persist over key issues including security 

parameters, Israel -West Bank borders, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees, and the status of

Jerusalem (see “Israeli -Palestinian Issues and U.S. Policy ”) . Polls suggest wide spread skepticism 

among the Israeli public about prospects for a negotiated end to the conflict. 2 This skepticism 

fuels speculation and debate about Israeli alternatives such as indefinitely controlling or annexing 

West B ank areas, improving Palestinian living c onditions and economic prospects to reduce 

tensions , or focusing more on building relations with Arab states .

Israel seeks to balance various considerations regarding China and Russia . It s leaders have taken 

some steps to address U.S. concerns regarding Ch ina ’s possible mis use of Israeli technology or 

access to I sraeli infrastructure (see “China: Invest ments in Israel and U.S. Concerns ”) , and 

Russia ’s inv asion of Ukraine (see text box below) . Yet, many leading Israeli government and 

business figures also favor maintain ing a strong economic relationship with China , and Israeli 

security decision makers have an interest in avoid ing Russian disruptions to Israe l’s ability to act 

militarily in Syria. 

Russia’s Invasion of Ukraine 

The  Israel i government  has publicly condemned Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine through statements and votes in 

international fora. Meanwhile, it has sought to provide political support for Ukraine and humanitarian relief for 

Ukrainians —including allowing  around  35,000 Jewish a nd non -Jewish refugees to enter Israel —without alienating 

Russia. 3 About 1.2 million (around 15%) of Israel’s population are Russian speakers with family origins in the 

former Soviet Union. 4

Since 2015, Russia’s military presence and air defense capabiliti es in Syria have given it influence over Israel’s ability 

to conduct airstrikes there (see “ Syria ”). Israel has used access to Syrian airspace to targe t Iranian personnel and 

equipment, especially those related to the transport of munitions or precision -weapons technology to Iran’s ally 

Hezbollah in Lebanon. 5 To date, Israel has refrained from providing lethal assistance to Ukraine or approving 

third -par ty transfers of weapons with proprietary Israeli technology. 6 Under some Western pressure, Israel has 

contemplated providing defensive equipment, personal combat gear, and/or warning systems to Ukraine’s military, 

partly to project to existing arms export clients that it would be a reliable supplier in crisis situations. 7 Israel 

announced an initial shipment of helmets and flak jackets to Ukrainian rescue forces and civilian organizations in 

May 2022. 8

Israel is a parliamentary democracy in which the prime minister is head of government (see text

president, Isaac Herzog, took office in July 2021 . Israel does not have a written constitution. 

Instead, Basic Laws lay down the rules of government and enumerate fundamental rights. Israel 

has an independent judiciary, with a system of magistrates ’ courts and district courts headed by a 

Supreme Court. 

The political spectrum is highly fragmented, with small parties exercising disproportionate power 

due to the relatively low vote threshold for entry into the Knesset (3.25%), and larger parties 

needing small -party support to form and maintain coalition governments. In 2014 , howeve r, the 

Knesset tightened the conditions for bringing down a government through a dispersal or no -

confidence vote .9

Primer on Israeli Electoral Process and Government -Building 

Elections  to Israel’s 120 -seat Knesset are direct  and proportional based on a party list system, with the entire 

country constituting a single electoral district. All Israeli citizens age 18 and older may vote. Turnout in elections 

since 2001 has ranged between 62% and 72% of registered voters (before th at it generally ranged between 77% 

and 80%). Elections  must be held at least every four years, but are often held earlier due to difficulties in holding 

coalitions together.  A Central Elections Committee  headed by a Supreme Court justice, with representati ves from 

parties in the Knesset,  is responsible for conducting and supervising the elections. 

National laws provide parameters for candidate eligibility, general elections, and party primaries —including specific 

conditions and limitations on campaign cont ributions and public financing for parties. 10  Since 2007, a “cooling -off 

law” requires that senior Israeli military officers wait at least three years before entering civilian politics. 11 

Following elections, Israel’s president  gives the task of forming a g overnment  to the Knesset member the 

president believes has the best chance to form a government as prime minister. The would -be prime minister has 

28 days to assemble a coalition, and the president can extend this period for an additional 14 days , with pro visions 

allowing the president to authorize others to form a government if the initial selectee is unsuccessful in the task .

The government and its ministers are installed following a  successful  vote of confidence  in the Knesset .

Thereafter, t he  ministers  determine the government’s course of action on domestic issues, while  a “security 

cabinet” (formally known as the Ministerial Committee on Defense) largely directs  military and national security 

action s. The security cabinet consists  of  a group of key mini sters —some whose membership is set by law, others 

who are appointed by the prime minister —who number no more than half of all cabinet ministers .12 

A number of factors distinguish Israel from the United States and other developed countries, 

including the re gional threats it faces, its unique historical experience, and its population ’s

relatively higher level of direct military service. 13 In Israel ’s domestic politics, right -of -center 

parties skeptical of compromise with the Palestinians and influenced by reli gious nationalism 

have supplanted the center -left, more secular Labor movement as the dominant force in the 

country. See  Appendix A  for historica l background .

criminal prosecution on political corruption charges. After the coalition government that replaced 

Netanyahu in June 2021 broke down in June 2022 (as discussed below) , anoth er election —the 

fifth round in four years —is scheduled to take place on November 1, 2022 . With the collapse of 

the coalition , Israel ’s prime minister changed from Naftali Bennett of the Yamina party (who had 

held the office since June 2021) to Yair Lapid o f the Yesh Atid party. Lapid is to serve in a 

caretaker capacity along with Israel ’s other cabinet ministers (see  Table 1) until a new Knesset 

installs a new government. Bennett, as alternate prime minister, is to maintain significant 

responsibility for Iran -related issues , but he has announced that he will not r un in the fall election .

Over these past four years , Israel ’s efforts at establishing political leadership have unfolded as 

follows . Netanyahu was selected by Israel ’s president as the Knesset member best situated to 

form a government after both th e April 2019 and September 2019 elections , but was unable to do 

so in either case —the first time such a stalemate had occurred in Israel. After the March 2020 

election, Netanyahu formed a power -sharing government in May 2020 with Benny Gantz ’s Kahol 

Lavan party , but the government collapsed later that year over a failure to pass a national budget. 

The resulting election in March 2021 led to the replacement of Netanyahu ’s government by a 

wide -ranging but fractious coalition of parties in June 2021 (see  Appendix B ). While Bennett —a

right -of -center figure —served as prime minister of this power -sharing government, the centrist 

Lapid played a leading role in arranging the coalition. 

In June 2022, the Netanyahu -led opposition in the Knesset withheld its support for a bill to renew 

the application of certain aspects of civilian law to Israeli settlers in the West Bank, and the bill 

failed to p ass after two members of Bennett ’s Yamina party left the coalition in hopes of bringing 

a more right -leaning government to power. To trigger an automatic renewal of the civilian laws ’

application to West Bank settlers, Bennett and Lapid got the Knesset to dissolve the coalition and 

vote for the election now scheduled for the fall . Under the government ’s power -sharing 

agreement, once the Knesset voted for a new election , Lapid (see text box below for a brief 

biography) became Israel ’s caretaker prime ministe r because members of Bennett ’s party were 

responsible for the coalition ’s demise. Israel: Background and U.S. Relations

Prime Minister Yair Lapid : Biography 

Lapid , born in 19 63 , transitioned from a successful media career to politics in 2013, when he 

founded the centrist, pro -secular Yesh  Atid (There is a Future) party . His father Tommy was 

also a media  personality -turned -politician who  led the Shinui  (Change)  party in the Knesset 

from 1999 -2006 and served briefly as justice minister. 

In the 2013 election, Yesh Atid had a surprising secon d-place finish and Lapid served as finance 

minister in the Netanyahu -led government from 2013 to 2015. Subsequently,  Lapid  has avoided 

allying with Netanyahu, and Yesh Atid appears to have displaced the Labor party as the leading 

political option for Israe lis who do not support right -of -center parties .

Lapid and Yesh Atid joined a combined list with Benny Gantz’s Kahol Lavan  to oppose Netanyahu  for  three 

straight elections beginning in April 2019 , but split from Kahol Lavan when Gantz formed a power -sharing 

government with Netanyahu  in May 2020 . After Yesh Atid’s second -place finish in the March 202 1 election, then -

Israeli President Reuven Rivlin chose Lapid as the Knesset member best positioned to form a government.  He 

established a power -sharing government  in June 2021 featuring eight parties across Israel’s political spectrum, 

serving as foreign minister and alternate prime minister  as part of a rotation agreement  with  Prime Minister 

Naftali Bennett of the Yamina party . Under the power -sharing agreement, L apid became caretaker prime minister 

in Ju ly  2022  after  members of Yamina caused the government’s dissolution.  In conducting Israel’s foreign policy 

since June 2021,  Lapid, Bennett, and Gantz have avoided major military conflict to date while  supporting ef forts to 

counter Iran, including  in coordination  with  the United States and various A rab countries .

While he is  constrained from major political initiatives while serving in a caretaker capacity,  Lapid favors a two -

state solution to the Israeli -Palestinian  conflict, 14  and has expressed opposition to West Bank settlement 

construction that could  impede  such a solution —particularly in isolated areas  away from settlement blocs closer 

to Israel. 15  In past public statements, Lapid has said that he would not accept  dividing Jerusalem with  the 

Palestinians. 16 

The election s and the subsequent government formation process are likely to be a showdown 

between Netanyahu ’s Likud party and the parties inclined to support him , and Prime Minister 

Lapid ’s Yesh Atid party and others across the political spectrum who oppose Netanyahu leading 

another government. The previous coalition achieved little consensus on controversial subjects —

the Palestinians , how to balance judicial review and majority rule, and religion ’s role in the state .

Nevertheless, Lapid and Bennett maintain that this coalition competently addressed important 

issues such as Iran, the budget, and the COVID -19 crisis. 17 

Netanyahu ’s trial is ongoing and may continue for years without legally preventing him from 

leading a government. S ome observers speculate that he might be open to political compromises 

with other parties in return for measures to end or disrupt his prosecution , even though Netanyahu 

denies this .18 Such compromises could include efforts to increa se formal I sraeli control over parts 

of the West B ank and reduce the judiciary ’s power over legislation or government action. 

Itamar Ben Gvir and his Otzma Yehudit (Jewish Power) party are possible Likud coalition 

partners —perhaps as part of a broader Rel igious Zionism electoral list —and have links with a

Jewish ultra -nationalist movement based on the ideology of Meir Kahane (1932 -1990) .19 Kahane 

served in the Knesset from 1984 until 1988, when his party was banned from elections after Israel 

passed legislation disqualifying those who incite racism . The U.S. government has designated a

Kahanist group ( Kahane Chai ) as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist entity, even though the 

government de -listed the group as a Foreign Terrorist Organization i n 20 22 due to its inactivity .20 

The following could be significant factor s regarding the elections and government formation 

process: 

 Another stalemate? Initial polling suggests that Likud will probably win more votes 

than any other party, but pro - and anti -Netanyahu blocs may both have difficulty 

achieving Knesset support to form a government. 21 In such an event, Lapid and other 

caretaker officials might continue in their positions through multiple election rounds, as 

Netanyahu did when serving in a care taker capacity from December 2018 until May 

2020. 

 Potential game changers. The electoral math could change if some parties near the 

electoral threshold fall beneath it, or, alternatively, run with one or more other parties as a 

combined list. Other changes could come from key political figure s enter ing or depart ing 

the political sc ene, or making new alignments . The political future of the Yamina party 

without Bennett is in question. 22 Also, Gadi Eizenkot, a prominent retired general and 

former Israel Defense Forces chief of staff, is reportedly considering running alongside 

Lapid. 23 Leaders of the Kahol Lavan, New Hope, and Yisrael Beitenu parties all currently 

oppose sitting in government with Netanyahu, but also have a history of working with 

him. 

 Arab -led p arties. As in the previous government, Arab -led parties could be decisive in 

determining future political outcomes. The Islamist United Arab List (UAL or Ra ’am) 

was the first independent Arab party to join an Israeli government when it joined the 

Lapid -Ben nett coalition in June 2021 .24 The Joint List (made up of three smaller parties 

with socialist or nationalist leanings) has stayed aloof from the pro - and anti -Netanyahu 

blocs to date. Voter turnout among Arab citizens of Israel has fluctuated between 45% 

and 65% in the past four elections, 25 and could determine whether UAL reaches the 

electoral threshold , while also generally affecting Arab -led parties ’ ability to influence 

government formation or critical legislation. 26

Major Domestic Issues 

The following subjects generate domestic debate in Israel .

Arab Citizens of Israel 

While most Arabs living in Israel —many of whom identify as Palestinians —are citizens with the 

right to vote and organize politically , they are largely segreg ated from Jewish communities. 27 

Their neighborhoods have comparatively higher levels of crime and lower levels of income, 

education, and infrastructure and service provision. Arab Israelis were subject to martial law from 

Israel ’s founding in 1948 until 1966, and unlike the ir Jewish, Druze, or Circassian counterparts in 

Israel , they do not have a compulsory military service requirement. 28 Leading Arab political 

figures strongly opposed Israel ’s controversial 2018 Basic Law defining Israel as the national 

homeland of the Jewis h people, 29 while observers have debated the law ’s symbolism and 

substance. 30 

Due partly to the influence of UAL leader Mansour Abbas within the previous government 

coalition, the 2021 -2022 budget includes an agreement to allocate more than $10 billion over the 

next five years to address Arab -Jewish disparities in Israel and other concerns Arabs face .31 Arab -

led parties also side with Arab Bedouins who claim that the government does not properly 

account for the long -established Bedouin way of life by implement ing land use policies seeking 

to uproot Bedouins from villages not formally recognized under Israeli law in Israel ’s southern 

Negev desert. 32 

Violent crime in largely Arab -populated cities has become an increasing concern. While it most 

directly impacts Ara b residents, unrest in these cities during the May 2021 Israel -Gaza conflict 

demonstrated the potential for violence to affect Arab -Jewish interactions as well. The 

government ’s $10 billion funding plan for Arab issues includes $760 million toward security and 

economic measures to deter criminals , while also addressing socioeconomic root causes. Yet, 

some Arab leaders express skepticism that these measures can significantly stem the illegal 

weapons trade that fuels crime .33 In October 2021, the government sa id that Israel ’s military and 

the Israel Security Agency (Shin Bet or Shabak) (see  Table 2) would participate in efforts to 

reduce crime in A rab -populated areas. Arab Israeli leaders have publicly disagreed about 

involving these national security branches , which are subject to les s constraint and oversight than 

the police .34

Other Issues 

 Relationship between religion and state . Secular and religious Jewish Israelis 

have traditionally differed on how to apply Jewish religious law in various 

aspects of Israeli society. A major issue fo r several years has been whether to 

require military conscription for the majority of Haredim (ultra -Orthodox Jews) 

who claim exemptions for religious study. A draft Knesset bill, if passed, would 

generally preserve exemptions for Haredim who agree to voca tional training. 35 

The previous coalition had contemplated liberalizing state kashrut (kosher 

certification and supervision) and c onversion practices ,36 with some kashrut 

reforms phasing in during 2022 as part of the 2021 -2022 budget deal. 37 Other 

proposals, such as providing access to civil marriage or public transportation on 

the Sabbath , are likely to remain unresolved at least until a new government 

comes into office . Additionally, t he government has not agreed to date on a 

compromise for a mixed -gender pr ayer space at the Western Wall plaza in 

Jerusalem ’s Old City .38 

 Judicial and other checks on majority rule . Many right -of -center political 

figures in Israel have publicly bemoaned checks on popular opinion and majority 

rule, including in connection with leg al proceedings against former Prime 

Minister Netanyahu. During Netanyahu ’s time in office, his government 

proposed a law in 2018 to limit judicial review over legislation .39 The previous 

coalition made some efforts at the committee level to explore drafting a Basic 

Law that would provide clearer constitutional guidance for Israel, including on 

judicial review of laws and possible Knesset override authority .40 

# Economy 

Israel has an advanced industrial, market economy in which the government plays a substantia l

role. Despite limited natural resources, the agricultural and industrial sectors are well developed. 

The engine of the economy is an advanced high -tech sector, including aviation, communications, 

computer -aided design and manufactures, medical electronic s, and fiber optics. Israel still 

benefits from loans, contributions, and capital investments from the Jewish diaspora, but 

economic strength has lessened its dependence on external financing. 

Aside from a moderate 2020 slump and robust 2021 recovery durin g the COVID -19 pandemic, 

over the past five years Israel ’s economy has shown steady growth (around 3 -5% annually). 

International Monetary Fund (IMF) growth projections remain in a similar range for the next five 

years, with inflation and unemployment expectations remaining generally low. 41

Bilateral Trade 

The United States is Israel’s largest single -country trading partner, 42  and —according to  2021  data from the U.S. 

Census Bureau and Bureau of Economic Analysis —Israel is the United States’s 24 th -largest  trading partner. 43  The 

two countries concluded a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in 1985,  eliminating  all customs duties between the two 

trading par tners . The FTA includes provisions that protect both countries’ more sensitive agricultural sub -sectors 

with nonta riff barriers, including import bans, quotas, and fees.  Qualifying  Industrial Zones (QIZs) in Jordan and 

Egypt are considered part of the U.S. -Israel free trade area. 44  In 20 21 , Israel imported approximately $12. 8 billion 

in goods from and exported $ 18.7  bi llion in goods to the United States. 45  The United States and Israel have 

launched several programs to stimulate Israeli industrial and scientific research, for which Congress has authorized 

and appropriated funds on several occasions. 46 

Although Israel ’s overall macroeconomic pro file and fiscal position appear favorabl e, its relative 

poverty levels are the fifth highest within the 37 -country Organisation of Economic Cooperation 

and Development (OECD). 47 Israeli Haredim (ultra -Orthodox Jews) and Arabs are particularly at 

risk, with nearly half of both groups living in material poverty .48 

# Military and Security Profile 

General Overview 

Israel maintains conventional military superiority relative to its neighbors and the Palestinians. 

Shifts in re gional order and evolving asymmetric threats have led Israel to update its efforts to 

project military strength, deter attack, and def end its population and borders. Israel also has 

developed advanced missile defense systems and reported cyber defense capa bilities. 

According to estimates from Jane s, Israel ’s military (see  Table 2 for descriptions of various 

Israeli security forces) features total active duty manpower across the army, navy, and air force of 

approximately 180,000, plus 445,000 in reserve —numbers aided by mandatory conscription for 

most young Jewish Israeli men and women, followed by extended reserve duty. Israel ’s overall 

annual defense bud get is approximately $ 17.6 billion, constituting about 3.7 % of its total gross 

domestic product (GDP). 49  

> 42

Accor ding to the European Commission’s Directorate -General for Trade, for 2021 the countries of the European 

Union accounted for 29.9% of Israel’s total trade volume, while the United States accounted for 16.4% and China

that the U.S. defense budget totals close to $759 billion annually, constituting approximately 3.3% of total GDP. The 

World Bank, citing data from the Stockholm International Peace Research In stitute, states the following figures for 

defense spending as a percentage of GDP in other key Middle Eastern countries as of 2020: Egypt -1.2%, Iran -2.2%, 

Iraq -4.1%, Jordan -5.0%, Lebanon -3.0%, Saudi Arabia -8.4%, Turkey -2.8%, United Arab Emirates -5.6%.

Israel has a robust homeland security system featuring sophisticated early warning practices, 

thorough border and airport security controls, and reinfor ced rooms or shelters engineered to 

withstand explosions in most of the country ’s buildings. Israel also has proposed and partially 

constructed a national border fence network of steel barricades (accompanied at various points by 

watch towers, patrol roads , intelligence centers, and military brigades) designed to minimize 

militant infiltration, illegal immigration, and smuggling from Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan , and 

the Gaza Strip. 50 

Some observers cited in State Department reporting on human rights characterize certain Israeli 

security measures, including administrative detention s that affect many Palestinians, as violations 

of human rights or due process norms .51 Israeli authorities justify administrative detention to 

prevent imminent attacks or to d etain suspects without releasing sensitive i nformation, 52 and the 

practice is subject to Israeli leg al standards .53

Presumed Nuclear Capability 

Israel is not a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) and maintains a policy of 

“nuclear opacity ” or amimut . One report estimate s that Israel possesses a nuclear arsenal of 

around 90 warheads .54 The United Sta tes has countenanced Israel ’s nuclear ambiguity since 1969, 

when Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir and U.S. President Richard Nixon reportedly reached an 

accord whereby both sides agreed never to acknowledge Israel ’s nuclear arsenal in public. 55 Israel 

might have nuclear weapons deploya ble via aircraft, submarine, and ground -based missiles. 56 No 

other Middle Eastern country is generally thought to possess nuclear weapons. 

# U.S. -Israel Security Cooperation 

U.S. -Israel security cooperation —a critical part of the bilateral relationship —is mul tifaceted. U.S. 

law requires the executive branch to take certain actions to preserve Israel ’s “qualitative military 

edge, ” or QME over neighboring militaries, and expedites aid and arms sales to Israel in various 

ways . Israel relies on advantages in equip ment and training to compensate for neighboring 

countries ’ advantages in population and territorial size .

U.S. military aid has helped transform Israel ’s armed forces into one of the most technologically 

sophisticated militaries in the world. Congress ’s au thorization for Israel to use a portion of this 

aid for off shore procurement (OSP) from Israeli defense companies (OSP is currently being 

phased out and is scheduled to end in FY2028) has helped Israel build a domestic defense 

industry, and Israel in turn is one of the top exporters of arms worldwide. 57 The United States and 

Israel also regularly conduct joint exercises and consultations, and often cooperate in developing 

military technology, with the U.S. military using or adapting a number of Israel -origi n items. 58 

Sensitive Technology and Intelligence Issues 

Arms sales, information sharing, and technical collaboration between the United States and Israel raise questions 

about what Israel might do with capabilities or information it acquires. The United States and Israel have regularly 

discussed Israel’s dealin gs on sensitive security equipment and technology with various countries,  such as in the 

past with  China.  Sources have reported that the United States has established de facto veto power over Israeli 

third -party arms sales. 59  In a t least three cases  since t he 1980s, U.S. courts have convicted  U.S.  government 

employees  of disclosing classified information to Israel or of conspiracy to act as an Israeli agent. 60

U.S. officials routinely express their commitment to Israel ’s security. The United States and Israel 

do not have a mutual defense treaty or agreement that provides formal U. S. security guarantees .

They do, however, have a Mutual Defense Assistance Agreement in effect (TIAS 2675, dated July 

23, 1952) regarding the provision of U.S. military equipment to Israel , and have entered into a 

range of stand -alone agreements, memoranda of understanding, and other arrangements varying 

in their formality. The U.S. -Israel Enhanced Security Cooperation Act ( P.L. 112 -150 ) of 2012 and 

U.S. -Israel Strategic Par tnership Act ( P.L. 113 -296 ) of 2014 encouraged continued and expanded 

U.S. -Israel cooperation in a number of areas, including defense, homeland security, cyber issues, 

ener gy, and trade. The latter act designated Israel as a “major strategic partner ” of the United 

States —a designation whose meaning has not been further defined in U.S. law or by the 

executive branch. 

A 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding (MOU) —signed in 2016 —

commit s the United States to annually provide Israel $3.3 billion in Foreign Military Financing 

(FMF) and $500 million on joint missile defense programs from FY2019 to FY2028, subject to 

congressional appropriations. The MOU anticipates possible supplemental aid in emergency 

situations such as conflict. In March 2022, Congress appropriated $1 billion in supplemental 

funding through FY2024 for the Iron Dome anti -rocket system as a response to the system ’s

heavy use during a May 2021 conflict between Israel and Gaza Strip -based groups such as Hamas 

and Palestine Islamic Jihad (PIJ) (both of which are Sunni Islamist groups allied with Iran and 

U.S. -designated terrorist organizations). 

Specific figures and comprehensive detail regarding various aspects of U.S. aid and arms sales to 

Israel are discussed in CRS Report RL33222, U.S. Foreign Aid to Israel , by Jeremy M. Sharp .

That report includes information on conditions that gen erally allow Israel to use its military aid 

earlier and more flexibly than other countries in each fiscal year. 

# Israeli -Palestinian Issues and U.S. Policy 

# Overview of Disputes and Diplomatic Efforts 

The Biden Administration and the 117 th Congress have cont inued longstanding U.S. engagement 

on the Israeli -Palestinian conflict, which has been a persistent subject of international concern for 

decades since the first Arab -Israeli war in 1948. Israel gained control of the West Bank (including 

East Jerusalem) and the Gaza Strip during the June 1967 Arab -Israeli war (also known as the Six -

Day War). For historical background on the conflict, see CRS Report RL34074, The Palestinians: 

Background and U.S. Relations , by Jim Zanotti .

In the 1990s, after the end of the Cold War and first Gulf War, Israel and the Palestine Liberation 

Organization (PLO) agreed to work toward a diplomatic resolution of key issues of Israeli -

Palestinian dispute, including security parameters , borders, Jewish settlements, Palestinian 

refugees, and the status of Jerusalem. Per the Oslo agreements, the PLO came out of exile and 

accepted limited self -rule in parts of the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip in the form of a new 

Palestinian National Au thority, or Palestinian Authority (PA), that formally adopted democratic 

means of governance. In the almost 30 years since, the two sides have engaged in a mix of 

interactions that include occasional U.S. -brokered negotiations, a combination of practical 

coordination and political contention, and competing efforts to enlist international support. To 

date, the key issues of dispute remain unresolved. 

Within a context of overarching Israeli control, multiple outbreaks of violence have occurred 

between Israel is and Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem. After some PA authorities 

became directly involved in violence against Israel during the 2000 -2005 second Palestinian 

intifada (“ uprising ”) under the rule of iconic Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat (who d ied in 2004), 

Israel heightened security measures in and around the West Bank and sensitive parts of Jerusalem. 

These measures have included the controversial construction of a partial West Bank barrier (see 

“Settlements ”) .

With U.S. help, Israel cultivated closer security cooperation with the PA after the second intifada 

under Arafat ’s successor as president, Mahmoud Abbas. However, Abbas ’s pub lic stance against 

using PA security forces against Israel may have increased his domestic political vulnerability, 

alongside widespread allegations that the PA has been corrupt and repressive under his leadership. 

Groups willing to use violence, including Hamas and PIJ and some from Abbas ’s own Fatah 

movement, have sought to portray themselves as more authentic reflections of Palestinian 

nationalism. 64 When Israeli -Palestinian tensions spike, these groups often publicly encourage the 

use of violence as a me ans of reinforcing their popularity. 

In 2007, two years after Israel ’s military withdrew from Gaza, Hamas forcibly displaced the PA 

as the de facto authority there. Hamas has controlled the territory since then, subject to Israeli and 

Egyptian access restr ictions and occasional conflicts in which Hamas and other militants have 

fired rockets from Gaza while Israel has carried out airstrikes and other military operations in and 

around Gaza (see text box below).

Gaza and Its Challenges 

The Gaza  Strip —controlled by Hamas, but significantly affected by general Israeli and Egyptian access and 

import/export restrictions —faces difficult and complicated political, economic, and humanitarian conditions. 65 

Palestinian militants in Gaza  clash  at times  with  Israel’s military as it patrols Gaza’s frontiers with Israel, with 

militant actions and Israeli responses sometimes endangering civilians in both places. These incidents  occasionally 

escalate toward larger conflict, as in May 2021. Hamas and Israel report edly work through Egypt and Qatar to 

help manage the flow of necessary resources into Gaza and prevent or manage conflict escalation. Since 2018, 

Egypt and Hamas (perhaps with implied Israeli approval) have permitted some commercial trade via the informal 

Salah al Din crossing that bypasses the formal PA controls and taxes at other Gaza crossings. 66 

With Gaza under Hamas control, the obstacles to  internationally supported  recovery from  the  May 2021 conflict 

remain largely the same as after previous Israel -Ga za  conflicts in 2008 -2009, 2012, and 2014. 67  Because of the PA’s 

inability to control security in Gaza, it has been unwilling to manage donor pledges toward reconstruction, leading 

to concerns about Hamas diverting international assistance for its own purpo ses. 68  Before the 2021 conflict, Qatar 

had provided cash assistance for Gaza, but due to Israeli concerns about the potential for its diversion, Qatar 

began an arrangement in September 2021 to provide money transfers to needy families through the United 

Nat ions. 69  In November 2021, Qatar and Egypt agreed on a new mechanism —with Israel’s tacit approval —to 

restart assistance toward Gaza civil servants’ salaries that had been on hold since the May 2021 outbreak of 

conflict. 70 

Traditionally, the PLO/PA has relied on political and financial support from Arab countries and 

other international actors while seeking Palestinian statehood via a peace agreement with Israel. 

In the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative, the League of Arab States (Arab League) agreed to certain 

refer ence points on issues of Israeli -Palestinian dispute in an effort to elicit Israeli diplomatic 

compromise. 71 Over the past decade, however, many Arab governments have become 

preoccupied with domestic survival and regional threats from Iran and non -state act ors, and also 

have begun adjusting to a changing global order with a less dominant U.S. role in the Middle 

East. Thus, through the Abraham Accords and other developments, some Arab leaders have 

sought closer relations with Israel —due to its strong and tech nologically advanced military and 

economy —despite Palestinians ’ unresolved national demands. Some Arab states also have 

significantly reduced financial support for the PA. 72 

Israel has taken some steps to improve Palestinians ’ economic and living circumstances, 

including through loans and work permits. 73 However, some critics charge that the measures

mirror past Israeli efforts to manage the conflict ’s effects unilaterally rather than address its 

causes through negotiation with Palestinians. 74 

In th is context, PLO/PA leaders have supported diplomatic efforts and actions within international 

organizations aimed at applying pressure on Israel to return to negotiations or end controversial 

practices associated with its control over Palestinians. PA Pres ident Abbas (who also chairs the 

PLO) and other leading Palestinian figures have warned that time may run out for Israeli -

Palestinian negotiations, threatening to pursue more robust international political, economic, and 

legal means to advance Palestinian human rights and self -determination claims. 75 Egypt and 

Jordan, which made peace with Israel in previous decades and are direct neighbors of Israel and 

the Palestinians, continue to express interest in facilitating Israeli -Palestinian peace. 

# The Biden Admin istration: Diplomacy and Human Rights 

# Considerations 

Biden Administration officials have said that they seek to preserve the viability of a negotiated 

two -state solution to the Israeli -Palestinian conflict, while playing down near -term prospects for 

direct Israeli -Palestinian negotiations. 76 In doing so, they seek to help manage tensions, bolster 

Israel ’s defensive capabilities, and strengthen U.S. -Palestinian ties that frayed during the Trump 

Administration. As mentioned above, t hese officials regularly spe ak out against steps taken by 

Israelis or Palestinians that could risk sparking violence and undermining the vision of two 

states —including settlement expansion and settler violence, demolitions, evictions, incitement to 

violence, and payments for individu als imprisoned for acts of terrorism. 77 

Some international bodies have subjected alleged Israeli human rights violations against 

Palestinians to further legal and political scrutiny. In March 2021, the International Criminal 

Court (ICC) prosecutor began an investigation into possible crimes in the West Bank and Gaza. 78 

The investigation might draw from the findings of an ongoing commission of inquiry established 

by the U.N. Human Rights Council in May 2021 after a major Israel -Gaza conflict. 79 The Biden 

Admini stration responded skeptically to the creation of the “open -ended ” commission of 

inquiry. 80 Like its predecessors, the Administration has criticized the Human Rights Council for

letter urging Secretary of State Antony Blinken to lead a multinational effort to end the 

commission. 82 That same month, the U.N. Special Rapporteur for the “situation of human rights 

in the Palestinian territory occupied since 1967 ” repo rted to the Council that Israel is practicing 

“apartheid ” in that territory. 83 Proposed l egislation to reduce U.S. contributions to the U.N. 

budget, based on a portion of the amount budgeted for the commission of inquiry, has been 

introduced in the Senate a nd House ( S. 4389 and H.R. 7223 ). 

Members of Congress have taken var ying positions on human rights -related co ncerns. S ome 

Members have increased their scrutiny over Israel ’s use of U.S. security assistance, contributing 

to debate on the subject. 84 Some other Member s have stated their opposition 85 to a State 

Department proposal to fund one or two organizations to “strengthen accountability and human 

rights in I srael and the West B ank and Gaza. ”86 

Violence and Controversy in 2022 

Since March 2022,  a wave of Israeli -Palestinian violence  has resulted to date in  the deaths of  19 Israelis or 

foreigners  in Israel  and more  than 40  Palestinians, 87  amid the following :

 Protests and violent altercations around Jerusalem holy  sites, including during  religious holidays  and other 

sensitive times commemorating historical events  (see “ Tensions ”).

 Heightened Israeli and PA security measures to counter alleged Palestinian lawlessness and militancy in West 

Bank cities such as Jenin. 88 

In May 2022,  prominent  Al Jazeera  journalist Shiree n Abu Akleh (a Palestinian Christian from East Jerusalem who 

was a U.S. citizen ) was kill ed by a gunshot in  an  area  of Jenin  where Israeli security forces were trading fire with 

Palestinian s. Her death triggered  a major international outcry , as did images  of Israeli police disrupting her funeral 

in East Jerusalem . In condemning Abu Akleh’s killing and an injury suffered by one of her colleagues, t he State 

Department  spokesperson  called for a n immediate and  thorough investigation  and full accountability , and  said that 

Israel has “ the wherewithal and the capabilities to conduct a thorough, comprehensive investigation. ”89  Some 

evidence  suggests  that the shot may have come from Israeli forces ,90  with the PA  claiming that its investigation 

proves Israeli forces deliberately targeted Abu Akleh , but Israel denying  any such intent .91  It is  unclear  whether

# Settlements 

Overview 

Israel has approximately 132 official residential communities in the West Bank (known 

internationally and by significant segments of Israeli society as “settlements ”) , and approximately 

141 additional settlement outposts unauthorized under Israeli law .95 It also maintains other 

military and civilian land -use sites in the West Bank. Taken together, Israel ’s footpri nt in these 

areas significantly constrains Palestinian claims, movement, and access in the West Bank. In 

addition, Israeli authorities and Jewish Israeli citizens have established roughly 14 main 

residential areas (referred to variously as “settlements ” or “neighborhoods ”) in East Jerusalem. 96 

All of these residential communities are located beyond the 1949 -1967 Israel -Jordan armistice 

line (the “Green Line ”) in areas that Palestinians assert are rightfully part of their envisioned 

future state.

combination of legal, historical, strategic, nationalistic, or religious justifications. 97

Most countries consider these settlements to be illegal transfers of civilian populations to 

occupied territory, though U.S. stances on this issue since 1967 have varied (see “U.S. Policy ”) .98 

U.N. Security C ouncil Resolution 2334, adopted in December 2016 with the United States as the 

lone abstention , stated that settlements established by Israel in “Palestinian territory occupied 

since 1967, including East Jerusalem, ” constitute “a flagrant violation under i nternational law ”

and a “major obstacle ” to a two -state solution and a “just, lasting and comprehensive peace. ”

Israel, in contrast, asserts that the West Bank is “disputed territory ” rather than “occupied 

territory, ” and that building civilian settlements or applying Israeli law in the territory does not 

violate international law. 99

the land with Jewish historical and religious narratives.

The most -cited international law pertaining to Israeli settlements is the Fourth Geneva Convention, Part III, Section 

III, Article 49 Relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War , August 12, 1949, which states in its last 

sentence, “The Occupying Power shall not deport or transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it 

occupies. ”

of Foreign Affairs , Israeli Settlements and International Law , November 30, 2015; Britain Israel Communications and 

Research Centre, “Extending Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank,” June 2020. Israel argues that the previous 

occupying power (Jordan) did not have an internationally recognized claim to the West Bank (only a few countries 

recognized Jordan’s 1950 annexation of the territory) , and that in view of the demise of the Ottoman Empire at the end 

of World War I and the end of the British Mandate in 1948, no international actor has superior legal claim to Israel’s.

Israel has largely completed a separation barrier that roughly tracks the Green Line, but departs 

from it in a number of areas that include significant settlement populations (s ee  Figure 3).100 Not 

counting East Jerusalem, one source states that 77% of Israeli settlers live within the barrier ’s

perimeter. 101 Counting East Jerusalem, the figure grows to 8 4%. 102 

Israeli officials state that the barrier ’s purpose is to separate Israelis and Palestinians and prevent 

terrorists from entering Israel. Palestinians object to places where the barrier runs beyond the 

Green L ine because it cuts Palestinians off from East Jerusalem and, in some pl aces, bisects their 

landholdings and communities. Many Palestinians decry it as an Israeli device to integrate 

occupied territory into Israel proper .103

Note: Under the Oslo agreements, the West Bank (not including East Jerusalem) is subject to a tiered system of 

shared control between Israel’s military and the PA in Areas A, B, and C, subject to overarching Israeli security 

prerogatives. Areas A and B are under PA administration, while Area C is under Israeli administration.

In a July 2004 International Court of Justice advisory opinion, the barrier’s construction was deemed illegal. The

Impli cations 

Settlers affect the political and diplomatic calculus in various ways. They i nfluence key voting 

blocs in Israel ’s coalition -based parliamentary system . Additionally, some initiate public protest 

and even violent resistance against government effor ts to limit or regulate their actions. Also, they 

claim a significant symbolic role in a country where there is substantial support for historical 

narratives of national survival based on self -sufficiency and pioneering spirit in the face of 

adversity. 

As Israel has expanded settlements in the West Bank since 1967, it has integrated many of those 

settlements and their residents into the political and economic life of Israel proper. As reflected in 

these settlements ’ highly functional infrastructure, local self -governing councils, and 

transportation and communications links with Israel, there is little to distinguish some of them 

from towns in Israel proper other than the military ’s formal responsibility for their administration. 

Additionally, some norms of Israeli law already apply to West Bank settlements, “either through 

application of personal jurisdiction over the settlers, or through military decrees that incorporated 

Israeli law into the law applicable to all or parts of the West Bank .” 104 Since 2016, va rious 

Knesset members have reportedly proposed bills that would apply Israeli law, jurisdiction, 

administration, and formal sovereignty in specified West Bank areas. 105 Some observers have 

characterized the means used or proposed for integrating settlements with Israel proper, along 

with restrictions on Palestinian building and land use in surrounding areas, as “creeping 

annexation ” or “de facto annexation .”106 

Some Israelis caution that the demand to provide security to settlers, along with other services 

and transportation links to Israel , could perpetuate Israeli military control in the West Bank even 

if other rationales for maintaining such control eventually recede. The protection of settlers is 

complicated by altercations between some settlers and Palestinian West Bank residents , and some 

settlers ’ defiance of Israeli military authorities. An early 2022 report cited increases in West Bank 

violence between settlers and Palestinians, and settler harassment of Palestinian communities. 107 

When ordered by Israel ’s court system to dismantle unauthorized outposts, the government has 

complied. In some cases, the government has placate d settlers by relocating displaced outpost 

residents within the boundaries of settlements permitted under Israeli law. 108 In 2020, Israel ’s

Supreme Court invalidated a 2017 law that had sought to retroactively legalize about 4,000 

homes built on privately owned Palestinian land. 109

U.S. Policy 

U.S. policy on settlements has varied since 1967. Until the 1980s, multiple Administrations e ither 

stated or implied that settlements were contrary to international law .110 President Reagan later 

stated that settlements were “not illegal, ” but “ill -advised ” and “unnecessarily provocative. ”111 

Since then, a common U.S. stance has been that settleme nts are an “obstacle to peace. ”

Additionally, loan guarantees to Israel currently authorized by U.S. law are subject to possible 

reduction by an amount equal to the amount Isr ael spends on settlements .112 

A former U.S. official wrote in 2014 that U.S. Administra tions are “not entirely sure what to do 

with the fact that Israeli prime ministers of all political stripes have continued Israeli settlement 

building on the West Bank and construction in parts of east Jerusalem that we ’d like to see 

become the capital of a Palestinian state. ”113 An April 2004 letter from President George W. Bush 

to then Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon explicitly acknowledged that “in light of new realities 

on the ground, including already exis ting major Israeli populations [sic] centers, it is unrealistic to 

expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the 

armistice lines of 1949.” 114 President Obama signed trade and customs legislation ( P.L. 114 -26 

and P.L. 114 -125 ) opposing punitive economic measures against Israel (such as measures 

advocated by a non -governmental boycott , divestment, and sanctions [BDS] movement). 

However, he asserted in a presidential signing statement for P.L. 114 -125 that certain provisions 

treating “Israeli -controlled territories ” (i.e., West Bank settlements) beyond the Green Line in the 

same manner as Israel itself were not in line with U.S. policy. 115 

The Trump Administration said that the expansion of settlements beyond their current borders 

may not be helpful to pea ce ,116 but later reversed a 1978 State Department legal advisory letter 

that had characterized settlements as “inconsistent with international law. ”117 The Administration 

took additional steps in 2020 that could be interpreted as legitimizing Israeli settlemen ts in the 

West Bank, including changing product labeling guidance to have products from settlement areas 

labeled “Made in Israel ,”118 and removing geographic restrictions that had previously prevented 

three U.S. -Israel binational research foundations from op erating be yon d the Green Line. 119 The 

Administration also proposed a peace plan in 2020 that anticipated incorporating settlements into 

Israel, pending further Israeli -Palestinian negotiation. 120

The Biden Administration has not taken specific action regarding the Trump Administration 

policies mentioned above, but has regularly criticized settlement expansion as a unilateral activity 

that could undermine prospects for a two -state solution .121 Some Israeli settlement construction 

plans for East Jerusalem and the West Bank have advanced, 122 but in 2021 Israel reportedly 

delayed the process for plans in the controversial “E-1” area (see  Figure 4) and anothe r

settlement flagged as particularly damaging to the two -state vision by the Biden Administration 

or some Members of Congress. 123 In May 2022, Israel advanced plans for nearly 4,500 additional 

housing units for West Bank settlements, 124 drawing statements of s trong opposition from the 

Administration. 125 Israel had reportedly advanced fewer units than originally planned in response 

to U.S. and domestic political concerns, 126 while Foreign Minister Lapid insisted that Israel d id 

not need U.S. permission to build. 127 Israel may seek to advance plans for E -1 later in 2022. 128 

# Jerusalem 

Israel officially considers Jerusalem to be its capital (see  Figure 4 below) ,129 incl uding 

 The western part of Jerusalem that Israel has controlled since 1948, which has 

served as the official seat of Israel ’s government since shortly after its founding 

as a state. 

 The eastern part that Israel unilaterally incorporated into itself after se izing the 

West Bank in the 1967 Arab -Israeli war . In doing so, Israel, e xpand ed the city ’s

municipal boundaries to encompass some neighborhoods and villages not part of 

the city during Jordan ’s 1948 -1967 rule. 

U.N. Security Council Resolution 478 (1980) affirmed that a Knesset law effectively annexing 

East Jerusalem violated international law .130 Largely because the U.N. General Assembly 

conferred a special international status on Jerusalem in the partition plan it adopted in 1947 

(Resolution 181(II)), most countries do not recognize Israeli sovereignty over any part of the city 

and have their embassies to Israel located elsewhere. 131

Departing from the decades -long practice of the United States and other countries, the Trump 

Administration recognized Jerusale m as Israel ’s capital in 2017 and moved the location of the 

U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in 2018 (see  Figure 5). Palestinian leade rs 

condemned these actions . The President pointed to t he Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 ( P.L. 104 -

45 ) as a significant factor in the policy change. 132 The Palestinian s claim East Jerusalem as their 

future national capital —though the Trump Administration did not take a position on the 

boundaries of Israeli sovereignty in the city. The Biden Administration has said that the embassy 

will remain in Jerusalem. 133 Following the U.S. embassy move in 2018, a few other countries 

have opened embassies (Guatemala and Honduras) or embassy branch offices (Hungary and 

Czech Republic) in Jerusalem. 

East Jerusalem Controversies 

Various controversies surrounding Israel ’s administration of Jerusa lem stem from its being under 

Israeli domestic jurisdiction, while (as mentioned above) most countries view the entire city ’s

status as still subject to negotiation and consider East Jeru salem to be occupied territory ( based on 

its capture from Jordan in t he 1967 war ).134 Israel ’s national government and the municipal 

government for Jerusalem apply Israeli law in the city. Most Arabs in East Jerusal em have 

permanent resident status in Israel, but identify as Palestinians and are not Israeli citizens, 135 and 

do not participate in Jerusalem municipality elections. 136 They can lose their residency status if 

Israeli authorities determine that East Jerusalem is no longer their primary residence. 137 

Within th e context of competing national and religious narratives regardi ng Jerusalem. Israelis 

have routinely used their influence with municipal and national authorities to advance Jewish 

objectives in the city, while Palestinians with marginal direct influence over Jerusale m’s formal 

administration have engaged in protests and occasional ly violence , attract ing international 

attention .138 For 2021, t he State D epartment reported that “the Jerusalem municipality and other 

authorities failed to provide sufficient social services, education, infrastructure, and emergency 

planning for Palestinian neighborhoods, especially in the areas between the [separation] barrier 

and the municipal boundary. Approximately 117,000 Palestinians lived in that area, of whom 

approximately 61,000 were registered as Jerusalem residents, accordi ng to government data. ”139

Ongoing East Jerusalem controversies that have attracted U.S. and international attention include 

 Threats to Palestinian contiguity. Israeli plans to build or expand Jewish 

neighborhoods could significantly affect geographical cont iguity between 

Palestinian neighborhoods in East Jerusalem and the West Bank. 140 

 Evictions and demolitions. The status of some Palestinian residents in the Old 

City and other neighborhoods (such as Sheikh Jarrah, Silwan, and Walaja) is 

precarious . Israeli e victions and demolitions (or ongoing threats of such action) 

affecting these people fuel protests and legal action ,141 and t he Biden 

Administration has criticized these actions —sometimes with regard to specific 

cases .142 The State Department has highlighted the non -reciprocal nature of 

Israeli law as applied to East Jerusalem property disputes. The law authorizes 

Israeli suits to reacquire East Jerusalem land based on pre -194 8 ownership 

claims, and generally prohibits Palestinian suits to reacquir e land on the other 

side of the Green Line based on similar pre -194 8 ownership claims .143 

 Treatment of non -Jewish communities . According to the State Department, the 

PA and some civil society groups claim that the Israeli government and settler 

organization s encourage greater Jewish property ownership in East Jerusalem at 

least partly to emphasize Jewish history in Palestinian neighborhoods .144 Whether 

the Israel Antiquities Authority gives proper attention to researching non -Jewish 

periods in the archaeologic al record has been a subject of debate .145 Two private 

organizations working toward greater Jewish control and settlement in 

Jerusalem ’s historical basin are Ateret Cohanim (“ Crown of the Priests ”) and the 

Ir David (“ City of David ”) Foundation, also known as Elad. 146 In 2020, the 

leaders of 13 Christian denominations in Jerusalem protested that a controversial 

legal ruling transferring some Old City property from the Greek Orthodox 

Patriarchate to Ateret Cohanim represented a systematic attempt “to weaken the 

Christian presence in Jerusalem. ”147

The “Status Quo ”: Jews and Muslims at the Temple Mount/Haram al Sharif 

Background 

The status of Jerusalem and its holy sites has been a long -standing issue of political and religious 

contention between Jews and Muslims. A number of violent episodes occurred in Jerusalem 

during the 1920s and 1930s, and control over the city and key areas in and around it was a major 

strategic consideration in the Arab -Israeli wa rs of 1948 and 1967. 

Notwithstanding Israel ’s 1967 takeover and subsequent annexation of East Jerusalem, it allowed 

the Jordanian waqf (or Islamic custodial trust) that had been administering the Temple 

Mount/Haram al Sharif (the “Mount/Haram ”) and its holy sites before the war to continue doing 

so, and established a “status quo ” arrangement that has been Israel ’s proclaimed policy since 

then .148 The Mount/Haram contains some of the most important sites for Abrahamic religions : the 

foundation of the first and second Jewish temples , the Dome of the Rock, and Al Aqsa Mosque 

(see  Figure 6). 149  

> 148

The status of Jordan’s Hashemite king —who traces his descent to the Prophet Muhammad —as custodian of Muslim 

holy sites in Jerusalem can be traced to (1) a 1924 decision by Arab authorities in Jerusalem during the British Mandate 

for Palestine (the Grand M ufti and Supreme Muslim Council) to accept the Hashemite dynasty as custodian of the sites 

after the formal end of the Ottoman sultan’s claim to the Islamic Caliphate, and (2) Jordan’s control over East 

Jerusalem from 1948 to 1967. It was codified in Jorda n’s 1994 peace treaty with Israel, and reinforced in a 2013 

agreement with the PA. Many Christian leaders in Jerusalem also recognize the king to be custodian over Christian 

holy sites.

Figure  6. Old City of Jerusalem 

Under the Israeli status quo policy, Muslims can access the Mount/Haram and worship there, 

while Jews and other n on -Muslims are permitted access but not allow ed to worship. The policy is 

largely based on past practices dating from the 19 th century (while t he Ottoman Empire ruled 

Jerusalem) until the 1948 war. 150 Jewish worship is permitted at the Western Wall at the base of 

the Mount/Haram. The waqf and many other Muslims have a different understanding of the status 

quo, insisting that only Muslim worshippers should have unrestricted access to the Mount/Haram  

> 150

The application of the term “status quo” to Jerusalem’s holy sites dates back to an 1852 Ottoman Empire ruling 

about the rights of different Christian churches to worship at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and other Christian 

sites. The Muslim sites on the Mount/Haram (most notably Al Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock) were 

eventually informally incorporated into the status quo arrangement. After the fall of the Ottoman Empire, the League of 

Nations Palestine Mandate of 192 2 gave legal recognition to the status quo. Marlen Eordegian, “British and Israeli 

Maintenance of the Status Quo in the Holy Places of Christendom,” International Journal of Middle East Studies , Vol. 

35, No. 2, May 2003. Israel: Background and U.S. Relations  

> Congressional Research Service 30

and rejecting any limits on the waqf ’s authority there. 151 Israeli police manage entry for non -

Muslims to the Mount/Haram through one gate, while the waqf manages several other gates 

permitting entry for Muslims under police supervision. Aside from providing guidance on who 

can enter and worship at the Mount/Hara m and how to conduct security, status quo arrangements 

also address other matters like construction and archaeological preservation and excavation. 152 

In times of tension around the holy sites, U.S. officials routinely call on all parties to maintain the 

st atus quo. 153 The status quo is criticized and cha llenged by some rabbis and other individuals or 

groups who assert that Israel should advance Jewish historical and religious claims to the 

Mount/Haram, despite rulings from government -appointed rabbis proscrib ing Jewish visits 

there. 154 Past events fueling concerns among Palestinians about possible Israeli attempts to 

chan ge the status quo have included 

 September 1996 clashes leading to the deaths of 54 Palestinians and 14 Israeli 

security personnel after Israel opened a passage leading to/from the Western Wall 

esplanade through a tunnel (known as the Hasmonean or Kotel Tunnel) that 

arch aeologists had uncovered and restored. 155 

 A September 2 000 Mount/Haram visit by Likud p arty leader (and future prime 

minister) Ari el Sharon just prior to the outbreak of the second Palestinian 

intifada. Shortly after the intifada began, Israel and the Jordanian waqf agreed to 

close the Mount/Haram completely to non -Muslims. 156 

 Israel ’s August 2003 reopening of the Mount/Haram to non -Mu slims despite the 

waqf ’s objections. Since then, the waqf has restricted non -Muslims from entering 

the Dome of the Rock and Al Aqsa Mosque, marking a change from close daily 

Israel -waqf coordination regarding the status quo to minimal, irregular 

coordinati on. 157 

 Various developments from 2014 -2017, including temporary Israeli restrictions 

on Mount/Haram access for some Muslims during a wave of Israeli -Palestinian 

violence, U.S. -brokered Israel -Jordan negotiations about security cameras on the 

Mount/Haram (whi ch were not ultimately installed), and abortive efforts by Israel 

to install metal detectors at Muslim access points. 158 

Over the past two decades, Jewish Israelis have increasingly sought to visit the Mount/Haram, 

with over 33,000 visits reported in 2021, triggering debate about the possible erosion of the status 

quo. Millions of Muslims visit the site annually. 159 Because Israeli practices call for police to

escort visiting Jewish groups, the increase in visits has led to more frequent police measures 

limiti ng access for some groups of Muslims and Jews during religious holidays and other 

sensitive times. While Israeli authorities insist that they do not permit Jewish worship, some 

sources have provided evidence suggesting that at least sometimes the police do not prevent 

Jewish visitors from praying. 160 In April 2022, Israeli Diaspora Affairs Minister Nachman Shai 

admitted that some Jews ’ prayer on the Mount/Haram has led to “a certain deterioration of the 

status quo. ”161 

Some Muslims allege that Israel seeks cha nges to the Mount/Haram that will eventually displace 

Muslim worship and access, while Israeli officials generally reject this characterization and say 

they remain committed to the status quo and countering both Jewish and Muslim extremists. 162 

They criticiz e Hamas and other Islamist groups for allegedly inciting unrest and efforts to disrupt 

Jewish visits to the Mount/Haram. 163 

Tensions in 2021 and 2022 

Unrest at the Mount/Haram during Ramadan in May 2021, combined with disputes about the 

possible eviction of several Palestinian families in East Jerusalem, contributed to an environment 

vulnerable to the broadening of conflict. After Hamas claimed it was defending Jerusalem by 

firing rockets toward the city from Gaza, its ultimatum for Israeli troops to leave t he 

Mount/Haram factored into the start of a major 11 -day Israel -Gaza conflict. 

During an overlap between the Ramadan and Passover holidays in April 2022, Israeli police and 

Muslims clashed over tensions regarding the status quo —including a few instances in which the 

police entered Al Aqsa Mosque. 164 A committee of Arab foreign ministers meeting in Jordan 

rejected “all i llegal Israeli practices aimed at changing the legal and historical status quo .” 165 In 

calls with Israeli Prime Minister Bennett an d Jordanian King Abdullah II, President Biden took 

note of efforts to reduce tensions. 166 The White House reported that d uring the call with King 

Abdullah, President Biden “underscored the need to preserve the historic status quo at the Haram 

al -Sharif/Templ e Mount, and recognized the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan ’s role as the 

custodian of Muslim holy places in Jerusalem .” 

In May 2022, the Jerusalem Magis trate ’s Court ruled that Israel did not have a sufficiently 

compelling reason to prevent three Jewish teena gers from praying at the Mount/Haram, triggering 

concern about deterioration of the status quo from Jordanian and PA officials. 167 The Israeli prime 

minister ’s office released a statement saying it would not change the status quo and that the

court ’s ruling only applied to the specifics of the one case. 168 Later in May, the Jerusalem District 

Court overturned the Magistrate ’s Court ruling upon the government ’s appeal, ruling that 

freedom of worship on the Temple Mount “is not absolute, and should be superseded by other 

interests, among them the safeguarding of public order .” 169 

Reopening of U.S. Consulate in Jerusalem? 

Biden Administration officials have said that they plan to reopen the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem 

that had previously functioned as an independent diplomatic mission in handling relations with 

the Palestinians, without specifying when the consulate might reopen. 170 The Trump 

Administration merged the consulate into the U.S. Embassy in Israel in March 2019, with the 

consulate ’s functions taken over by a Palestinian Affairs Unit (PAU) within the embassy. 

Competing Israeli and Palestinian national narratives influence this issue, with both sides 

appealing to U.S. officials about the importance of Jerusalem and its holy sites to their domestic 

constituencie s.171 

Reestablishing the consulate would require Israeli cooperation, given the need for Israeli 

authorities to issue visas to and help protect U.S. diplomats. 172 In a November 3, 2021, hearing 

before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Deputy Secretary of S tate for Management and 

Resources Brian McKeon said that “the practical reality is we would need privileges and 

immunities, which only the state of Israel can provide. ”173 Several top Israeli officials, including 

Prime Minister Bennett and Foreign Minister L apid, have voiced strong opposition to a proposed 

reopening in Jerusalem. 174 During a visit to the White House in August 2021, Bennett reportedly 

sought to convince President Biden to open a consulate somewhere in the West Bank near (but 

not within) Jerusale m, such as Ramallah or the town of Abu Dis. 175 In late 2021, Members of 

Congress introduced bills in both h ouses (S. 3063 and H.R. 6004 ) that would oppose reopening a 

consulate in Jerusalem to handle relations with the Palestinians, and prohibit funding for any 

diplomatic facility in Jerusalem other than the U.S. Embassy in Israel. 

A December 2021 media report claimed that controversy on the issue led the Biden 

Administration to effectively shelve plan s to reopen the consulate. It also said that the PAU was 

co mmunicating directly with State Department offici als in Washington, rather than working 

through other embassy channels. 176 In June 2022, the PAU was re -branded as the Office of 

Palestinian Affairs (OPA) , with the OPA operating under the auspices of the embassy while 

reporting directly to Washington .177 This type of direct communication was a core aspect of the

continues to press for the reopening of the consulate. 178 

# Regional Threats and Relationships 

# Countering Iran 

Is raeli officials cite Iran as one of their primary concerns, largely because of (1) antipathy toward 

Israel expressed by Iran ’s revolutionary regime, (2) Iran ’s broad regional influence ( including in 

Syria, Iraq, Lebanon , and Yemen ), and (3) Iran ’s nuclear and missile programs and advanced 

conventional weapons capabilities. Iran -backed groups ’ demonstrated abilities since 2019 to 

penetrate the air defenses of countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates through 

coordinated drone and missile attacks ha ve implications for Israeli security calculation s.179 Israeli 

observers who anticipate the possibility of a future war similar or greater in magnitude to Israel ’s

2006 war against Lebanese Hezbollah refer to t he small -scale military skirmishes or covert 

actions since then involving Israel, Iran, or their allies as “the campaign between the wars. ”180 

Iranian Nuclear Issue and Regional Tensions 

Israel has sought to influence U.S. decisions on the international agr eement on Iran ’s nuclear 

program (known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA). Then -Prime Minister 

Netanyahu strenuously opposed the JCPOA in 2015 when it was negotiated by the Obama 

Administration, and welcomed President Trump ’s May 2018 wi thdrawal of the United States 

from the JCPOA and accompanying reimposition of U.S. sanctions on Iran ’s core economic 

sectors. Since this time , Iran has increased its enrichment of uranium to levels that could 

significantly shorten the time it requires to p roduce fissile material for nuclear weapons. 181 

Reported low -level Israel -Iran conflict has persisted in various settings —including cyberspace, 

international waters, and the territory of Syria, Lebanon, and Iraq —with implications for regional 

tensions .182 In J une 2022, then -Prime Minister B ennett characterized some operations inside Iran 

in the past year as targeting the “head of the octopus ” to counter a range of Iranian military 

capabilities. 183 

As the Biden Administration engag es in international diplomacy and consider s the possibility of 

reentering or revising the JCPOA, Israel is reportedly still seeking to influence diplomatic 

outcomes . Prior to the November 2021 resumption of international negotiations with Iran, then -

Prime Minister Bennett stated that Isra el would not be bound by a return to the JCPOA. 184 A

January 2022 report suggest ed that some leading Israeli security off icials might prefer an 

international deal to no deal because an agreement could provide “increased certainty about the 

limitations on Ira n’s nuclear program, and it would buy more time for Israel to prepare for 

escalation scenarios. ”185 During his time as prime minister, Bennett opposed the deal, 186 but 

largely abstained from involvement in U.S. debates on the issue .187 

As international discussi ons around the JCPOA continued in March 2022, Bennett and Lapid 

issued a joint statement arguing against reports that the United States might remove Iran ’s Islamic 

Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) from its Foreign Terrorist Organizations list in exchange f or 

a promise not to harm Americans. 188 In an April 26 , 2022, Senate Foreign Relations Committee 

hearing, Secretary Blinken said that he could only envision the IRGC ’s de -listing if Iran takes 

steps necessary to justify it. 189 On May 4, 62 Senators voted in fav or of a motion that any Iran 

nuclear deal must address Iran ’s ballistic missile program, support for terrorism, and oil trade 

with China , and not lift sanctions on or de -list the IRGC. 190 Later in May, Bennett claim ed that 

President Biden told him in April that he would not de -list the IRGC. 191 

Various sources document reported I sraeli covert or military operations targeting Iran ’s nuclear 

program, 192 and some U.S. officials have reportedly differed with Israeli counterparts on the 

overall effectiveness of such operations. 193 In between his August 2021 White House meetings 

with then -Prime Minister Bennett, President Biden said that the United States will first use 

diplomacy to “ensure Iran never develops a nuclear weapon, ” but if that fails, “we ’re ready to 

turn to other options. ”194 In a September 2021 interview, Defense Minister Gantz suggested that 

he would be prepared to accept a U.S. return to the JCPOA, while also calling for a “viable, U.S. -

led plan B ” to pressure Iran in case negotiations are unsuccessful, and alluding to Israeli military 

contingency plans. 195 

As of May 2022, one source reported that divisions persist among I sraeli officials over which 

approach or combination of approaches —among options including international diplomacy, U.S. -

led sanctions, and Israeli military and intelligence operations —may be likelier to prevent or slow 

Iranian nuclear advances .196 Some sources allude to upgrades in Israeli military capabilities, 197 but

questions apparently remain about military readiness for a major operation aga inst Iran ’s nuclear 

program. 198 

Syria 

In the early years of the Syria conflict , Israel primarily employed airstrikes to prevent Iranian 

weapons shipments destined for Hezbollah in Lebanon. Later, as the government of Bashar al 

Asad reacquired control of large portions of Syria ’s territory , Israeli leaders expressed intentions 

to prevent Iran from constructing and operating bases or advanced weapons manufacturing 

facilities in Syria . According to a March 2022 report, since 2017 Israel ’s air force has struc k at 

least 1,200 targets in Syria using around 5,500 munitions .199 In 2021, the deployment of some 

Iranian air defense systems in Syria prompted Israel to start sending larger aircraft formations to 

reduce the chances of having an aircraft downed. 200 In 2021, Iran -backed forces attacked the 

small U.S. military base at Al Tanf in southern Syria, ostensibly in response to Israeli airstrikes. 201 

The base is in a position to block supply lines to Hezbollah in Lebanon and otherwise disrupt 

Iran ’s regional operations. 202 

After several years of conflict in Syria, in 2019 the United States recognized Israeli sovereignty 

over the Golan Heights, a territory Israel captured from Syria during the 1967 Arab -Israeli war. 

For more information, see  Appendix C .

Russia ’s advanced air defense systems in Syria could affect Israeli operations there .203 Russia has 

reportedly shown some capacity to thwart Israeli airstrikes against Iranian or Syrian targets ,204 but 

has generally refrained via a deconfliction mechanism with Israel .205 This deconfliction has 

apparently continued to date even with Russia ’s war in Ukraine, but Russia has criticized some 

Israeli strikes .206 In May 2022, a Russi an -origin S -300 air defense system in Syria reportedly fired 

on Israeli jets for the first time, raising questions about the status of Israel -Russia deconfliction. 207 

Hezbollah in Lebanon 

Lebanese Hezbollah is Iran ’s closest and most powerful nonstate ally i n the region. Hezbollah ’s

forces and Israel ’s military have sporadically clashed near the Lebanese border for decades —with 

the antagonism at times contained in the border area, and at times escalating into broader

conflict. 208 Speculation persists about the potential for wider conflict and its implications, 

including from incursions into Israeli airspace by Hezbollah drones .209 

Israeli officials have sought to draw attention to Hezbollah ’s buildup of mostly Iran -supplied 

weapons —including reported upgrades to t he range, precision , and power of its projectiles —and 

its alleged use of Lebanese civilian areas as strongholds. 210 In early 2022, Hezbollah ’s leadership 

and Israel ’s defense ministry both publicly cited Iran -backed efforts by Hezbollah to manufacture 

precis ion -guided missiles in Lebanon. 211 

Palestinian Militants and Gaza 

Israel faces a n ongoing threat from the Gaza Strip , mainly from the militant groups Hamas and 

PIJ, which both receive assistance from Iran .212 Although Palestinian militants maintain rocket 

and mortar arsenals, Israel ’s Iron Dome defense system has diminished the threats they pose .213 

Systematic Israeli efforts, with some financial and technological assistance from the United 

States, have largely neutralized t unnels that Palestinian militants used somewhat effectively in a 

2014 conflict with Israel .214 Additionally, in December 2021 Israel completed an above - and 

below -ground barrier running the length of its boundary with Gaza to complement a border fence 

that Egypt built along its border with Gaza in 2020 .215 

# Arab S tates 

The Abraham Accords 

In late 2020 and early 2021, Israel reached agreements to normalize or improve its relations with 

four members of the Arab League: the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Sudan. The Trump 

Administration facilitated each of these agreements, known as the Abraham Accords, and (as 

mentioned above) provided U.S. security, diplomatic, or economic incentives for most of the 

countries in question .216 In connection with the agreements, the UAE and Sudan formally ended

These incentives included possible U.S. arms sales to the UAE and Morocco, possible U.S. and interna tional 

economic assistance or investment financing for Morocco and Sudan, and U.S. recognition of Morocco’s claim of 

sovereignty over the disputed territory of Western Sahara. Some reports suggest that the Trump Administration linked

their participat ion in the decades -long Arab League boycott of Israel. 217 Morocco and Bahrain had 

previously done so. In 2021, Israel opened embassies in the UAE and Bahrain, and both countries 

reciprocated. Israel and Morocco also reopened the liaison offices that each cou ntry had operated 

in the other from the mid -1990s to 2000. Saudi Arabia reportedly supported the UAE and Bahrain 

in their decisions to join the Abraham Accords, even allowing the use of Saudi airspace for direct 

commercial airline flights between those cou ntries and Israel. 218 

Trade , tourism, and investment ties have generally deepened since the signing of the Accords —

including a May 2022 Israel -UAE free -trade agreement (pending Israeli ratification) and a major 

Israel -UAE -Jordan initiative focused on desalinated water and solar energy .219 One exception is 

that implementing Israel -Sudan normalization appears to be on hold following the Sudanese 

military ’s seizure of power in October 2021. 220 As a sign of mutual high -level commitment to the 

Accords, Secretar y of State Blinken met Israeli Foreign Minister Lapid and the foreign ministers 

of the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Egypt at a March 2022 summit in Israel ’s southern Negev 

desert. 

U.S. and Israeli officials seek to expand the Abraham Accords to include other Arab and Muslim -

majority countries. Commemorating the one -year anniversary of t he Israel -UAE -Bahrain 

agreements in October 2021, Secretary Blinken said that “we ’re committed to continue building 

on the efforts of the last administration to expand the circ le of countries with normalized relations 

with Israel in the years ahead. ”221 However, the Biden Administration appetite for offer ing major 

U.S. policy inducements to countries in connection with normalization efforts remains unclear .222 

The Biden Administrati on also has sought to avoid portraying Israeli normalization with Arab and 

Muslim -majority states as a substitute for efforts toward a negotiated two -state solution to the 

Israeli -Palestinian conflict. 223 Palestinian leaders denounced the initial announcemen t of UAE 

normalization with Israel as an abandonment of the Palestinian national cause, given Arab League 

states ’ previous insistence that Israel address Palestinian negotiating demands as a precondition 

for improved ties. 224

The Pathway to the Abraham Accor ds 

Before the Abraham Accords, Egypt and Jordan had been the only Arab states with formal diplomatic relations 

with Israel. 225  In 1981, Saudi Arabia’s then -Crown Prince Fahd bin Abd al Aziz Al Saud proposed a formula —later 

enshrined in the 2002 Arab Peace I nitiative —under which Israel  was expected to  make certain concessions, 

including on Palestinian statehood, before Arab states would normalize their relations with it. 226  After Israel 

started negotiating directly with the Palestinians in the 1990s, it establi shed limited diplomatic relations with 

Morocco, and informal ties with a number of other Arab states, including the UAE and Bahrain. 227  These countries 

downgraded their ties with Israel after the onset of the second Palestinian  intifada  in 2000. 

However, si nce the early 2010s discreet Israeli links with Arab states  became  closer and more public on issues 

including intelligence, security, and trade. Israel  has worked with some Arab states  to counter common 

geopolitical  concerns, such as Iran’s regional influence and military capabilities and Sunni Islamist populist 

movements (including various Muslim Brotherhood branches and affiliates). 228  Controversy surfaced in 2021 over 

the possible past use of spyware from the Israel -based company NSO Group by several countries throughout the 

world, reportedly including the UAE, Bahrain, Morocco, and Saudi Arabia (all four countries publicly said that 

allegations of spyware use were unfounded). 229 

To cement its normalization of relation s with the UAE, Israel agreed in August 2020 to suspend plans to annex 

part of the West Bank, with one source stating that the UAE received a commitment from  U.S. ( Trump 

Administration ) officials that they would not approve Israeli annexation until at leas t January 2024. 230  Palestinian 

leaders claimed that the UAE legitimized Israel’s annexation threats by bargaining over them, and thus acquiesced 

to a West Bank status quo that some observers label “de facto annexation.” 231  UAE officials countered that by 

signi ficantly delaying Israeli declarations of sovereignty over West Bank areas, they preserved prospects for future 

negotiations toward a Palestinian state. 232 

Other  Arab state leaders considering entering into or maintaining normalization with Israel might  gauge whether 

expected benefits would outweigh concerns about popular criticism or unrest they might face for possibly 

undermining the Palestinian cause. 233  Normalization efforts to date have not triggered significant unrest, but 

outside insight is limited i nto public opinion, its drivers, and how popular reactions are shaped by the nature of 

authoritarian Arab regimes. 

Prospects for Saudi normalization. As Israel has drawn closer to some Arab states, the 

likelihood of a future normalization between Israel a nd Saudi Arabia may be increasing. Given 

Saudi Arabia ’s importance as an economic and military power in the region, the kingdom ’s

history of firm opposition to such normalization, and its status as the custodian of Islam ’s most 

holy and foundational sites, such a development could boost any precedent that the Abraham

Accords may set for other Muslim -majority countries considering cooperation with Israel .234 In 

June 2022, Secretary Blinken said that Saudi Arabia is a “critical partner ” of the United States in 

dealing with regional challenges from extremism and Iran and in “continuing the process of 

building relationships between Israel and its neighbors both near and further away through the 

continuation, the expansion of the Abraham Accords. ”235 

While senior Sau di officials say that full Israel -Saudi normalization still remains contingent on 

progress with Palestinian issues, 236 the two countries are reportedly engaging in serious talks in 

the meantime to build business ties and coordinate on regional security matte rs. Top Israeli and 

Saudi officials say that the countries could take certain incremental steps toward eventual 

normalization irrespective of the Palestinian question. 237 Future steps could include the expansion 

of Israel ’s transit privileges through Saudi a irspace, and Saudi Arabia ’s full assumption of control 

and security responsibility for the Red Sea islands Tiran and Sanafir from Egypt. 238 One Israeli 

journalist has argued that in talks regarding the two islands, U.S. officials are essentially 

encouraging Israel to agree to a weakening of security protocols from the 1979 Israel -Egypt peace 

treaty in exchange for a future and still unclear hope of Israeli -Saudi normalization. 239 

Security cooperation. In January 2021, President Trump determined that U.S. Central Command 

(CENTCOM), which commands U.S. military forces in most countries in the Middle East, would 

add Israel to its area of responsibility, partly to encourage military interoperability as a means of 

reinforcing closer ties between Israel an d many Arab states. 240 Israel had previously been under 

the purview of U.S. European Command. CENTCOM formalized Israel ’s move in September 

2021, 241 and in October an Israeli Defense Force s liaison was stationed at CENTCOM 

headquarters. 242 Since then, Israel has joined military exercises with the United States and the 

other Abraham Accords states, as well as other CENTCOM partners such as Saudi Arabia , Oman, 

Jordan, Egypt, and Pakistan .243 

Following a string of missile and drone attacks against the UAE in early 202 2, apparently by 

Iran -allied forces in Yemen (known as the Houthis) , the UAE government has reportedly 

expressed interest in closer security cooperation with Israel .244 Earlier, both Morocco (November 

2021) and Bahrain ( Febru ary 2022) signed MOUs with Israel on security cooperation. 245 These

MOUs appear to anticipate more intelligence sharing, joi nt exercises and training, and arms sales. 

In his February 8, 2022, confirmation hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee ,

then -nominee as CENTCOM Commander (then -) Lieu tenant General Michael Kurilla testified 

that Israel and other regional countries were cooperating on integrated air and missile defense and 

in other security areas. At the March 2022 Negev summit, Israel i leaders and their Arab 

counterparts re portedly discussed a range of possible cooperative measures, such as real -time 

intelligence sharing on inbound drone and missile threats and acquisition of Israeli air defense 

systems. 246 Speculation about specific measures has continued since then ,247 and Defense Minister 

Gantz said in June 2022 that a “Middle East Air Defense Alliance ” is already working together 

with the United States. 248 

Selected congressional actions. In January 2022, some Members of the Senate and House 

formed bipartisan caucuses to prom ote the Abraham Accords. 249 In March, Congress enacted the 

Israel Relations N ormalization Act of 2022 (IRNA, Division Z of P.L. 117 -103 ). Amo ng other 

things, the IRNA require s the Secretary of State to submit an annual strategy for strengthening 

and expanding normalization agreements with Israel, and an annual report on the status of 

measures within Arab League states that legally or practically restrict or discourage normaliz ation 

efforts with Israel or domestic support for such efforts. 

In June 2022, several Members in the Senate and House introduced the Deterring Enemy Forces 

and Enabling National Defenses (DEFEND) A ct of 2022 (S. 4366 and H.R. 7987 ). The bill would 

require the Secretary of Defense to submit a strategy and feasibility study on cooperation with 

Gulf Cooperation Council states, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt for an integrated air and missile 

defense capability to counter Iran -related threats. Later in June , similar provisions were added to 

the Senate and House Armed Services Committee -approved versions of the FY2 023 National 

Defense Authorization A ct. 

Outlook. Common cause between Israel and other Abraham Accords states could intensify, 

dwindle, or fluctuate depending on global and regional political and eco nomic trends. Questions 

include 

 What types of military co operation do Arab states seek with Israel as they 

consider the benefits and drawbacks of either deterring or accommodating Iran? 

 What other political and economic factors , including the regional roles of China

 How likely are Saudi Arabia and other countries to normalize relations with 

Israel , and under what conditions? What benefits and d rawbacks might result 

from U.S. incentives for normalization? 

Arab -Israeli Regional Energy Cooperation 

Israel ’s offshore natural gas deposits have provided additional opportunities for it to build 

economic connections with its Arab neighbors . Israel ’s 15 -year export deals with Egypt and 

Jordan —using gas from its Leviathan field —took effect in 2020. 250 These deals have reinforced a 

longstanding dynamic in which Egyptian and Jordanian government -to -government cooperation 

with Israel occurs amid some degree of popular domestic opposition, due to the history of Arab -

Israeli conflict and the Palestinian issue. 

Some of the gas covered by Israel ’s export agreement with Egypt is flowing via pipeline to 

Egypt ’s two LNG liquefaction facilities. 251 Israel appears to be seriously considering new onshore 

and subsea pipelines that could increase supply to the LNG facilities. 252 These could help make 

Egypt a hub for regional exports to Europe. 253 In June 2022, Israel signed a trilateral MOU with 

Egypt and the European Union stipulating that the parties will work together to send natural gas 

to EU member states via Egyptian LNG infrastructure. 254 

# Turkey 

Israel and Turkey have shown signs of improving ties over the past year. The two countries 

maintain diplomatic relations but have not had ambassadors stationed in each other ’s country 

since 2018. Their relations have been troubled since the late 2000s, based on disagreements over 

Palestinian issu es and Turkey ’s support for Hamas, though the countries have continued to 

expand trade ties. 255 

Israeli openness to rapprochement with Turkey may stem from a confluence of factors, including 

 Potentially greater Turkish willingness to reduce its support for Hamas in hopes 

of better political and economic relations with Israel and other key U.S. partners 

in the region (Sunni Arab governments such as the U AE and Saudi Arabia) —

partly to improve Turkey ’s image in Washington. Some reports from early 2022 

hint at Turkey ’s willingness to expel Hamas members allegedly involved in 

militant operations from its territory. 256 

 Increasing Israeli focus on how relations with Turkey and other regional 

countries might help counter Iran.

 The 2021 leadership change from the Netanyahu go vernment to the Bennett -

Lapid power -sharing government. 

In March 2022, Israeli P resident Herzog visited Turkey. In May, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut 

Cavusoglu visi ted Israel (and the West Bank), and Israeli Foreign Minister Lapid visited Turkey 

in June. The two countries anticipate future bilateral meetings and steps to improve political and 

economic relations . Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other top Turkish officials have 

made public statements expressing interest in energy cooperation with Israel . However, I sraeli 

officials reportedly remain skeptical about prospects for a subsea Israel -Turkey natural gas 

pipeline. 257 While Israel has pursued greater high -level interaction with Turkey, it may be 

cautious about significant near -term improvemen ts in bilateral relations, and appears to remain 

committed to close strategic ties with Greece and the Republic of Cyprus 258 —countries with 

which Turkey has long -standing historical, ethnoreligious, territorial, and maritime boundary 

disputes. 

# China: Invest ments in Israel and U.S. Concerns 259 

U.S. officials have raised concerns with Israel over burgeoning Chinese investments in Israeli 

high -tech companies and civilian infrastructure. 260 Israel -China investment ties have grown since 

China announced its Belt and R oad Initiative in 2013, 261 with Israel as an attractive hub of 

innovation for Chinese partners, and China as a huge potential export market and source of 

investment for Israeli businesses. 262 

Closer Israel -China economic relations have led to official U.S. expressions of concern, 263 

apparently focused on the possibility that China might gather intelligence or acquire technologies 

with the potential to threaten U.S. national security in such fields as cybersecurity, artificial 

intelligence, satellite communicat ions, and robotics. Previously, China -Israel defense industry 

cooperation in the 1990s and 2000s contributed to tension in the U.S. -Israel defense relationship 

and to an apparent de facto U.S. veto over Israeli arms sales to China. 264 Partly due to U.S.

conc erns regarding China ’s involvement in Israel ’s economy, Israel created an advisory panel on 

foreign investment in Israel in late 2019. 265 However, this panel reportedly does not have the 

authority to review investments in sectors such as high -tech that accou nted for most of China ’s

investments in Israel in the previous decade. 266 According to a 2021 study by Israel ’s Institute for 

National Security S tudies 

Chinese investments, especially in the high -tech sector, did indeed show progressive 

growth both in number and scale, especially between 2014 and their peak in 2018. 

However, in 2019 and 2020 the pendulum swung again, as China slowed its penetration 

into the Israeli economy, just as it did elsewhere in the world. The reasons for this were a 

combination of chan ges in domestic Chinese priorities regarding the export of capital out 

of the country and external causes, such as the coronavirus pandemic and a less inviting 

climate for Chinese investments due to American pressure. 267 

Additionally, U.S. officials have mad e notable efforts to discourage Chinese involvement in 

specific Israeli infrastructure projects. After reported warnings from the Trump Administration, 

Israeli officials apparently blocked Chinese companies from working on Israeli communications 

infrastruc ture such as 5G. 268 U.S. concerns may have influenced Israel ’s finance ministry to reject 

a bid in 2020 from a Hong Kong -linked company to build a major desalination plant. 269 

Additionally, the U.S. Navy reportedly reconsidered its practice of periodically doc king at the 

Israeli naval base in Haifa, because a state -owned Chinese company (the Shanghai International 

Port Group) secured the contract to operate a new terminal at Haifa ’s seaport for 25 years. 270 This 

terminal opened in September 2021. 271 Biden Administr ation officials have reportedly pressed 

Israeli counterparts to regularly check heavy machinery at the port for technology that could be 

employed to spy on the nearby Israeli naval base. 272 Other state -owned Chinese companies are 

developing a new port in Ash dod (which also hosts an Israeli naval base), and taking part in 

construction for Tel Aviv ’s light rail system and road tunnels in Haifa. 273 

In early 2022, an Israeli official was cited as saying that Israel has agreed to “update Washington 

about any major d eals with Beijing, especially in infrastructure and technology ,” and “would 

reconsider any such deals at America ’s request. ”274

# Appendix A. Historical Background 

# In General 

The modern quest for a Jewish homeland gathered momentum after the publication of Theodor 

Herzl ’s The Jewish State in 1896. Herzl was inspired by the concept of nationalism that had 

become popular among various European peoples in the 19 th century, and was also motivated by 

European anti -Semitism. The following year, Herzl described his vision at the first Zionist 

Congress, which encouraged Jewish settlement in Palestine, the territory that had included the 

Biblical home of the Jews and was then part of the Ottoman Empire. 

During World War I, the British government i ssued the Balfour Declaration, supporting the 

“establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people. ” Palestine became a British 

Mandate after the war and British officials simultaneously encouraged the national aspirations of 

the Arab major ity in Palestine, insisting that its promises to Jews and Arabs did not conflict. Jews 

immigrated to Palestine in ever greater numbers during the Mandate period, and tension between 

Arabs and Jews and between each group and the British increased, leading t o frequent clashes. 

Following World War II, the plight of Jewish survivors of the Holocaust gave the demand for a 

Jewish home added urgency, while Arabs across the Middle East concurrently demanded self -

determination and independence from European colonial powers. 

In 1947, the United Nations General Assembly developed a partition plan (Resolution 181(II)) to 

divide Palestine into Jewish and Arab states, proposing U.N. trusteeship for Jerusalem and some 

surrounding areas. The leadership of the Jewish Yishuv (or polity) welcomed the plan because it 

appeared to confer legitimacy on the Jews ’ claims in Palestine despite their small numbers. The 

Palestinian Arab leadership and the League of Arab States (Arab League) rejected the plan, 

insisting both that the spec ific partition proposed and the entire concept of partition were unfair 

given Palestine ’s Arab majority. Debate on this question prefigured current debate about whether 

it is possible to have a state that both provides a secure Jewish homeland and is gover ned in 

accordance with democratic values and the principle of self -determination. 

After several months of violent conflict between Jews and Arabs, Britain officially ended its 

Mandate on May 14, 1948, at which point the state of Israel proclaimed its inde pendence and was 

immediately invaded by Arab armies. During and after the conflict, roughly 700,000 Palestinians 

were driven or fled from their homes, an occurrence Palestinians call the nakba 

(“ catastrophe ”). 275 Many became internationally designated refuge es after ending up in areas of 

Mandate -era Palestine controlled by Jordan (the West Bank) or Egypt (the Gaza Strip), or in 

nearby Arab states. Palestinians who remained in Israel became Israeli citizens. 

The conflict ended with armistice agreements betwee n Israel and its neighboring Arab states: 

Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria. The territory controlled by Israel within these 1949 -1950 

armistice lines is roughly the size of New Jersey. Israel has engaged in further armed conflict with 

neighbors on a numbe r of occasions since then —most notably in 1956, 1967, 1973, and 1982. 

Since the 1950s, Israel also has dealt with the threat of Palestinian guerrilla or terrorist attacks. In 

1979, Israel concluded a peace treaty with Egypt, followed in 1994 by a peace tre aty with Jordan, 

thus making another multi -front war less likely. Nevertheless, security challenges persist from 

Iran and groups allied with it, and from other developments in the Arab world.

# Political and Societal Evolution 

Israel ’s society and politics have evolved since its founding. In the first decades, Israeli society 

was dominated by secular Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jews who constituted the large majority 

of 19 th - and early 20 th -century Zionist immigrants. Many leaders from these immigrant 

commu nities sought to build a country dedicated to Western liberal and communitarian values. 

From 1948 to 1977, the social democratic Mapai/Labor movement led Israeli governing 

coalitions. 

The 1977 electoral victory of Menachem Begin ’s more nationalistic Likud party helped boost the 

influence of previously marginalized groups, particularly Mizrahi (Eastern) Jews who had 

immigrated to Israel from Arab countries and Iran. This electoral result came at a time when 

debate in Israel was intensifying over settlement i n the territories occupied during the 1967 Arab -

Israeli War. Begin and his successor in Likud, Yitzhak Shamir, helped drive the political agenda 

over the following 15 years. Although Labor under Yitzhak Rabin later initiated the Oslo peace 

process with the Palestinians, its political momentum slowed and reversed after Rabin ’s

assassination in 1995. 

Despite Labor ’s setbacks, its warnings that high Arab birth rates could eventually make it difficult 

for Israel to remain both a Jewish and a democratic state w hile ruling over the Palestinians gained 

traction among many Israelis. However, after the initial peace process negotiations collapsed in 

2000, the second Palestinian intifada (from 2000 to 2005 ) and conflicts with Hezbollah and 

Hamas after Israeli withdra wals from southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip strengthened the 

right -of -center figures . They have led Israel since 2000 and have supported separation between 

Israelis and Palestinians , while either opposing or placing significa nt conditions on negotiations .

Given the fragmentation of Israeli political parties under its electoral system, compromise among 

diverse groups is a necessity for forming and maintaining a governing coalition. The system 

generally gives smaller parties disproportionate influence on ke y issues important to their 

constituents. For example, two Haredi (ultra -Orthodox Jewish) parties have joined several 

governments in exchange for support on specific demands (i.e., subsidies and military exemptions 

to support traditional lifestyles). Speci al treatment for Haredim is anathema to many voters 

espousing more secular agendas, but the group comprises about 12% of the population and 

current forecasts project it will grow to 32% by 2065. 276 

Arab Israelis make up nearly 20% of the population. Their e xperiences are generally different 

from Jewish Israeli citizens in where and how they live, are educated, and socialize. While they 

had been historically excluded from governing coalitions, the inclusion of the United Arab List 

(UAL or Ra ’am) in the curren t government suggests that Arab -led parties may have greater 

leverage to seek benefits for their base constituents in exchange for joining future coalitions.

# Appendix C. Golan Heights 

On March 25, 2019, President Trump signed a proclamation stating that the United States 

recognizes the Golan Heights (hereafter, the Golan) to be part of the State of Israel. 277 The 

proclamation stated that “any possible future peace agreement in the region must account for 

Israel ’s need to protect itself from Sy ria and other regional threats ”278 —presumably including 

threats from Iran and Lebanese Hezbollah. Israel gained control of the Golan from Syria during 

the 1967 Arab -Israeli war, and effectively annexed it unilaterally by applying Israeli law to the 

region in 1981 (see  Figure C-1). 279 

Figure  C-1. Map of the Golan Heights

Notes: The DMZs could influence future border demarcation. The United States recognized the Golan Heights 

to be part of Israel in 2019 without specifying boundaries; however, U.N. Security Council Resolutio n 497, 

adopted on December 17, 1981, held that the area of the Golan Heights controlled by Israel’s military is 

occupied territory belonging to Syria. 

President Trump ’s proclamation changed long -standing U.S. policy on the Golan. Since 1967, 

successive U.S . Administrations supported the general international stance that the Golan is

The area under Israel’s control known as the Golan Heights is actually the western two -thirds of the geological 

Golan Heights —a plateau overlooking northern Israel . The eastern third remains under Syria’s control, other than the 

zone monitored by the U.N. Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF). For background information on the Golan 

Heights, see Central Intelligence Agency, Syria -Israel: The Golan Heights in Perspective , January 1 982, available at

U.S. proclamation, most other countries engaged with the issue maintain ed t hat the Golan ’s status 

ha d not changed. 280 The Syrian government denounced the 2019 U.S. policy change as an illegal 

violation of Syrian sovereignty and territorial integrity, and insisted that Syria wa s determined to 

recover the Golan. 281 

From 1967 until 201 1, various Israeli leaders had occasiona lly entered into indirect talks with 

Syria aimed at returning some portion of the Golan as part of a lasting peace agreement. 

However, the effect of civil war on Syria and the surrounding region, including an increas e in 

Iran ’s presence, may have influenced then Prime Minister Netanyahu to shift focus from 

negotiating with Syria on a “land for peace ” basis to obtaining international support for Israel ’s

claims of sovereignty. At certain stages of Iran ’s entrenchment i n conflict -ridden Syria, some 

Iranian missiles have targeted Israeli positions in the Golan. 282 

Since 1974, the U.N. Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) has patrolled an area of the 

Golan Heights between the regions controlled by Israel and Syria, with about 1,250 troops from 

nin e countries stationed there as of November 2021 .283 During that time, Israel ’s forces in the 

Golan have not faced serious military resistance to their continued deployment, despite some 

security threats and diplomatic challenges. P eriodic resolutions by the U.N. General Assembly 

have criticized Israel ’s occupation as hindering regional peace and Israel ’s settlement and de 

facto annexation of the Golan as illegal. 284 

As of 2019, about 23,900 Israeli settlers and 22,000 Druze lived in the Golan. 285 Most of the 

Druze, who are concentrated in the northern part of the Golan, retain Syrian citizenship while 

hav ing the option to apply for Israeli citizenship. 286 In December 2021 , the Israel i government 

announced a plan to double Israeli settlement in the Golan .287
