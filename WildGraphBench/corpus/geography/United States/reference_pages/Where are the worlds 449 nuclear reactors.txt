When nuclear power makes the news, it’s often for all the wrong reasons. The disasters at [Chernobyl](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2019/05/what-s-going-on-in-chernobyl-today/) and Fukushima, a[geing infrastructure](https://www.iea.org/publications/nuclear/) in current plants, the[spiralling costs](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-26/nuclear-power-risks-pricing-itself-out-of-europe-s-energy-market) of building new ones, and the unsolved issue of nuclear waste.

And yet as the world looks for ways to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels to take action on climate change, some think nuclear power, which [does not produce direct carbon dioxide emissions](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/nuclear/nuclear-power-and-the-environment.php), could play an increasingly important role in the future power mix.

An Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report looking at various routes the world could take to limit global warming to 1.5°C by 2050 predicts [an increase of nuclear power for electricity generation](https://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_spm_final.pdf) in most scenarios.

Last year, global [nuclear power generation reached pre-Fukushima levels](https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2019/march/global-energy-demand-rose-by-23-in-2018-its-fastest-pace-in-the-last-decade.html) as China added capacity and Japan restarted four reactors. And in total there are currently 449 reactors supplying about 11% of the world’s energy. So where are they?

[![Image 5: Bar chart showing the distribution of nuclear reactors around the world.](https://assets.weforum.org/editor/liI5s0igKrJ6NGp7rpqI2-5Tkb3z6-9-v5pNn7uBAF4.png)](https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/WorldStatistics/OperationalReactorsByCountry.aspx)

Which countries have the the most nuclear reactors Image: IAEA

**The top five**

[The United States has the most operational nuclear reactors](https://pris.iaea.org/PRIS/WorldStatistics/OperationalReactorsByCountry.aspx) on the planet – 96. Together they have a capacity of 97,565 MW, and last year [nuclear energy made up about 20% of the country’s electricity](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427&t=3) generation.

[France is home to 58 nuclear reactors](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-france-nuclearpower/france-to-cut-nuclear-energy-reliance-by-2035-minister-idUKKCN1NN0O4), which produce about 75% of the country’s electricity. It has said it will cut this amount to 50% by 2035.

China (48), Japan (37) and Russia (36) make up the rest of the top five.

The [Fostering Effective Energy Transition 2024 report](https://www.weforum.org/reports/fostering-effective-energy-transition-2023#report-nav) showed that after a decade of progress, the global energy transition has plateaued amid the global energy crisis and geopolitical volatilities.

The World Economic Forum’s [Centre for Energy and Materials](https://centres.weforum.org/centre-for-energy-and-materials/home) is driving the transition to a “fit for 2050” energy system. It is a cross-industry platform building new coalitions and delivering insights required for a sustainable, secure and just energy future.

Learn more about our impact:

*   **Clean energy in emerging economies:**We are advancing country-specific renewable energy finance solutions for [four of the biggest emerging and developing economies](https://www.weforum.org/impact/clean-energy-in-emerging-markets/): India, Brazil, Nigeria and Indonesia. In the latter, a new solar and battery initiative is bringing 15MW of clean energy to the East Sumba region – enough to power 4,000 homes and avoid 5.5KtCO₂ yearly emissions.
*   **Energy Transition Index:**We have [measured the progress of 120 countries](https://www.weforum.org/publications/fostering-effective-energy-transition-2024/) on the performance of their energy systems, enabling policymakers and businesses to identify the necessary actions for the energy transition.
*   **Mining and metals blockchain**: We released a proof of concept to [trace emissions](https://www.weforum.org/impact/the-responsible-sourcing-of-raw-materials) across the value chain using blockchain technology, helping accelerate global action for country-specific financing solutions.
*   **Clean power and electrification:**We are accelerating the adoption of [clean power and electric solutions](https://initiatives.weforum.org/clean-power-and-electrification/clean-power) in the next decade to help increase clean energy consumption threefold by 2030.

**The future of nuclear**

There are [more than 50 nuclear reactors under construction](https://www.statista.com/statistics/513671/number-of-under-construction-nuclear-reactors-worldwide/) worldwide, mostly in China.

Still, as Japanese efforts to reduce the effects of[radioactive contamination caused by the accident in Fukushima](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-japan-nuclear-water/eight-years-on-water-woes-threaten-fukushima-cleanup-idUKKCN1QP0ME) enter their eighth year, it seems nuclear power has work to do in cleaning up its reputation.

Industry body the World Nuclear Association says nuclear power is a safe means of generating electricity, and that[the risk of accidents at plants is low](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/safety-and-security/safety-of-plants/safety-of-nuclear-power-reactors.aspx) and declining.

Anti-nuclear campaigners say the high cost of nuclear means the money would be better spent on renewables and energy efficiency.
