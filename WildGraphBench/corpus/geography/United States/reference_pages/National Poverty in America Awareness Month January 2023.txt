From the U.S. Census Bureau, [Current Population Survey (CPS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/cps.html), Annual Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC):

*   [![Image 6: external-link.svg](https://www.census.gov/etc.clientlibs/census/clientlibs/census-pattern-library/resources/images/external-link.svg) Poverty in the United States: 2023 (September 10, 2024):](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2023/demo/p60-280.html)

#### Highlights

**_Official Poverty Measure_**

*   In 2023, the official poverty rate fell 0.4 percentage points to 11.1 percent. There were 36.8 million people in poverty in 2023, not statistically different from 2022 (Figure 1 and Table A-1).

*   Between 2022 and 2023, the official poverty rate decreased for White and non-Hispanic White individuals; women; 18- to 64-year-olds; unrelated individuals; all workers; less than full-time, year-round workers; and those with some college. The only group to experience a statistically significant increase in their official poverty rate was the Two or More Races population (Figure 2 and Tables A-1 and A-2).

**_Supplemental Poverty Measure_**

*   The SPM rate in 2023 was 12.9 percent, an increase of 0.5 percentage points from 2022 (Figure 6 and Table B-3).

*   The SPM child poverty rate increased 1.3 percentage points to 13.7 percent in 2023 (Figure 4 and Table B-3).

*   Social Security continues to be the largest anti-poverty program, moving 27.6 million individuals out of SPM poverty in 2023 (Figure 10 and Table B-7).
