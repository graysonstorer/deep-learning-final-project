Yes. Within each state there are full-time personnel who manage the day-to-day operations of the units in their state or territorial Guard. There is also a federal active duty force, which is centrally managed by National Guard Bureau and the Army National Guard Directorate in Washington, DC. Additionally, there are full-time personnel serving across the nation and worldwide as an interface between the Guard and other agencies. Also, keep in mind that when activated by either the governor or the president for state or federal active duty, Guard members serve full-time just like their active duty counterparts.

Most units also have a Family Readiness Group that provides support, information and assistance to soldiers and their families.

Family Services
---------------

The Army National Guard values the support and contributions of our Families across the country. Family Programs not only benefit service members and their Families, but also have a positive impact on a unit's morale and readiness.

### Mission

### Vision

Our purpose is to improve the quality of life of Soldiers and their Families in the Army National Guard by providing responsive, efficient and high quality support services that promote self-sufficiency, well-being and prosperity of individuals, Families, businesses and communities.

The program, led by Army Chaplains, is holistic, and preventative, and committed to the restoration, and preservation of Army families, especially those near crisis.As members of the world’s premier fighting force, Army Soldiers sacrifice for our country every day, and so do their loved ones. Military life places extreme hardship on relationships, especially in wartime, so the Army – backed by Congress - has committed unprecedented resources to help Soldiers build stronger relationships through the Strong Bonds Program. Strong Bonds has specialized programs for single Soldiers, couples and Families. Those Soldiers being deployed or redeployed can also learn special coping tactics. With Strong Bonds, participants not only bond with their loved ones they bond with other Army families, chaplains and the Army community as a whole.

Our National Guard mission makes us different. Unlike the Army Reserve, we have a dual mission, meaning we answer to both state and federal governments. So Guard Soldiers can be deployed by either the governor of their resident state or the president of the United States, depending on where they are needed most.

![Image 21: Expand List item 2158](https://www.nationalguard.mil/images/max.gif)![Image 22: Collapse List item 2158](https://www.nationalguard.mil/images/min.gif)How will my membership in the National Guard affect my civilian job[](https://www.nationalguard.mil/About-the-Guard/Army-National-Guard/FAQ/)

Generally, membership in the Guard has a positive influence on civilian jobs. The skills and leadership you acquire are sought after by many employers. Some soldiers find their civilian and military jobs complement each other, while others seek to add diversity to their lives and skills by serving in a capacity quite different than their civilian occupation. Regardless, your membership within the Guard should not have a negative impact on your civilian employment.

If you are called to active service, your employer is required by law to allow you to return to the same (or equal) job you had when you left. Also, there are federal laws that prevent employers from discriminating against an employee due to his or her membership in the National Guard. The Employer Support of the Guard and Reserve organization [http://www.esgr.mil/](http://www.esgr.mil/) can provide additional information.

Contact your recruiter or retention NCO to discuss your situation.

Guard members make excellent employees. Guard members receive world-class leadership development and technical training, both when they enter the Guard and throughout their career (including the time of their employment at your company, at no cost to you). They have real-world experience in their field of specialization, often managing complex tasks in difficult environments. Most Guard members have experience leading teams and mentoring subordinates. In addition, many Guard members have deployment and combat experience, proving their ability to adapt and thrive in difficult and ever-changing environments while remaining focused on accomplishing their mission. You can expect Guard members to perform as natural leaders and high achievers within your organization. Like all members of the military, members of the National Guard are subject to random testing for illegal drug use. National Guard members are required to pass a physical fitness test at least once a year, and are required to conform to the military's standards for height, weight and grooming.

Your total enlistment period will be eight years, but you can serve as little as three or six years, and spend the remainder in IRR (Individual Ready Reserve). IRR Soldiers don't train with a unit, but can still be called up in the event of an emergency. Your local recruiter can explain how this works, discuss your options with you, and help you make the best choice for your needs.

Initially, all personnel are required to attend initial entry training (IET), which can usually be scheduled to meet civilian occupation scheduling requirements. Duration and location of IET varies according to career specialty - a recruiter can provide specific information for each Military Occupational Specialty.

Army National Guard members are required to attend one drill weekend each month and one two-week annual training period each year (usually during the summer). Weekend drills are usually scheduled over a Saturday and Sunday each month, but can occasionally include reporting for duty on Friday night.

Veterans who have served in any branch of the military have additional options available to them, including a "Try One" program which allows a veteran to serve for only one year on a trial basis before committing to a full enlistment. A recruiter can provide further details. To contact a recruiter please visit [http://www.nationalguard.com/](http://www.nationalguard.com/) or call 1-800-GO-GUARD.

The Army National Guard offers a large selection of specialties throughout a range of skills. Specialties are divided into three major categories:

*   Combat (Infantry, Artillery, Armor, Aviation, Air Defense)
*   Combat Support (Engineer, Chemical, Military Police, Signal, Military Intelligence)
*   Combat Service Support (Finance, Public Affairs, Personnel, Supply, Maintenance, Logistics, Transportation)

![Image 41: Expand List item 2158](https://www.nationalguard.mil/images/max.gif)![Image 42: Collapse List item 2158](https://www.nationalguard.mil/images/min.gif)What is the Army National Guard[](https://www.nationalguard.mil/About-the-Guard/Army-National-Guard/FAQ/)

The Army National Guard is two things. When activated for a federal mission, it is a Reserve Component of the U.S. Army. When not activated, it is a state-based military force under the control of the governors. As a state force, the National Guard can trace its roots back to the militia of the various colonies, and thus is older than the United States. The Army National Guard is composed of full time and part time soldiers, as well as civilians, who together serve both state and federal governments. The difference between the Guard and other branches is that while Guard units are combat-trained and can be deployed overseas, they are just as likely to serve in their home communities during an emergency.

During local emergencies, Guard units assist local emergency responders to help residents endangered by storms, floods, fires and other disasters. Guard units deployed overseas may see combat, but are often found building schools and hospitals, training local police, or teaching local farmers more efficient techniques and better uses of their land. In many cases, the skills Guard members acquire in their civilian jobs make them the ideal people to teach these same skills to the citizens of other countries.

![Image 43: Expand List item 2158](https://www.nationalguard.mil/images/max.gif)![Image 44: Collapse List item 2158](https://www.nationalguard.mil/images/min.gif)What is the National Guard's mission[](https://www.nationalguard.mil/About-the-Guard/Army-National-Guard/FAQ/)

The Guard has a unique dual mission, with both federal and state responsibilities. During peacetime, Guard forces are commanded by the governor through a state adjutant general. The governor can call the Guard into action during local or state-wide emergencies, such as storms, drought and civil disturbances. In addition, the President can activate the National Guard to participate in federal missions, both domestically and overseas. When federalized, Guard units fall under the same military chain of command as active duty and reserve troops.
