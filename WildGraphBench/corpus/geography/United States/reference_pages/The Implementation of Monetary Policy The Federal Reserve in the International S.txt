he Federal Reserve was created in 1913 to promote greater financial 

stability and help avoid banking panics like those that had plunged the 

country into deep economic contractions in the late nineteenth and 

early twentieth centuries. 

Over the past century, as the U.S. and global financial system have 

evolved, the Federal Reserve’s role in promoting financial stability has 

necessarily changed with it. The 2007–09 financial crisis and the sub -

sequent deep recession revealed shortcomings in the financial system 

infrastructure and the framework for supervising and regulating it (see 

figure 4.1 ). Indeed, reforms enacted under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street 

Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 assigned the Federal 

Reserve new responsibilities in the effort to promote financial system 

stability and keep pace with changing dynamics and innovation in the 

broader economy.

# What Is Financial Stability? 

A financial system is considered stable when financial institutions— 

banks, savings and loans, and other financial product and service pro -

viders—and financial markets are able to provide households, commu -

nities, and businesses with the resources, services, and products they 

need to invest, grow, and participate in a well-functioning economy. 

These resources and services include 

• business lines of credit, mortgages, student loans, and the other 

critical offerings of a sophisticated financial system; and 

• savings accounts, brokerage services, and retirement accounts, 

among many others. 

## Effective Linking of Savers and Investors 

## with Borrowers and Businesses 

A healthy and stable financial system links, at the lowest possible cost, 

savers and investors seeking to grow their money with borrowers and 

businesses in need of funds. If this critical role of intermediation be -

tween savers and borrowers is disrupted in times of stress, the adverse 

impact will be felt across the economy. 

And such disruption can carry a very high price. As a result, financial 

stability in its most basic form could be thought of as a condition 

where financial institutions and markets are able to support consumers, 

communities, and businesses even in an otherwise stressed economic 

environment. 

## Keeping Institutions and 

## Market Structures Resilient 

To support financial stability, it is critical that financial institutions and 

market structures are resilient, so that they are able to bend but not The Federal Reserve System  Purposes & Functions  57 

break under extreme economic pressures. Such a dynamic does not 

mean that market prices will never rise or fall quickly. Volatility may 

reflect changes in economic conditions and would be a concern with 

respect to financial stability only when institutions and markets are not 

adequately prepared. Financial stability depends on firms and critical 

financial market structures having the financial strength and operational 

skills to manage through volatility and continue to provide their essential 

products and services to consumers, communities, and other businesses. 

# Monitoring Risk across 

# the Financial System 

The Federal Reserve and other bank regulators have long supervised 

individual banks and financial institutions to make sure they are run in 

a “prudent” and “safe and sound” manner and are not taking exces -

sive risks. The goal of this traditional “microprudential” supervisory 

Box 4.1. Financial Stability and the Founding of the Federal Reserve 

Financial stability considerations were a key element in the founding of the Federal Reserve System. Indeed, it was created in 

response to the Panic of 1907, which was at the time the latest in a series of severe financial panics that befell the nation in 

the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 

The 1907 panic led to the creation 

of the National Monetary Commis -

sion, whose 1911 report was a major 

impetus to the Federal Reserve Act, 

signed into law by President Woodrow 

Wilson on December 23, 1913. Upon 

enactment, the process of organizing 

and opening the Board and the Reserve 

Banks across the country began. On 

November 16, 1914, the Federal 

Reserve System began full-fledged 

operations. 

In the words of one Federal Reserve Act 

author, U.S. Senator Robert Latham 

Owen of Oklahoma, “It should always 

be kept in mind that . . . it is the 

prevention of panic, the protection of 

our commerce, the stability of business 

conditions, and the maintenance in 

active operation of the productive 

energies of the nation which is the 

question of vital importance.” 

For more information on the Federal 

Reserve founding, see  The Federal 

Reserve Act: Its Origin and Principles ,

of St. Louis website ( https://fraser. 

stlouisfed.org/docs/publications/books/ 

fra_owen_1919.pdf ). 58  Promoting Financial System Stability 

approach is to ensure individual banks and financial institutions are less 

likely to fail and to help avoid any associated adverse circumstances for 

their customers. 

In the heat of the 2007–09 financial crisis, however, it became clear 

this microprudential focus did not adequately identify risks that devel -

oped  across and between  markets and institutions and that, in turn, 

threatened to set off a cascade of failures that could have undermined 

the entire financial system. Thus, a central element of the Dodd-Frank 

Act—the landmark legislative response to the 2007–09 crisis—is the 

requirement that the Federal Reserve and other financial regulatory 

agencies look across the entire financial system for risks, adopting a 

macroprudential approach to supervision and regulation. 

Whereas a traditional—or microprudential—approach to supervision 

and regulation focuses on the safety and soundness of individual insti -

tutions, the macroprudential approach centers on the stability of the 

financial system as a whole (see  section 5 , “Supervising and Regulating 

Financial Institutions and Activities,” on page 72, for more on micro-

and macroprudential supervision). 

## Types of Financial System 

## Vulnerabilities and Risks 

Federal Reserve staff regularly and systematically assess a standard set 

of vulnerabilities as part of a Federal Reserve System macroprudential 

financial stability review: 

• asset valuations and risk appetite 

• leverage in the financial system 

• liquidity risks and maturity transformation by the financial system 

• borrowing by the nonfinancial sector (households and nonfinancial 

businesses)

policies and monetary policy (see  figure 4.2 ). They also inform Federal 

Reserve interactions with broader monitoring efforts, such as those by 

the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) and the Financial Stabil -

ity Board. 

Asset Valuations and Risk Appetite 

Overvalued assets constitute a fundamental vulnerability because the 

unwinding of high prices can be destabilizing in the financial system 

and economy, especially if the assets are widely held and the values 

are supported by excessive leverage, maturity transformation, or risk 

opacity. Moreover, stretched asset valuations may be an indicator of a 

broader buildup in risk-taking. 

However, it is very difficult to judge whether an asset price is overval -

ued relative to fundamentals. As a result, analysis typically considers a 

range of possible valuation metrics, developments in areas where asset 

prices are rising especially rapidly or into which investor flows have 

been considerable, or the implications of unusually low or high levels of 

volatility in certain markets.

Leverage in the Financial System 

Highly leveraged financial system intermediaries—those with significantly 

more debt than equity—can amplify the effect of negative shocks in the 

financial system and broad economy ( see  figure 4.3 ). 

For example, if a highly leveraged institution needs to shrink its balance 

sheet in response to an otherwise standard economic downturn, the 

resulting contraction in credit will have broader economic implications. 

Moreover, sufficiently large losses for highly leveraged institutions can 

Figure 4.3. Monitoring leverage in the financial system 

The collective financial strength of the banking sector—and its prevailing activities—can be an important indicator in 

understanding risks to the nation’s financial stability. The Federal Reserve focuses on metrics like the ratio of common equity 

to risk-weighted assets in the banking sector, which has risen in recent years as a reflection of tougher capital standards for 

major banking institutions.

internationally active banking organization, generally with at least $250 billion in total consolidated assets or at least 

$10 billion in total on-balance-sheet foreign exposure. The shaded bars indicate periods of business recession as defined by

lead to “fire sales,” where assets are unloaded quickly at extremely low 

prices. Fire sales, in turn, increase the potential for runs on banks—and 

even on nonbanks—if liabilities have short maturities. 

The Federal Reserve monitors leverage in the banking sector with the 

help of an extensive data collection program. Nevertheless, these 

monitoring efforts are complicated by off-balance-sheet exposures and 

rapidly changing trading exposures. Monitoring leverage in the nonbank 

sector (hedge funds, for example) proves even more difficult, but periodic 

surveys of the providers of leverage through the Senior Credit Officer 

Opinion Survey (SCOOS) offers v aluable insights. 

Liquidity Risks and Maturity Transformation 

by the Financial System 

One key benefit provided by the financial system is to transform short-

maturity (or liquid) liabilities into long-maturity (illiquid) assets. This 

function is done primarily through the traditional banking system or 

other depository institutions, but it also occurs outside the banking 

system, for example, through money market mutual funds. 

Liquidity and maturity transformation is productive in the sense that it 

allows investment projects to be funded with long-term financing while 

still satisfying the liquidity needs of lenders. However, the experience 

of the 2007–09 financial crisis demonstrated that liquidity and maturity 

transformation introduces systemic vulnerabilities that can threaten the 

broader economy (see  box 4.2 , “Responding to Financial System Emer -

gencies: The Lender of Last Resort Concept in Central Banking”). 

When a systemwide shock results in all lenders demanding liquidity at 

the same time, institutions engaged in this maturity transformation are 

at risk of being run. Deposit insurance provides protection within the 

traditional banking system. Nevertheless, some assets such as repur -

chase agreements (or “repos”), asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP), 

or money market funds are also subject to run risk and, indeed, came 

under considerable pressure during the crisis. For this reason, the Fed -

eral Reserve actively monitors, as best it can given available data and

measurement, both liquidity risk and the degree of maturity transfor -

mation in the financial system. 

Borrowing by the Nonfinancial Sector 

Excessive credit in the private nonfinancial sector can provide a trans -

mission channel for a disruption in financial markets to affect the real 

economy ( see  figure 4.4 ). Highly indebted households and nonfinan -

cial businesses may have a difficult time withstanding negative shocks 

to incomes or asset values, and may be forced to curtail spending in 

ways that amplify the effects of financial shocks. In turn, losses among 

households and businesses can lead to mounting losses at financial 

institutions, creating an adverse feedback loop. The Federal Reserve 

monitors measures of vulnerabilities in the nonfinancial sector includ -

Figure 4.4. Monitoring borrowing in the nonfinancial sector 

Borrowing by households and nonfinancial sector businesses can also influence financial stability. The Federal Reserve focuses 

on metrics like the ratio of household and nonfinancial business credit to nominal U.S. gross domestic product. This ratio 

dropped below peaks around the time of the 2007–09 crisis.

This monitoring program is complemented by a broader effort to foster 

greater transparency in financial markets through improved data col -

lection and enhanced disclosures by regulated financial market partici -

pants. Greater transparency helps lead to meaningful implementation 

of macroprudential regulatory and supervisory policies to target build -

ing vulnerabilities and to pre-position the financial system to be better 

able to absorb shocks. 

## Why Proactive Monitoring of Domestic 

## and Foreign Markets Matters 

The changing nature of risks and fluctuations in financial markets and 

the broader economy require timely monitoring of the effects of condi -

tions in domestic and foreign financial markets on financial institutions 

and even in the nonfinancial sector in order to identify the buildup of 

vulnerabilities that might require further study or policy action. 

To this end, the Federal Reserve maintains a flexible, forward-looking fi -

nancial stability monitoring program to help inform policymakers of the 

financial system’s vulnerabilities to a range of potential adverse events 

or shocks. Such a monitoring program is a critical part of a broader 

Federal Reserve System effort to assess and address vulnerabilities in 

the U.S. financial system. In the case of individual institutions, the Fed -

eral Reserve may take more direct action and in various ways (for more 

information, see “ Macroprudential Supervision and Monitoring ” on 

page 98 in  section 5 , “Supervising and Regulating Financial Institutions 

and Activities”).

64  Promoting Financial System Stability 

Box 4.2. Responding to Financial System Emergencies: The Lender of Last Resort Concept in Central Banking 

The idea that a central bank should provide liquidity to support the financial system was refined by nineteenth-century econo-mist Walter Bagehot, who suggested that during times of financial panic or crisis, a central bank should lend quickly and freely, at a penalty rate of interest, to any borrower with good collateral. 

When a major shock—like a natural disaster, a terrorist attack, or a financial panic—occurs that severely stresses the financial system, people, businesses, and financial institutions need access to money and credit. Indeed, having this liquidity available can improve confidence in the economy and restore calm to markets, bolstering the stability of the financial system. 

General authority during times of crisis. To provide liquidity during times of crisis, the Federal Reserve—like many central banks—is empowered to function as a “lender of last resort” (LOLR), and it uses different tools to fulfill this role. In an emergency, the Federal Reserve has the power to provide liquidity to depository institutions using standard, traditional tools, like open market operations and discount window lend-ing. Under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act, the U.S. central bank also has authority to provide liquidity to nondepository institutions in “unusual and exigent circumstances.” Although the Federal Reserve has rarely exercised this LOLR clause enacted in 1932, it did use it during the 2007–09 financial crisis to prevent harm to the U.S. economy. 

Broad-based lending only. Under amendments enacted under the Dodd-Frank Act, emergency lending programs under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act must be broad-based and not designed to support a single institution, among other require-ments. In addition, Congress requires that the Federal Reserve ensure that taxpayers are protected against losses. For a fuller discussion of how each of these lending tools works, see 

section 3, “Conducting  Monetary Policy,” on page 20 (see also the 2013 Federal Reserve paper “Financial Stability Monitoring,” www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/ feds/2013/201321/201321pap.pdf). 

Federal Reserve lending under normal and “unusual and exigent” circumstances 

As a major financial crisis began to unfold in 2007 and its magnitude became clearer, the Federal Reserve invoked its statutory authority to lend to qualified institutions with adequate collateral. At its peak, Federal Reserve credit outstanding reached more than $1.2 trillion—but within four years it had abated to near pre-crisis levels as economic and financial conditions improved.

vulnerabilities in the financial system and how government policies can 

mitigate such risks. 

The Federal Reserve actively engages in financial stability research to 

improve understanding of issues related to financial stability and to 

engage with the broader research community on crucial policy matters. 

This engagement often involves collaboration with researchers at other 

domestic and international institutions. 

# Macroprudential Supervision and 

# Regulation of Large, Complex 

# Financial Institutions 

Large, complex financial institutions interact with financial markets and 

the broader economy in a manner that may—during times of stress and 

in the absence of an appropriate regulatory framework and effective 

supervision—lead to financial instability. The Federal Reserve promotes 

the safety and soundness of these institutions through robust supervi -

sion and regulation programs, two components of which are integral to 

its macroprudential efforts. 

## Monitoring Systemically Important 

## Financial Institutions 

The macroprudential approach informs Federal Reserve supervision 

of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs)—including large 

bank holding companies (BHCs), the U.S. operations of certain foreign 

banking organizations (FBOs), and financial market utilities (FMUs). In 

ad dition, the Federal Reserve serves as a “consolidated supervisor” of 

nonbank financial companies that the FSOC has determined should 

be supervised by the Federal Reserve Board and subject to prudential 

Types of systemically important financial institutions

standards. (See “ Domestic and International Cooperation and Coordi -

nation ” on page 68 for more information on the FSOC.) 

The Federal Reserve actively monitors indicators of the riskiness of 

SIFIs, both individually as well as through interlinkages in the broader 

network of financial institutions, to help identify vulnerabilities. It also 

imposes certain regulatory requirements on SIFIs in order to limit po -

tentially risky activities by these institutions and to mitigate spillover of 

distress into the broader economy. If a SIFI were to become distressed, 

disruptions in the financial system could arise from direct losses im -

posed on SIFI counterparties, contagion, fire sales effects, or a loss of 

critical services. 

SIFIs are also subject to additional capital and liquidity regulations 

imposed by the Federal Reserve in order to help mitigate some of the ad -

ditional risks they pose to the financial system as a whole, given their size 

and interconnectedness. 

Moreover, during the 2007–09 financial crisis, the lack of effective 

resolution strategies contributed to the pernicious spillovers of distress 

at or between individual institutions and from those institutions to the 

broader economy. The Federal Reserve, in collaboration with other U.S. 

agencies, has continued to work with large financial institutions to de -

velop a range of recovery and resolution strategies in the event of their 

distress or failure. Improvements in resolution planning are intended to, 

among other things, mitigate adverse effects from perceptions of “too 

big to fail” and contribute to more orderly conditions in the financial 

system if institutions face strains or fail. (For more information on re -

covery and resolution planning activity, see  section 5 , “Supervising and 

Regulating Financial Institutions and Activities,” on page 72.) 

## Str ess Testing of Key Financial Institutions 

One important element of enhanced supervision of SIFIs is the stress-

testing process, which includes the Dodd-Frank Act stress tests and the The Federal Reserve System  Purposes & Functions  67 

Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review. In addition to fostering 

the safety and soundness of the participating institutions, the stress test 

program includes macroprudential elements such as 

• examination of the loss-absorbing capacity of institutions under a 

common macroeconomic scenario that has features similar to the 

strains experienced in a severe recession and which includes, as ap -

propriate, identified salient risks; 

• conducting horizontal testing across large institutions to understand 

the potential correlated exposures; and 

• consideration of the effects of counterparty distress on the largest, 

most interconnected firms. 

The macroeconomic and financial scenarios that are used in the stress 

tests have proved to be an important macroprudential tool. The Federal 

Reserve adjusts the severity of the macroeconomic scenario used in the 

stress tests in a way that counteracts the natural tendency for risks to 

build within the financial system during periods of strong economic 

activity. The scenarios can also be used to assess the financial system’s 

vulnerability to particularly significant risks and to highlight certain risks 

to institutions participating in the testing. 

## Intersection of Financial Stability 

## and Monetary Policy 

Promotion of financial stability strongly complements the primary 

goals of monetary policy—maximum employment and price stability. A 

smoothly operating financial system promotes the efficient allocation of 

saving and investment, facilitating economic growth and employment. 

And price stability contributes not only to the efficient allocation of re -

sources in the real economy (that is, the part of the economy that pro -

duces goods and services), but also to reduced uncertainty and efficient 

pricing in financial markets that, in turn, supports financial stability. 

> “Stress testing” of large financial institutions
> In 2015, 31 institutions participated in the Federal Reserve stress testing pro-cess, which occurs annually. For more information, see the “Stress Tests and Capital Planning” web page, located on the Banking Informa-tion & Regulation section of the Federal Reserve Board’s website (www.federalreserve. gov/bankinforeg/stress-tests-capital-planning.htm).

68  Promoting Financial System Stability 

# Domestic and International 

# Cooperation and Coordination 

Economic and financial volatility in any country can have negative 

consequences for the world, but sizable and significant spillovers are 

almost assured from an economy that is large. 

In its role promoting financial stability, the Federal Reserve cooperates 

and coordinates with many other domestic and international regulatory 

and policy entities. The FSOC is an important forum for cooperation 

with other domestic agencies (see  figure 4.5 ). The primary venues for 

international cooperation occur through the Basel Committee on Bank -

ing Supervision and the Financial Stability Board. 

## Domestic Engagement through the 

## Financial Stability Oversight Council 

The FSOC, created in 2010 under the Dodd-Frank Act and chaired 

by the U.S. Treasury Secretary, draws on the expertise of the Federal 

Reserve and other regulators to proactively identify risks to financial 

stability, promote market discipline, and respond to emerging threats. 

The Chair of the Federal Reserve is a member of the FSOC, and the 

Federal Reserve works to support the activities of the FSOC and other 

U.S. government agencies in the pursuit of financial stability. 

Through collaborative participation in the FSOC, U.S. financial regula -

tors monitor not only institutions but the financial system as a whole. 

The Federal Reserve plays an important role in this macroprudential 

framework: it assists in monitoring financial risks, analyzes the implica -

tions of those risks for financial stability, and identifies steps that can be 

taken to mitigate those risks.

Figure 4.6. Monitoring financial system stability requires global cooperation 

What happens in the global economy can influence—sometimes greatly—the stability of the U.S. economy. Because the U.S. 

dollar is a widely used global currency and because the world’s economies are interdependent, the Federal Reserve works 

closely with central banks and other public authorities around the world to address international financial issues and promote 

financial stability.

Overview/Federal Reserve engagement 

Central banks 

Established: 1668 or later 

Location: Throughout the world 

Website:  www.bis.org/central_bank_hub_ 

overview.htm 

Nearly all developed and developing nations maintain central banks to promote a sound and 

stable financial system and well-functioning economies. Indeed, Federal Reserve officials en -

gage regularly and collectively with other central banks to discuss broad trends affecting the 

global financial system; one-on-one bank engagement also occurs in special circumstances 

where coordination and cooperation can help keep the global financial system operating 

smoothly. 

Bank of International Settlements 

Established: 1930 

Location: Basel, Switzerland 

Website:  www.bis.org 

The Bank of International Settlements seeks, among other things, to foster discussion and 

facilitate collaboration among central banks and supports dialogue with other authorities 

that are responsible for promoting financial stability. The Federal Reserve participates in the 

deliberations of this financial organization, whose members include 60 member central banks, 

representing countries from around the world that together make up about 95 percent of 

world gross domestic product. 

Financial Stability Board 

Established: 2009 

Location: Basel, Switzerland 

Website:  www.fsb.org 

The Financial Stability Board (FSB), successor to the Financial Stability Forum, promotes 

stability in the international financial system through enhanced cooperation among various 

national and international supervisory bodies and international financial institutions. The Fed -

eral Reserve Board and other U.S. agencies participate in FSB efforts, which specifically seek 

to coordinate the development of regulatory, supervisory, and other financial sector policies. 

G7 & G20 

Established: 1975 (as G6) 

Location: Varies by nation hosting 

Website: Varies by nation hosting 

The Group of Seven (G7) is an informal bloc of industrialized democracies (also including 

Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, and the United Kingdom) that meets annually to 

discuss global economic issues. Federal Reserve officials engage regularly with the G7 and 

G20 to discuss macroeconomic policy surveillance, the international financial system, and a 

wide range of policy issues such as development and policy proposals to encourage strong, 

sustainable, and balanced growth. 

International Monetary Fund 

Established: 1945 

Location: Washington, DC 

Website:  www.imf.org 

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) works to “foster global monetary cooperation, secure 

financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable 

economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world.” The Federal Reserve is a member 

of the International Monetary and Financial Committee, which advises and reports to the IMF 

Board of Governors on the supervision and management of the international monetary and 

financial system, including on responses to unfolding events that may disrupt the system. 

Organisation for Economic 

Co-operation and Development 

Established: 1961 

Location: Paris, France 

Website:  www.oecd.org 

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) promotes “policies 

that will improve the economic and social well-being of people around the world.” The 

Federal Reserve participates in several OECD forums to discuss current economic issues and 

projections for the global economic outlook, and to promote policies that will improve global 

economic well-being. 

World Bank 

Established: 1944 

Location: Washington, DC 

Website:  www.worldbank.org 

The World Bank functions as a cooperative of 189 member countries. These member countries, 

or shareholders, are represented by a board of governors, who are the ultimate policymak -

ers at the World Bank. Generally, the governors are member countries’ ministers of finance 

or ministers of development. The Federal Reserve interacts informally with the World Bank, 

largely through the International Monetary Fund. The Federal Reserve System  Purposes & Functions  71 

## Engagement with Regulatory 

## Authorities Abroad 

The Federal Reserve participates in international bodies, such as the 

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability 

Board, to address issues associated with the interconnected global 

financial system and the global activities of large U.S. financial institu -

tions ( see  figure 4.6 ). 

Through both venues, the Federal Reserve is engaged with the interna -

tional community in monitoring the global financial system and promot -

ing the adoption of sound policies across countries.
