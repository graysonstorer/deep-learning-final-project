The U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extends 200 nautical miles offshore, encompassing diverse ecosystems and vast natural resources, such as fisheries and energy and other mineral resources. The U.S. EEZ is the largest in the world, spanning over 13,000 miles of coastline and containing 3.4 million square nautical miles of ocean—larger than the combined land area of all fifty states. (A square nautical mile is equal to 1.3 square miles.) U.S. states also have jurisdiction over a significant portion of the Great Lakes. This chain of freshwater lakes and its tributaries constitute the largest reservoir of fresh surface water on the planet, containing 6.5 quadrillion gallons of fresh water and covering an area of about 72,000 square nautical miles. The Great Lakes’ U.S. coastline borders eight states and is roughly the same length as the entire Atlantic Coast.
