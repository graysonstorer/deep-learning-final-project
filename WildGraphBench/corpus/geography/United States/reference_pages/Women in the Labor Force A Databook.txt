# Women in the Labor Force: 

# A Databook 

# Over the past 4 decades, women have made notable 

## changes in their labor force activities. Labor force 

## participation  is  significantly  higher  among  women 

## today than it was in the 1970s, particularly among women 

## with children, and a larger share of women are working full 

## time and year round. In addition, women have increasingly 

## attained higher levels of education: among women ages 

## 25 to 64 who are in the labor force, the proportion with a 

## college degree roughly tripled from 1970 to 2011. Women’s 

## earnings as a proportion of men’s earnings also have grown 

## over time. In 1979, women working full time earned 62 

## percent of what men did; in 2011, women’s earnings were 

## 82 percent of men’s. 

## This report presents historical and current labor force 

## and earnings data for women and men from the Current 

## Population Survey (CPS). The CPS is a national monthly 

## survey of approximately 60,000 households conducted 

## by the U.S. Census Bureau for the U.S. Bureau of Labor 

## Statistics. Unless otherwise noted, data are annual 

## averages from the CPS. For a detailed description of the 

## source of the data and an explanation of concepts and 

## definitions used, see the Technical Notes at the end of 

## this report. 

# Selected demographic characteristics 

## Women’s labor force participation rate peaked at 60.0 

## percent in 1999, following several decades in which 

## women increasingly entered the labor market. In 2011, 

## 58.1 percent of women were in the labor force, down 0.5 

## percentage point from 2010. (See tables 1 and 2.) 

## The overall unemployment rate for women in 2011 was 

## 8.5 percent, compared with 9.4 percent for men. Women’s 

## jobless rates varied by race and Hispanic ethnicity. Asian 

## women had the lowest rate (7.3 percent), followed by 

## White (7.5 percent), Hispanic (11.8 percent), and Black 

## (14.1 percent) women. (See tables 1, 2, and 3.) 

## The labor force participation rate of mothers with children 

## under 18 years of age was 70.9 percent in March 2011, 

## down slightly from 2010. (See tables 6 and 7.) (Data 

## were collected in the 2011 Annual Social and Economic 

## Supplement to the CPS.) 

## Errors were found in table 26 of this report. The table was reissued on March 2 6, 2013, to correct the data. 

# U.S.  BUREAU  OF  LABOR  STATISTICS 2 BLS Reports  │ February 2013  • www.bls.gov W O M E N I N T H E L A B O R F O R C E : A D ATA B O O K 

## In general, mothers with children 6 to 17 years of age are 

## more likely to participate in the labor force (76.5 percent 

## in March 2011) than mothers with children under 6 years 

## of age (64.2 percent). Also, unmarried mothers have higher 

## participation rates than married mothers. In March 2011, 

## 74.9 percent of unmarried mothers with children under 

## 18 years old were in the labor force, compared with 69.1 

## percent of married mothers. (See tables 6 and 7.) (Data 

## were collected in the 2011 Annual Social and Economic 

## Supplement to the CPS.) 

# Educational attainment 

## The educational attainment of women ages 25 to 64 in the 

## labor force has risen substantially over the past 40 years. 

## In 2011, 37 percent of these women held college degrees, 

## compared with 11 percent in 1970. About 7 percent of 

## women had less than a high school diploma (that is, did not 

## graduate high school) in 2011, down from 34 percent in 

## 1970. (See table 9.) 

# Occupation and industry 

## In 2011, women accounted for 51 percent of all persons 

## employed in management, professional, and related 

## occupations, somewhat more than their share of total 

## employment  (47  percent).  The  share  of  women  in  specific 

## occupations within this large category varied. For example, 

## 14 percent of architects and engineers and 34 percent of 

## physicians and surgeons were women, whereas 61 percent 

## of accountants and auditors and 82 percent of elementary 

## and middle school teachers were women. (See table 11.) 

## Employed Asian and White women were more likely (44 

## and 42 percent, respectively) to work in higher paying 

## management, professional, and related occupations in 2011 

## than were employed Black (34 percent) and Hispanic (25 

## percent) women. Meanwhile, Hispanic (31 percent) and 

## Black (28 percent) women were more likely than White (20 

## percent) and Asian (22 percent) women to work in service 

## occupations. (See table 12.) 

## In 2011, women accounted for at least 50 percent of 

## all  workers  within  several  industry  sectors:  financial 

## activities, education and health services, leisure and 

## hospitality, and other services. However, women were 

## substantially underrepresented (relative to their share of 

## total employment) in agriculture, mining, construction, 

## manufacturing, and in transportation and utilities. (See 

## table 14.) 

# Earnings 

## Women who worked full time in wage and salary jobs 

## had median usual weekly earnings of $684 in 2011. This 

## represented 82 percent of men’s median weekly earnings 

## ($832). Among women, earnings were higher for Asians 

## ($751) and Whites ($703) than for Blacks ($595) and 

## Hispanics ($518). Women’s-to-men’s earnings ratios were 

## higher for Blacks and Hispanics (both 91 percent) than for 

## Whites (82 percent) and Asians (77 percent). Users should 

## note that the comparisons of earnings in this report are on a 

## broad level and do not control for many factors that may be 

## significant  in  explaining  earnings  differences.  (See  table  16.) 

## In 2011, female full-time wage and salary workers ages 

## 25 and older with only a high school diploma had median 

## usual weekly earnings of $554. This represented 81 

## percent of the earnings for women with an associate’s 

## degree ($682) and 56 percent of those for women with a 

## bachelor’s degree or higher ($998). (See table 17.) 

# Hours of work 

## In 2011, 27 percent of employed women usually worked 

## part time—that is, fewer than 35 hours per week. In 

## comparison, 11 percent of employed men usually worked 

## part time. (See table 20.) 

## Women employed in nonagricultural industries worked 

## fewer hours per week than men in 2011. On average, 

## women worked 35.6 hours per week, compared with 40.6 

## hours for men. (See table 21.) 

## Of all women who worked at some point during calendar 

## year 2010, 59 percent worked full time and year round, 

## compared with 41 percent in 1970. During the same period, 

## the proportion of men who worked full time and year round 

## rose slightly, from 66 to 69 percent. (Data were collected 

## in the 1971 and 2011 Annual Social and Economic 

## Supplements  to  the  CPS  and  reflect  earnings  and  work 

## experience in the previous calendar year.) (See table 22.) BLS Reports  │ February 2013  • www.bls.gov  3W O M E N I N T H E L A B O R F O R C E : A D ATA B O O K 

# Married-couple families 

## Among married-couple families, 54 percent had earnings 

## from both the wife and the husband in 2010, compared with 

## 44 percent in 1967. Couples in which only the husband 

## worked represented 19 percent of married-couple families 

## in 2010, compared with 36 percent in 1967. (See table 23.) 

## (Data were collected in the 1968 and 2011 Annual Social 

## and  Economic  Supplements  to  the  CPS  and  reflect  earnings 

## and work experience in the prior calendar year.) 

## In 2010, working wives contributed 38 percent of their 

## families’ incomes, up about 11 percentage points from 

## 1970, when wives’ earnings accounted for 27 percent 

## of their families’ total income. The proportion of wives 

## earning more than their husbands also has grown. In 1987, 

## 18 percent of working wives whose husbands also worked 

## earned more than their spouses; in 2010, the proportion was 

## 29 percent. (See tables 24 and 25.) (Data were collected 

## in the 1971, 1988, and 2011 Annual Social and Economic 

## Supplements  to  the  CPS  and  reflect  earnings  and  work 

## experience in the prior calendar year.) 

# Minimum wage and working poor 

## In 2011, approximately 2.4 million women who were paid 

## at an hourly rate had earnings at or below the prevailing 

## federal minimum wage. This represented 6 percent of all 

## women paid at an hourly rate. Among women 25 years and 

## older who were paid hourly rates, 4 percent had earnings at 

## or below the minimum wage, compared with 16 percent of 

## women ages 16 to 24. (See table 26.) 

## Among workers who were in the labor force for at least 

## 27 weeks in 2010, about the same number of women (5.2 

## million)  and  men  (5.3  million)  lived  below  the  official 

## poverty level. The working-poor rate (the ratio of the 

## working poor to all individuals in the labor force for at 

## least 27 weeks), however, was higher for women than for 

## men—7.6 percent, compared with 6.7 percent. Black and 

## Hispanic  women  were  significantly  more  likely  than  their 

## White or Asian counterparts to be among the working 

## poor. The working-poor rates for Black and Hispanic 

## women were 14.5 percent and 13.8 percent, respectively, 

## compared with 6.6 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively, 

## for White and Asian women. (See table 27.) (Data are 

## from the 2011 Annual Social and Economic Supplement 

## to  the  CPS  and  reflect  earnings  and  work  experience  in  the 

## prior calendar year.) 

# Worker displacement and tenure 

## From January 2009 through December 2011, 6.1 million 

## workers ages 20 and older were displaced from jobs they 

## had held for at least 3 years; women accounted for about 

## 44 percent of those displaced. Women were less likely 

## than men to have found a new job at the time of the survey 

## in January 2012: the reemployment rate for women was 

## 50 percent, compared with 61 percent for men. Among 

## displaced workers, the proportion of women who were 

## unemployed at the time of the survey in January 2012 

## was higher than for men—31 percent, compared with 23 

## percent. Women were slightly more likely than men to have 

## left the labor force, 20 percent, compared with 16 percent. 

## (See table 28.) (Data are from the January 2012 Displaced 

## Worker Supplement to the CPS.) 

## In January 2012, the median number of years that female 

## wage and salary workers had been with their employer was 

## 4.6, compared with 4.7 years for their male counterparts. 

## (See table 29.) (Data are from the January 2012 Displaced 

## Worker Supplement to the CPS.) 

# Other characteristics 

## Among 2011 high school graduates, young women were 

## more likely than young men to be enrolled in college in 

## October 2011 (72 percent, compared with 65 percent, 

## respectively). (See table 30.) (Data are from the October 

## 2011 School Enrollment Supplement to the CPS.) 

## In October 2011, 41.8 percent of women ages 16 to 24 who 

## were enrolled in either high school or college were in the labor 

## force. Young men of the same age group who were enrolled 

## in school had a lower labor force participation rate (36.2 

## percent). Among those not enrolled in school, women were 

## less likely to be in the labor force than men (74.0 percent, 

## compared with 84.8 percent). (See table 31.) (Data are from 

## the October 2011 School Enrollment Supplement to the CPS.) 

## Young women 16 to 24 years old who were not enrolled in 

## school and who did not have a high school diploma were 

## significantly  less  likely  to  participate  in  the  labor  force 4 BLS Reports  │ February 2013  • www.bls.gov W O M E N I N T H E L A B O R F O R C E : A D ATA B O O K 

## (57.0 percent) in October 2011 than those who had a high 

## school diploma but no additional education (68.4 percent). 

## Among those in the labor force, high school dropouts were 

## more likely to be unemployed (31.2 percent) than were 

## high school graduates (19.0 percent). (See table 31.) (Data 

## are from the October 2011 School Enrollment Supplement 

## to the CPS.) 

# Multiple jobholders and the self-employed 

## In 2011, 5.3 percent of employed women held more 

## than one job. The rate for men was lower, at 4.6 percent. 

## Multiple jobholding rates for women and men have edged 

## down in recent years and remain below the rates recorded 

## in the mid-1990s. (See table 32.) 

## In 2011, 5.1 percent of working women in nonagricultural 

## industries were self-employed, compared with 7.1 percent 

## for their male counterparts. In 2011, 39 percent of all self-

## employed persons were women, compared with 27 percent 

## in 1976. (See table 33.) 

# Foreign born 

## In 2011, foreign-born women were somewhat less likely 

## than native-born women to be in the labor force (54.6 

## percent, compared with 58.7 percent). Of those in the 

## labor force, foreign-born women were more likely to 

## be unemployed than their native-born counterparts (9.5 

## percent, compared with 8.3 percent). Foreign-born men 

## were more likely to be in the labor force (79.5 percent) than 

## native-born men (68.8 percent) and were somewhat less 

## likely to be unemployed (8.8 percent, compared with 9.5 

## percent). (See table 34.) 

# Union membership 

## In 2011, 11.2 percent of female wage and salary workers 

## were members of unions, compared with 12.4 percent of 

## their male counterparts. For both men and women, the 

## union membership rate in 2011 was lower than in 1983, but 

## the rate has fallen much more for men over the 1983–2011 

## period—12.3 percentage points, compared with 3.4 points 

## for women. (See table 35.) 

# Veterans 

## In 2011, there were 11.3 million veterans of the U.S. 

## Armed Forces in the labor force. Ten percent of these 

## veterans were women. Among female veterans in the labor 

## force, a little more than half (56 percent) served in the Gulf 

## War-era I and II service periods (August 1990 to present). 

## (See table 36.) 

# Women with disabilities 

## Of the 14.7 million women with disabilities in 2011, 2.6 

## million, or 17.4 percent, were in the labor force. Nearly 

## half of women with disabilities were age 65 and older; 

## labor force participation among them was 4.8 percent, 

## compared with 29.6 percent among those ages 16 to 64.

For an explanation, see the historical comparability documentation provided at 

http://www.bls.gov/cps/eetech_methods.pdf .NOTE: Beginning in 2003, estimates for the above race groups (White, Black or African American, and Asian) include people who selected this race group only; people who selected more than one race group are not included. Prior to 2003, people who reported more than one race were included in the group they identified as the main race. Data for 2000–02 are for the category Asians and Pacific Islanders. Starting in 2003, Asians constitute a separate category. For more information, see the historical comparability documentation. Data for Asians were not tabulated prior to 2000. Persons whose ethnicity is identified as Hispanic or Latino may be of any race. SOURCE: Current Population Survey, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics

## W O M E N I N T H E L A B O R F O R C E : A D ATA B O O K BLS Reports  │ February 2013  • www.bls.gov  101 

## The estimates in this report were obtained from the Current 

## Population Survey (CPS), a national monthly sample 

## survey of approximately 60,000 eligible households that 

## provides a wide range of information on the labor force, 

## employment, and unemployment. The survey is conducted 

## for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) by the U.S. 

## Census  Bureau,  using  a scientifically  selected  national 

## sample with coverage in all 50 states and the District of 

## Columbia. 

## Material in this report is in the public domain and, with 

## appropriate credit, may be reproduced without permission. 

## This information is available to sensory-impaired 

## individuals upon request. Voice phone: (202) 691-5200; 

## Federal Relay Service: (800) 877-8339. 

# Concepts  and  definitions 

## Civilian noninstitutional population.  Included are persons 

## 16 years of age and older residing in the 50 States and the 

## District  of  Columbia  who  are  not  confined  to  institutions 

## (for example, correctional facilities, residential nursing, 

## and mental health care facilities) and who are not on active 

## duty in the Armed Forces. 

## Civilian labor force.  This group comprises all persons 

## classified  as  employed  or  unemployed. 

## Civilian labor force participation rate.  This rate is 

## the civilian labor force as a percent of the civilian 

## noninstitutional population. 

## Employed persons.  All persons who, during the survey 

## reference week, (a) did any work at all (at least 1 hour) as 

## paid employees; worked in their own business, profession, 

## or on their own farm; or worked 15 hours or more as 

## unpaid workers in an enterprise operated by a member of 

## the family; and (b) all those who were not working but who 

## had jobs or businesses from which they were temporarily 

## absent because of vacation, illness, bad weather, childcare 

## problems, maternity or paternity leave, labor-management 

## disputes, job training, or other family or personal reasons, 

## whether or not they were paid for the time off or were 

## seeking other jobs. 

## Employment-population ratio.  This ratio represents the 

## proportion of the population that is employed. 

## Unemployed persons.  All persons who had no employment 

## during the survey reference week, were available for work 

## (except  for  temporary  illness),  and  had  made  specific 

## efforts  to  find  employment  sometime  during  the  4-week 

## period ending with the survey reference week. Persons 

## who were waiting to be recalled to a job from which they 

## had been laid off did not need to be looking for work to be 

## classified  as  unemployed. 

## Unemployment rate.  This rate represents the number of 

## unemployed persons as a percent of the civilian labor force. 

## Not in the labor force.  Included in this group are all persons 

## in the civilian noninstitutional population who are neither 

## employed nor unemployed. Persons marginally attached to 

## the labor force are those individuals not in the labor force 

## who wanted and were available for work and had looked 

## for a job sometime in the prior 12 months (or since the end 

## of their last job if they held one within the past 12 months). 

## They were not counted as unemployed because they had 

## not searched for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. 

## Discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached, 

## were not looking for work because they believed no jobs 

## were available for them. 

## Race.  In  accordance  with  the  Office  of  Management  and 

## Budget guidelines, White, Black or African American, 

## and Asian are terms used to describe a person’s race. 

## Beginning in 2003, persons in these categories are those 

## who selected that race group only. Those who identify 

## multiple race groups are categorized as persons of two or 

## more  races.  (Previously,  persons  identified  a group  as  their 

## main race.) In the enumeration process, race is determined 

## by the household respondent. More information on the 

## 2003 changes to questions on race and Hispanic ethnicity is 

## available at  http://www.bls.gov/cps/rvcps03.pdf .

## Hispanic or Latino ethnicity.  This refers to persons who 

## identified  themselves  in  the  enumeration  process  as  being 10 2 BLS Reports  │ February 2013  • www.bls.gov W O M E N I N T H E L A B O R F O R C E : A D ATA B O O K 

## Spanish, Hispanic, or Latino. Persons whose ethnicity is 

## identified  as  Hispanic  or  Latino  may  be  of  any  race.  More 

## information on the 2003 changes in questions on race and 

## Hispanic ethnicity is available at  http://www.bls.gov/cps/ 

## rvcps03.pdf .

## Family.  A family  is  defined  as  a group  of  two  or  more 

## persons residing together who are related by birth, marriage, 

## or adoption; all such persons are considered as members of 

## one  family.  Families  are  classified  either  as  married-couple 

## families or as families maintained by women or men without 

## spouses present. Families include those without children as 

## well as those with children under 18 in the home. 

## Children.  Data on children refer to one’s own children and 

## include sons, daughters, stepchildren, and adopted children. 

## Not included are nieces, nephews, grandchildren, other 

## related children, and all unrelated children living in the 

## household. 

## Self-employed workers.  Self-employed workers are 

## those  who  work  for  profit  or  fees  in  their  own  business, 

## profession, trade, or farm. Unincorporated self-employed 

## workers are included in the self-employed category. Self-

## employed persons whose businesses are incorporated are 

## included with wage and salary workers. 

## Wage and salary workers.  These are workers who receive 

## wages, salaries, commissions, tips, payment in kind, or 

## piece rates. The group includes employees in both the 

## private and public sectors. Data on union membership and 

## earnings of wage and salary workers exclude all self-

## employed workers, both those with incorporated businesses 

## and those with unincorporated businesses. 

## Workers paid by the hour.  Persons paid at an hourly rate on 

## their main job. Historically, workers paid an hourly wage 

## have  made  up  approximately  three-fifths  of  all  wage  and 

## salary workers. 

## Usual weekly earnings.  Data represent earnings before 

## taxes and other deductions, and include any overtime pay, 

## commissions, or tips usually received (at the main job, in 

## the case of multiple jobholders). Earnings reported on a 

## basis other than weekly (for example, annual, monthly, or 

## hourly) are converted to weekly. The term “usual” is as 

## perceived by the respondent. If the respondent asks for a 

## definition  of  usual,  interviewers  are  instructed  to  define  the 

## term as more than half the weeks worked during the past 4 

## or 5 months. Data refer to the sole or primary job of wage 

## and salary workers (excluding all self-employed persons 

## regardless of whether their businesses were incorporated). 

## The data are tabulated from one-quarter of the CPS monthly 

## sample and are limited to wage and salary workers. 

## Median earnings.  These  figures  indicate  the  value  that 

## divides the earnings distribution into two equal parts, one 

## part having values above the median and the other having 

## values below the median. The medians shown in this 

## publication are calculated by linear interpolation of the 

## $50-centered interval within which each median falls. 

## Hours at work.  These are the actual hours worked (at all 

## jobs) during the survey reference week. For example, 

## persons who normally work 40 hours a week but were off 

## during the Columbus Day holiday would be reported as 

## working 32 hours, even if they were paid for the holiday. 

## Usual hours, or usual full- or part-time status.  Data on 

## persons “at work” exclude persons who were temporarily 

## absent  from  a job  and  therefore  classified  in  the  zero-hours 

## worked category, “with a job but not at work.” These are 

## persons who were absent from their jobs for the entire 

## week for reasons such as bad weather, vacation, illness, or 

## involvement in a labor dispute. To differentiate a person’s 

## normal schedule from his or her activity during the survey 

## reference  week,  persons  also  are  classified  according  to 

## their usual full- or part-time status. In this context, full-time 

## workers are those who usually work 35 hours or more (at 

## all jobs combined) per week. This group includes some 

## individuals who worked less than 35 hours in the reference 

## week for either economic or noneconomic reasons and 

## those who were temporarily absent from work. Similarly, 

## part-time workers are those who usually work less than 

## 35 hours per week (at all jobs), regardless of the number 

## of hours worked in the reference week. This may include 

## some individuals who actually worked more than 34 

## hours in the reference week, as well as those who were 

## temporarily absent from work. BLS Reports  │ February 2013  • www.bls.gov  10 3W O M E N I N T H E L A B O R F O R C E : A D ATA B O O K 

## Occupation and industry.  This information applies to the job 

## held during the reference week. Persons with two or more 

## jobs  are  classified  in  the  occupation  and  industry  at  which 

## they worked the greatest number of hours. CPS data use 

## the  Census  occupational  classification,  based  on  the  2010 

## Standard  Occupation  Classification  (SOC),  and  the  Census 

## industry  classification,  derived  from  the  2007  North  American 

## Industry  Classification  System  (NAICS).  Additional 

## information  about  these  classifications  is  available  online  at 

## http://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsoccind.htm .

## Work experience.  These  data  reflect  work  activity  during 

## the calendar year and are obtained from the Annual 

## Social and Economic Supplement (ASEC) to the CPS. 

## Estimates of persons who worked were based on “yes” 

## responses to the following questions in the ASEC: “Did 

## you work at a job or business at any time during [the 

## survey reference year]?” or “Did you do any temporary, 

## part-time, or seasonal work even for a few days during 

## [the survey reference year]?” Since the reference period is 

## a full year, the number of persons with some employment 

## or unemployment greatly exceeds the average levels for 

## any given month, which are based on a 1-week reference 

## period, and the corresponding annual averages of monthly 

## estimates. 

## Workers paid at or below the Federal minimum wage. 

## The estimates of the numbers of workers with reported 

## earnings at or below the federal minimum wage pertain 

## only to workers who are paid hourly rates. Salaried 

## workers and other workers who are not paid by the hour 

## are not included, even though some have earnings that, 

## if converted to hourly rates, would be at or below the 

## minimum wage. Research has shown, however, that the 

## degree of understatement is small. BLS does not routinely 

## estimate the hourly earnings of workers not paid by the 

## hour because of data quality concerns associated with such 

## an estimation process. 

## The presence of workers with hourly earnings below the 

## minimum wage does not necessarily indicate violations of 

## the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), because there are a 

## number of exemptions to the minimum-wage provisions 

## of the law. In addition, some workers might have rounded 

## their hourly earnings in response to survey questions. As 

## a result, some might have reported hourly earnings below 

## the minimum wage when, in fact, they earned the minimum 

## wage or higher. 

## Poverty classification.  Poverty statistics presented in 

## this  report  are  based  on  definitions  developed  by  the 

## Social Security Administration in 1964 and revised by 

## Federal interagency committees in 1969 and 1981. These 

## definitions  originally  were  based  on  the  Department 

## of  Agriculture’s  Economy  Food  Plan  and  reflected  the 

## different consumption requirements of families based on 

## factors such as family size and the number of children 

## under 18 years of age. The actual poverty thresholds vary 

## in accordance with the makeup of the family. Poverty 

## thresholds  are  updated  each  year  to  reflect  changes  in  the 

## Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). 

## The thresholds do not vary geographically. For more 

## information on poverty data and thresholds, see  http:// 

## www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/poverty.html .

## Displaced workers.  Displaced workers are wage and 

## salary workers 20 years of age and older who lost or left 

## jobs because their plant or company closed or moved, 

## there  was  insufficient  work  for  them  to  do,  or  their 

## position or shift was abolished. Data are often presented 

## for long-tenured displaced workers—those who had 

## worked for their employer for 3 or more years at the 

## time of displacement. All self-employed workers are 

## excluded, both those with incorporated businesses and 

## those with unincorporated businesses. Data are collected 

## through a supplement to the January Current Population 

## Survey (CPS). 

## Employee tenure.  This is a measure of how long wage 

## and salary workers had been with their current employer 

## at the time of the survey. Tenure is presented in median 

## years; the median is the point at which half of all workers 

## had more tenure and half had less tenure. Data refer to 

## the sole or principal job of full- and part-time workers. 

## All self-employed workers are excluded, both those with 

## incorporated businesses and those with unincorporated 

## businesses. The data are collected through a supplement to 

## the January Current Population Survey (CPS). 10 4 BLS Reports  │ February 2013  • www.bls.gov W O M E N I N T H E L A B O R F O R C E : A D ATA B O O K 

## Foreign born.  The foreign born are persons residing in 

## the United States who were not U.S. citizens at birth. That 

## is, they were born outside the United States or one of its 

## outlying areas such as Puerto Rico or Guam, to parents 

## neither of whom was a U.S. citizen. The foreign-born 

## population includes legally-admitted immigrants, refugees, 

## temporary residents such as students and temporary 

## workers, and undocumented immigrants. The survey data, 

## however, do not separately identify the number of persons 

## in these categories. The native born are persons born in the 

## United States or one of its outlying areas such as Puerto 

## Rico or Guam or who were born abroad of at least one 

## parent who was a U.S. citizen. 

## Union membership.  Union membership refers to members 

## of a labor union or an employee association similar 

## to a union. The data are tabulated from one-quarter of 

## the CPS monthly sample and are limited to wage and 

## salary workers. All self-employed workers are excluded, 

## both those with incorporated businesses and those with 

## unincorporated businesses. 

## Veterans.  Veterans are men and women 18 years or older 

## who previously served on active duty in the U.S. Armed 

## Forces and who were civilians at the time they were 

## surveyed. Members of the Reserve and National Guard 

## are counted as veterans if they had ever been called to 

## active duty. Persons who are on active duty at the time 

## of the survey are outside the scope of the survey and 

## thus not in the estimates shown here, as are persons who 

## reside in institutions, such as nursing homes and prisons. 

## Nonveterans are men and women who never served on 

## active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces. Veteran status is 

## obtained from responses to the question, “Did you ever 

## serve on active duty in the U.S. Armed Forces?” 

## Disability.  The CPS uses a set of six questions to identify 

## persons with disabilities. The questions inquire about 

## physical, mental, or emotional conditions that cause 

## serious  difficulty  with  daily  activities.  Persons  are 

## classified  as  having  a disability  if  there  is  a response  of 

## “yes” to any of these questions. Each of the questions ask 

## the respondent whether anyone in the household has the 

## condition described, and if the respondent replies “yes,” 

## they are then asked to identify everyone in the household 

## who has the condition. More information, including the 

## wording of the six questions used to identify persons 

## with a disability, is available at  http://www.bls.gov/cps/ 

## demographics.htm#disability .

# Reliability of the estimates 

## Statistics based on the CPS are subject to both sampling 

## and nonsampling error. When a sample, rather than an 

## entire population, is surveyed, there is a chance that the 

## sample estimates may differ from the true population 

## values they represent. The component of this difference 

## that occurs because samples differ by chance is known 

## as sampling error, and its variability is measured by the 

## standard error of the estimate. There is about a 90-percent 

## chance,  or  level  of  confidence,  that  an  estimate  based  on  a

## sample will differ by no more than 1.6 standard errors from 

## the true population value because of sampling error. BLS 

## analyses are generally conducted at the 90-percent level of 

## confidence. 

## All other types of error are referred to as nonsampling 

## error. Nonsampling error can occur for many reasons, 

## including the failure to sample a segment of the population, 

## inability to obtain information for all respondents in 

## the sample, inability or unwillingness of respondents 

## to provide correct information, and errors made in the 

## collection or processing of data. 

## More information on the reliability of data from the CPS and 

## estimating standard errors is available at  http://www.bls.gov/
