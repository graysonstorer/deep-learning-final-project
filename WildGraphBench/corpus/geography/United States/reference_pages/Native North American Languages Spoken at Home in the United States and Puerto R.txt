INTRODUCTION 

This report presents data on the 

frequency and percentage of the 

U.S. population aged 5 and over who 

spoke a Native North American lan -

guage at home. 1 The data are based on 

5-year estimates from the 2006–2010 

American Community Survey (ACS) and 

the 2006–2010 Puerto Rico Community 

Survey. For the first time ever, this 

aggregation of ACS data over a 5-year 

period allows us to study small segments 

of the population, such as speakers of 

Native North American languages. 

These data come from a multipart ques -

tion addressing language ability. The 

first part of the question asks “Does 

this person speak a language other than 

English at home?” Respondents who 

answer “Yes” are then asked to write 

in the name of that language. Data on 

language ability is used to meet the com -

munication needs of hospitals, schools, 

and other agencies that serve non-English 

speakers. In addition, language use 

data are used for bilingual ballot provi -

sions of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. 

Respondents are also asked to report 

the one or more race groups they 

consider themselves to be. Part of 

this report focuses on people who 

identify themselves as American 

Indian or Alaska Native alone or in 

combination with other races.

For the purposes of this brief, “Native North 

American languages” does not include languages 

native to Hawaii, Central America, or South America.

languages in the United States, go to

NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN 

LANGUAGES SPOKEN 

The ACS codes 381 distinct non-English 

languages, and 169 of these are Native 

North American languages. Although 

Native North American languages make 

up most of the languages coded, the 

speakers of these languages number 

less than half a million. The size of 

the Native North American language 

speaking population is dwarfed by the 

60 million people speaking a different 

non-English language and the 227 mil -

lion people who speak English only. 

What Is the American Community 

Survey? 

The American Community Survey (ACS) 

is a nationwide survey designed to 

provide communities with reliable and 

timely demographic, social, economic, 

and housing data for the nation, states, 

congressional districts, counties, places, 

and other localities every year. It has an 

annual sample size of about 3 million 

addresses across the United States and 

Puerto Rico and includes both housing 

units and group quarters (e.g., nursing 

facilities and prisons). The ACS is con -

ducted in every county throughout the 

nation, and every municipio in Puerto 

Rico, where it is called the Puerto Rico 

Community Survey. Beginning in 2006, 

ACS data for 2005 were released for 

geographic areas with populations of 

65,000 and greater. For information on 

the ACS sample design and other topics,

Table 1 shows the number of 

people aged 5 and over who spoke 

a Native North American lan -

guage for the 20 most frequently 

spoken of these languages in the 

United States and Puerto Rico. The 

table also separates out Native 

North American language speak -

ers that reside in an American 

Indian or Alaska Native area 

(AIANA). 2 Native North American 

language speakers number 

372,000. Most of these speak -

ers (237,000) live in an AIANA. 

People spoke Navajo more often 

than any other Native North 

American language. Over 169,000

people spoke this language nation -

ally. Most of these Navajo speak -

ers (112,000) lived in an AIANA. 

Navajo speakers numbered nearly 

9 times larger than the second 

and third most commonly spoken 

languages of Yupik and Dakota, 

with both languages having 

approximately 19,000 speak -

ers. While 84.5 percent of Yupik 

speakers lived in an AIANA, 51.5 

percent of Dakota speakers did. 

Although the majority of Native 

North American language speakers 

resided in an AIANA, only a small 

percentage of the people living 

in these areas actually spoke a 

Native North American language. 

Table 2 shows the percentage of 

people living in these areas who 

spoke a Native North American 

language, English only, or some 

other language, by age. Of people 

living in an AIANA, 5.4 percent 

spoke a Native North American 

language, and this percentage 

did not vary greatly across age 

groups. 3 Spanish was the dominant 

language among the population 

speaking a non-English and non-

Native North American language. 

In fact, Spanish speakers made 

up 5 percent of the population 

living in an AIANA, making them 

almost as common as speakers of 

Native North American languages. 

Among those who identified as 

American Indian or Alaska Native 

alone, older people reported 

speaking a Native North American 

language more often than younger 

people (Table 3). Over 1 in 5 of 

these people aged 65 and over 

spoke such a language, while about 

1 in 10 people aged 5 to 17 did 

so. Among those who identified as 

American Indian or Alaska Native 

in combination, people aged 65 

and over were slightly less likely 

than other people to speak a 

Native North American language,

groups were not significantly

NATIVE NORTH AMERICAN 

LANGUAGE USE BY COUNTY 

Figure 1 displays the number of 

Native North American language 

speakers by county. Speakers of 

Native North American languages 

concentrated most heavily in the 

states of Alaska, Arizona, and 

New Mexico. Sixty-five percent of 

Native North American language 

speakers lived in these three 

states. Just nine counties within 

these states contained half of the 

nation’s Native North American 

language speakers. 4 Apache County 

in Arizona had 37,000 speak -

ers of a Native North American 

language, making it the highest

in the nation. McKinley County, 

New Mexico, had the second most 

speakers, 33,000. Together, about 

20 percent of all Native North 

American language speakers in the 

nation lived in these two counties.
