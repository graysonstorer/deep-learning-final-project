Rising over 14,000 feet into the sky, the Rocky Mountain Range stretches between the United States and Canada. The mountain range, which holds the Continental Divide, draws guests from around the world who wish to climb its peaks, study its wildlife or take in its views. National parks in both the US and Canada protect the area so that guests can continue to appreciate its grandeur

Topography
----------

While the Rocky Mountains sit high above sea level, hitting the 14,000-foot range in most areas, the mountains themselves are not particularly high since they rise from areas already at 4,000 to 8,000 feet above sea level. Mount Elbert near Leadville, [Colorado](https://traveltips.usatoday.com/colorado/), has an elevation of 14,433 feet, making it the tallest peak in the mountain range. The popular Pikes Peak, the second most visited peak in the world, is only the 31st highest, rising 14,110 feet above sea level. Peak Bagger indicates that the Rockies are fairly gentle and require little technical mountaineering to climb, with the summit of Mount Elbert reachable by bicycle.

Animal Life
-----------

Because the Rocky Mountain Range covers such a vast geographical area, the animals found in the mountains vary from location to location. The National Park Service indicates that Rocky Mountain National Park serves as the habitat to 66 mammal species, including the rare lynx and wolverine. Above the tree line, small pikas live in the rocky crevices of the mountains. Black bears, coyotes, elk, marmots, mountain lions, bighorn sheep and moose also live in Rocky Mountain National Park. Banff National Park in Canada has numerous bighorn sheep as well as hoary marmots, grizzly and black bears and the golden-mantled ground squirrel, among other creatures.

Length
------

The Rocky Mountain Range actually represents a series of more than 100 separate mountain ranges, rather than one uninterrupted mountain chain. These ranges stretch through New Mexico, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado, and also extend into British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. The entire series of mountain ranges measures approximately 3,000 miles.

Boundaries
----------

The southern edge of the range sits in central New Mexico, with the Liard River in Canada serving as the northern boundary. On the east, I-25 serves as the boundary in the US. The Rocky Mountain Trench serves as the western edge in Canada. The western edge in the United States is not well defined, as the mountains gradually merge into the Great Basin desert regions.

National Parks
--------------

Because of the vast expanse covered by the Rocky Mountain Range, it holds several national parks. On the Canadian side, Banff, Kootenay, Yoho and Jasper National Parks protect the landscape and wildlife of the Rocky Mountains. Canada also has three provincial parks, Mount Robson, Mount Assiniboine and Hamber, along the Rockies. On the US side, the Rocky Mountain National Park, Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park, Glacier National Park and the Royal Gorge Park, among others, all give guests the opportunity to [explore](https://traveltips.usatoday.com/times-year-hiking-colorado-60316.html) the Rockies.

Situated in southeastern Europe, Romania is about the size of Oregon, making it Europe's 12th-largest country. Romania's terrain is divided almost equally between rolling plains, hilly plateaus and towering mountains. Europe's longest river, the Danube, runs along its southern border, frequented by transcontinental cruise vessels. On Romania's eastern edge, the sunny shores of the Black Sea draw throngs of beachgoers each summer. And no matter the time of year, the nation's mountain ranges are a paradise for outdoor enthusiasts.

Carpathian Mountains
--------------------

The 900-mile-long Carpathian Mountains extend from Poland and Slovakia through Ukraine and down into Romania. The range runs in a northwest-to-southeast direction, entering Romania at its northwestern border with Ukraine and stretching into the heart of the country. The Carpathians divide Romania's central basin in the west from the Moldavian Plateau in the east. Geologically, the Carpathians are a relatively young range, and technically a continuation of the Alps of central Europe.

Transylvanian Alps
------------------

In the middle of Romania, the Carpathians turn abruptly eastward at a 90-degree angle. Here they become known as the Transylvanian Alps, sometimes called the Carpatii Mountains or southern Carpathians. The Transylvanian Alps extend in a horizontal line across the eastern two-thirds of the country to the Serbian border. To their north lies the country's central basin, and to their south, the Walachian Plain of the Danube River. Overall, the Transylvanian Alps are a higher range than the Carpathians, and Romania's highest peak, Mount Moldoveanu, rises to 8,346 feet in this mountain chain. Like the Carpathians, the Transylvanian Alps are also a continuation of the Central European Alps.

Transylvanian Basin
-------------------

The Transylvanian Basin is tucked in the western portion of the country in between the two major mountain ranges. However, the title of this region is somewhat of a misnomer. Although the Transylvanian Basin sits at a lower altitude than the encircling mountains, its elevation averages 1,150 feet above sea level. This relative lowland is broken only by the isolated Apuseni Mountains, a small, circular group of uplands.

Moldavian Plateau
-----------------

Between Romania's Carpathian Mountains and its Black Sea shores lies the Moldavian Plateau. As its name implies, it extends through Moldova and into Ukraine. It slopes gently downward toward the southeast, with elevations averaging between 1,600 and 2,000 feet.

Walachian Plain
---------------

The Walachian Plain extends from the Transylvanian Alps southward to the Danube River and on into Bulgaria. Its eastern edge includes the Danube Delta, where the river splinters into three branches, forming a vast swampy area that attracts rare birds and other wildlife.
