That the phrase no longer appears ironic suggests how much our understanding of “imperialism” has changed.

LaFeber similarly downplays the related debates over colonies after 1898, terming these a disagreement over “tactical means” to achieve the universally shared goal of overseas markets (416); Williams, _The Tragedy of American Diplomacy_, 49, takes the same position, arguing that debates over imperialism was a “tactical disagreement” among policymakers committed to greater market access.

While Trubowitz treats tariffs much as historians have done, his interpretation diverges from them in other respects. He rightly points out that reciprocity did not work the same way in the 1890s as it has since World War II (p. 77). He also provides a more robust account of regional differences over the value of European and Asian markets, though he links these to exports rather than trade protection (pp. 52–75).

Some in the audience disputed this premise, but mainly to argue that the United States needed to act more aggressively to prevent it.

108. Adams's “The New Struggle for Life among Nations” is a good example of his thinking. (Adams, _America's Economic Supremacy_, 26–53.) Writing about the past, Mahan's tone was less apocalyptic. Nevertheless, he also viewed military competition for control of trade as a constant feature of human affairs. Mahan's _The Influence of Sea Power upon History_ opens with the following observation about the benefits of seaborne commerce: “To secure one's own people a disproportionate share of such benefits, every effort was made to exclude others, either by the peaceful legislative methods of monopoly or prohibitory regulations, or when these failed, by direct violence” (Mahan, _The Influence of Sea Power upon History_, 1).

114. Perhaps because they tended to take American security concerns less seriously, foreign observers had long viewed the Monroe Doctrine as an effort to gain commercial control of the Western Hemisphere. The London _Economist_ remarked on American efforts to establish “the Monroe doctrine in commerce for the whole Western Hemisphere” in 1886 (“The Hide and Leather Industries,” _The Economist_, April 10, 1886, 6). The _Literary Digest_ summarized the comments of an Austrian legislator along the same lines in 1892: “The American policy is that of a Great Power. Washington said to his countrymen: Take no part in European quarrels. Monroe came and said: No European state shall in the future found a new empire on this continent. Garfield and Blaine have gone a step beyond and said: The United States will extend its wings over the whole American continent, North and South, and will form a ‘_Zollverein_’ of the free countries of America.” (“The Commercial Policy of the World,” _Literary Digest_, April 16, 1892, 647.)

123. There is little evidence that this assumption changed until well after the outbreak of World War I. American leaders initially regarded the war in Europe with rather detached concern. Unlike most American diplomats, the U.S. consul in Budapest decided that the crisis of July 1914 was at least important enough to write about to Washington. However, he sent his message by regular mail out to avoid the cost of a cable transmission. It arrived on July 27, the day before the war began (West, _The Department of State on the Eve of the First World War_, 1).

126. Lodge, “England, Venezuela, and the Monroe Doctrine,” 651. Others writing on the Monroe Doctrine after the Venezuelan Crisis of 1895 took much the same position, arguing that it ruled out American intervention in Europe.

128. Then as now, scholars like Sherwood could write what they liked, but questioning the Monroe Doctrine was dangerous for political leaders. For example, in 1906, Professor John W. Burgess gave a lecture in Germany arguing that both the Monroe Doctrine and the protective tariff were “almost obsolete.” Burgess was a professor at Columbia University where he had founded _Political Science Quarterly_, and was then acting as Theodore Roosevelt Professor of American History and Institutions at the University of Berlin. His statements were widely attacked by American editorialists who mistakenly interpreted them as official policy because of Burgess's title. The administration quickly distanced itself from these comments, which reportedly caused the President so much irritation that “it probably could not be expressed in polite language.” (“A ‘Roosevelt Professor's’ Repudiation of the Monroe Doctrine,” _Literary Digest_, November 10, 1906.)
