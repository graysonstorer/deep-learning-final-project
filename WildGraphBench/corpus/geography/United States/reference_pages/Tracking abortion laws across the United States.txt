The US supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade may have abolished the national right to [abortion](https://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion), but the state-by-state battle for abortion rights is far from over.

Since [Roe was overturned in 2022](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jun/24/roe-v-wade-overturned-abortion-summary-supreme-court), 1**3** states have enacted near-total abortion bans, while four states – [Georgia](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/oct/24/georgia-abortion-ban-supreme-court), [South Carolina](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/23/south-carolina-supreme-court-abortion-ban), [Florida](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/may/01/florida-six-week-abortion-ban-takes-effect)and Iowa– have banned abortion past roughly six weeks of pregnancy. Other states have enacted laws or held ballot referendums to protect abortion rights.

*   Ban blocked
*   Disputed

In a handful of other states, the future of abortion is in flux due to legal challenges. In May 2025, for instance, the Missouri state supreme court effectively reinstated the state’s abortion ban by vacating lower-court orders that had allowed abortion providers to offer the procedure.

Missouri is one of 10 states that held votes on abortion-related [ballot measures](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2024/nov/05/abortion-ballot-results-tracker-ban-states) during the November 2024 elections, with seven of them approving amendments to either overturn bans or enshrine existing rights.

All of this tumult has led to a deeply uneven abortion landscape, with access to abortion clinics cut off across much of the south and midwest but standing strong on both coasts. The map below shows where state abortion laws stand as of 24 November2025.

These states could see their approach to abortion change soon, either because a ban that is blocked by the courts could be unblocked, or because experts are torn over whether a ban is, in fact, in effect.

### Missouri

Abortion is **Disputed**after conception

**1.4m** women of reproductive age

In November 2024, Missouri voted to established a constitutional right to abortion until viability. That vote led a judge to deem the state's near-total abortion bans unenforceable, but the bans were effectively reinstated after the state supreme court vacated the judge's orders.

### Wisconsin

Abortion is **Disputed**, the current limit is until 22 weeks

**1.3m** women of reproductive age

### Wyoming

**An abortion ban is blocked**, the current limit is until fetal viability

**122k** women of reproductive age

Two abortion bans are currently blocked from taking effect. Abortion rights supporters argue that the state constitution protects abortion rights, but the state supreme court has not ruled on the matter.

The states below ban abortion from conception or after six weeks. They all allow for abortions in cases of medical emergencies, but that language can shift by state. For example, while some states say abortions are permitted to protect someone's "health", other states only allow them if someone's "life" is threatened. Many abortion providers have said that many exceptions for medical emergencies are unworkable in practice, because the language is too vague or doesn't recognize the complexity of medicine.
