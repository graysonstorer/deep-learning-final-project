CIA History

A Legacy of Excellence and Innovation
-------------------------------------

#### **1946: The Start of Something Big**

> _“With your help and the determination to make this school of ours the culinary center of the nation, I think we have the answer I looked for at the start: America—the best meals on earth.”—Frances Roth, at the National Restaurant Convention in 1950_

Connecticut-based attorney Frances Roth may have never worked in a restaurant, but she was one of the most influential pioneers in culinary education. From her perspective on the industry, she was determined to establish a school that would become “the culinary center of the nation.” With support from co-founder Katharine Angell, who was married to then-Yale University President James Rowland Angell, Mrs. Roth turned her passion into a new vision for educating chefs.

On**May 22, 1946,**the New Haven Restaurant Institute opened its doors in downtown New Haven, CT, as the first and only school of its kind in the United States. Specifically created to train returning World War II veterans in the culinary arts, the Institute enrolled 50 students and employed a faculty consisting of a chef, a baker, and a dietitian.

#### **1946–1970: Growing Up in New Haven**

The early years of the Institute are marked by continual growth and accomplishment

**1947:**The school changed its name to the Restaurant Institute of Connecticut.

**1950:**Just four years after its opening, 600 veterans from 38 states had already graduated from the Institute.

> _“For Americans who dine out regularly, this chef’s training program promises a continuity of good eating—with increasing accent on the ‘American’ tastes.”—_ Look _magazine, 1950_

**1951:**The school changes its name one final time, to the Culinary Institute of America, reflecting its national scope and the increasing diversity of the campus population.

**1960:**In a nod to an ongoing need by food professionals for more training, continuing education is introduced into the curricula.

**1965:**After nearly 20 years of service to the college, Frances Roth retires, and Jacob Rosenthal is named president. Meanwhile, CIA’s enrollment increases to 400 students.

**1969:**Double-class sessions are initiated to accommodate a backlog of applications and an auxiliary campus is leased. But with more than 1,000 students and facilities strained to the maximum, it’s becoming clear CIA needs a new home…and a new era is about to begin.

#### The 1970s: New Home, More Quality Education

With its move to the beautiful Hudson Valley in New York, CIA is well-positioned to advance its reputation for excellence in culinary education and meet national—and international—demand for its services.

**1970:** After an exhaustive search in which sites as far as Chicago, Atlanta, and Columbia, MD are considered, CIA purchases the St. Andrew-on-Hudson Jesuit novitiate in Hyde Park, NY for its new campus.

> _“(St. Andrew-on-Hudson) lends itself to the creation of ideal facilities and an ideal educational environment.”—Jacob Rosenthal, CIA president_

**1971:** The Board of Regents of the State of New York grants CIA a charter to confer an Associate in Occupational Studies degree, making it the first culinary college to be so authorized.

**1972:** CIA opens the doors to its beautiful new riverside [campus in Hyde Park, NY](https://www.ciachef.edu/cia-new-york/), with its main building named Roth Hall.

#### ****The 1980s: Leading the Profession****

With new leadership, facility expansion, and curriculum innovation, CIA is at the forefront of preparing students to succeed in one of the hottest industries on the planet.

**1980–1981:**The decade starts off in masterful fashion for the Culinary Institute of America—Master Chef Ferdinand E. Metz is named the college’s next president, and CIA becomes the only school authorized to administer the American Culinary Federation’s exam for Master Chefs, the highest professional certification in the country.

**1982–1984:**Three additional student-staffed restaurants make their debut on the New York campus in a three-year span: the American Bounty Restaurant, one of the first in the nation devoted to American cuisine; the Ristorante Caterina de’ Medici, specializing in Italian cuisine; and St. Andrew’s Café, originally geared toward nutritional cooking.

> _“The American Bounty represents more than just another restaurant, especially since its successful implementation again places the Institute at the forefront of culinary education.”—Ferdinand E. Metz, CIA president_

> _“Whatever furthers the feeling of what we have, what we grew up with, and what we hope to have, is very precious, very dear to my heart.”\_—\_ James Beard, speaking about the American Bounty Restaurant at its 1982 opening_

New bachelor’s degree programs and a West Coast presence highlight one of the most significant periods in the college’s history.

**1990:**Responding to a growing industry need for highly qualified, professionally trained baking and pastry chefs, the college opens its new baking and pastry facility. Two years later, the center is dedicated as the Shunsuke Takaki School of Baking and Pastry to honor the founder of Japan’s Takaki Bakery and Andersen Group.

**1993:**CIA completes its transformation into a complete college of higher education when the New York State Board of Regents approves the Institute to offer two [Bachelor of Professional Studies (BPS) degrees](https://www.ciachef.edu/programs/?_program_level=bachelors), in either Culinary Arts Management or Baking and Pastry Arts Management. Later that same year, in keeping with the spirit of education growth, CIA opens the Conrad N. Hilton Library.

CIA at Greystone holds the first Worlds of Flavor® International Conference and Festival, its flagship conference that each year transforms the Napa Valley campus into a crossroads of world food and culture.
