COLLECTED BY

 Organization: [Archive Team](https://archive.org/details/archiveteam)

![Image 4: The image shows an archive team going to rescue your shit, and contains two plastic crates filled with old CD-ROMs, as well as a cabinet of old-fashioned cassette tapes](http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg) Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history. 
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.

The main site for Archive Team is at [archiveteam.org](http://www.archiveteam.org/) and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.

This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the [Wayback Machine](http://archive.org/web/web.php), providing a path back to lost websites and work.

Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

**The Archive Team Panic Downloads** are full pulldowns of currently extant websites, meant to serve as emergency backups for needed sites that are in danger of closing, or which will be missed dearly if suddenly lost due to hard drive crashes or server failures.

Collection: [ArchiveBot: The Archive Team Crowdsourced Crawler](https://archive.org/details/archivebot)

 ArchiveBot is an IRC bot designed to automate the archival of smaller websites (e.g. up to a few hundred thousand URLs). You give it a URL to start at, and it grabs all content under that URL, records it in a WARC, and then uploads that WARC to ArchiveTeam servers for eventual injection into the Internet Archive (or other archive sites). 
To use ArchiveBot, drop by #archivebot on EFNet. To interact with ArchiveBot, you issue commands by typing it into the channel. Note you will need channel operator permissions in order to issue archiving jobs. The dashboard shows the sites being downloaded currently.

There is a dashboard running for the archivebot process at [http://www.archivebot.com](http://www.archivebot.com/).

ArchiveBot's source code can be found at [https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot](https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot).

The US has around 800 military bases in other countries, which costs an estimated $100 billion annually, a number that could be much higher depending on whether you count the bases still open in Iraq and Afghanistan. This is according to American University professor David Vine in [his forthcoming book _Base Nation_](https://web.archive.org/web/20200924114313/http://us.macmillan.com/basenation/davidvine), in which he seeks to quantify the financial, environmental, and human costs of keeping these bases open.

Bases around the world.

The word "base" is a broad term that captures all sorts of military posts, stations, camps, forts, etc. around the globe. The Pentagon specifics that a "base site" is any geographic location that is "owned by or leased to, or otherwise possessed" by the military.

Most of these bases cropped up after World War II when the US took position as the global leader and peacekeeper in and around Japan and Germany. The Korean and Cold Wars sped up the expansion of US military infrastructure to other countries. Containing Soviet communism led the US to set up posts all over the globe to ensure a geopolitical foothold in places that were vulnerable to Soviet influence — which basically meant everywhere.

Even though Japan, Germany, and Korea are now American allies and stable democracies, thousands of troops and many bases still remain in these countries. Even though the Cold War is over, much of the military infrastructure built up in response to that era remains operational.

American taxpayers are in charge of the bill for keeping these bases running. This estimated $100 billion is pumped out of our economy to the location of these bases. It's a massive military system that ensures US influence in every corner of the planet, and given the uncontested nature of this widespread strategy, there isn't likely to be any change soon.
