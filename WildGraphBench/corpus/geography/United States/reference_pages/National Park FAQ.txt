National Park System
====================

On August 25, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed the "Organic Act" creating the National Park Service, a federal bureau in the Department of the Interior responsible for maintaining national parks and monuments that were then managed by the department. The National Park System has since expanded to 433 units (often referred to as parks), more than 150 related areas, and numerous programs that assist in conserving the nation's natural and cultural heritage for the benefit of current and future generations.

Units/Parks
-----------

The National Park Service manages 433 individual units covering more than 85 million acres in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and US territories. While there are at least 19 [naming designations](https://www.nps.gov/articles/nps-designations.htm), these units are commonly referred to as "parks." Multiple parks may be managed together as an administrative unit within the National Park Service. (See more information about [recent changes in the National Park System](https://www.nps.gov/aboutus/recent-changes.htm) and [park anniversaries](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/npscelebrates/park-anniversaries.htm).)
