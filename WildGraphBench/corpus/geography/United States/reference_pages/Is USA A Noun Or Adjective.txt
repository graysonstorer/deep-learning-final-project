Is USA A Noun Or Adjective?
===========================

[![Image 1: An old-fashioned globe shows part of North America with a focus on Canada, Alaska, and neighboring areas](https://www.dictionary.com/e/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/USA_800x800-790x310.jpg)](https://www.dictionary.com/e/is-usa-a-noun/)

_USA_ is an abbreviation for the _United States of America_. _US_ tends to be the more popular way to abbreviate _United States_. Both of these abbreviations can serve as either adjectives or nouns. However, some style guides prefer _United States_ as the noun form and _US_ as the adjective form.

_USA_
-----

_USA_ is a noun because _United States of America_ is a noun. A _noun_ is a person, place, animal, thing, or idea. _USA_ functions as a noun, for example, in Bruce Springsteen’s song lyric, “I was born in the **USA**.”

_US_ and _U.S._
---------------

_US_ and _U.S._ are both abbreviations of _United States_. Both of these abbreviations can be correct. The difference between them (whether to use periods or not) is just a matter of style.

The _Associated Press Stylebook_ prefers the abbreviation _U.S._ with periods. However, the _Chicago Manual of Style_ prefers _US_ without periods. To complicate matters, the _Chicago Manual of Style_ allows _U.S._ in some situations. The _Associated Press Stylebook_ (which is mostly used by newspapers) advises writers to use _US_ in headlines.

_US_ as an Adjective
--------------------

The _Chicago Manual of Style_ advises writers to use _US_ as an adjective. For example, “He grew up in New Zealand, but he loves **US** television shows.” In this case, _US_ is an adjective because it modifies _television shows_.

According to the _Chicago Manual of Style_, the abbreviation _US_ shouldn’t be used as a noun. Instead, the full phrase _United States_ should be used when the text requires a noun. For example, “He loves **US** culture, so he decided to move to the **United States**.” In this example, _US_ acts as an adjective, while the unabbreviated _United States_ acts as a noun.

The Associated Press takes the same approach to this debate. It advises writers to use _U.S._ when the text requires an adjective and _United States_ when the text requires a noun.

The abbreviation _USA_ is a noun, but the abbreviations _U.S._ and _US_ are preferred by most style guides. Some style guides advise writers to use the abbreviations only as adjectives, and to use _United States_ when a noun is required. However, other style guides allow _US_ to be both an adjective and a noun. Whatever style guide you’re using (or even if you aren’t using one), the most important thing is to stay consistent throughout your work.
