We provide new measures of ethnic, linguistic, and religious fractionalization for about 190 countries. These measures are more comprehensive than those previously used in the economics literature and we compare our new variables with those previously used. We also revisit the question of the effects of ethnic, linguistic, and religious heterogeneity on the quality of institutions and growth. We partly con®rm and partly modify previous results. The patterns of cross-correlations between potential explanatory variables and their different degree of endogeneity makes it hard to make unquali®ed statements about competing explanations for economic growth and the quality of government. Our new data, which features the underlying group structure of ethnicities, religions and languages, also allows the computation of alternative measures of heterogeneity, and we turn to measures of polarization as an alternative to the commonly used index of fractionalization.

1. Introduction 

Ethnic con¯ict is an important determinant of the political economy of many nations and localities. Many believe that it leads to political instability, poor quality of institutions, badly designed economic policy, and disappointing economic performance. *Arnaud Devleeschauwer is a FNRS-Bernheim Research Fellow. We thank Francesco Caselli, James Fearon, Oded Galor and two anonymous referees for useful comments. Jessica Seddon Wallack provided excellent research assistance. All remaining errors are ours. In a cross-country setting, Easterly and Levine (1997) have shown that per capita GDP growth is inversely related to ethnolinguistic fractionalization in a large sample of countries. In particular, they argued that much of Africa's growth failure is due to ethnic con¯ict, partly as a result of absurd borders left by former colonizers. 1 As a result of that paper, a measure of ethnic fractionalization has become a ``standard'' control in regressions explaining cross-national differences in economic success. 2A related literature, early examples being Canning and Fay (1993) and Mauro (1995), has discussed the impact of ethnic fragmentation on government activities and quality of institutions. La Porta et al. (1999), in a broad empirical study of the determinants of the quality of government, suggest that ethnic fractionalization matters, even though variables related to legal origins may be more important. A large literature on US localities show that in more ethnically fragmented communities, public goods provision is less ef®cient, participation in social activities and trust is lower, and economic success, measured by growth of city size, is inferior. 3 Evidence that trust does not travel well across racial lines is also supported by experimental evidence. 4Another related literature, Esteban and Ray (1994) on the theoretical side and Garcia-Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2002) on the empirical side, discuss which are the best measures of heterogeneity. The traditional measure of ethnic fractionalization is given by the probability that two randomly drawn individuals from the population belong to two different groups. Its theoretical maximum is reached (at the value of 1) when each person belongs to a different group. In contrast, simple measures of polarization reach their maximum when two equally sized groups face each other. We use both measures of fractionalization and of polarization in our empirical work, and discuss how results differ across the two sets of indices. While existing measure of racial (or ethnic) fragmentation for the United States are reasonably well-accepted, since they are based upon detailed and reliable census data, cross-country measures have been widely debated. Easterly and Levine (1997) use indices based on ethnolinguistic classi®cation provided by sources from the former Soviet Union, the Atlas Narodov Mira of 1964. These data rely largely on linguistic distinctions, which may obscure other aspect of ethnicity like racial origin, skin color, etc. Interestingly, studies within the United States do not look at language in the racial classi®cation. If they did, blacks and whites would be classi®ed in the same group. As we discuss below, this example shows that although useful, language is not the only way to look at ethnicity. 5 In Latin America several countries are relatively homogeneous in terms of language spoken, often the one of former colonizers, but much less so if skin color or racial origin is taken into account. The World Bank estimates that the percentage of Afro-Latinos in Latin America is higher than the percentage of African±Americans in the United States. Peoples of indigenous or mestizo background also form a large percentage of the population in most Latin American countries. Another dif®culty in measuring heterogeneity is that ethnic classi®cations are not set in stone, and are more complex than can be summarized by simple measures. For example, the Oromo in Ethiopia are split into ®ve different groups as a result of regional migrations and intermixing with other groups, suggesting that fractionalization evolves endogenously as a function of migration and intergroup mixing. The infamous Hutu±Tutsi divide in Burundi was thought by some to have been greatly accentuated (some even say created) by 156 ALBERTO ALESINA ET AL. Belgian colonizers, suggesting that fractionalization may also be endogenous because the de®nition of groups can shift overtime. People of African origin do not have as clear a dividing line from the rest of the population in many Latin American countries as they do in the United States, suggesting that ethnic differences may not be suf®cient to fully characterize the degree of heterogeneity. Hence, ethnic classi®cations are fraught with ambiguities, as we discuss in depth below. Having mentioned this important caveat, our measures of ethnic, linguistic, and religious heterogeneity capture distinctions that may still matter enormously for economic outcomes. This paper seeks to achieve four goals. First, we provide a new measure of ethnic fragmentation based on a broader classi®cation of groups, taking into account not only language but also other cleavages such as racial characteristics. We provide this measure for many more countries (almost twice as many) than those normally used in the literature, using different sources, and we discuss in detail similarities and differences between our measure and previous ones. We construct three new indices, one based on a broad measure of ethnicity, one based strictly on language, and one based on religion. Another advantage of our new data is that we identify each ethnic, religious, and linguistic group for each country in our sample, allowing us to compute alternative measures of heterogeneity. Second, we show that indices of fractionalization constructed using measures of ethnicity, language or religion lead to substantially different results when they are entered in regressions to explain growth and government quality. Third, using our new measures we reexamine the evidence on the effects of ethnic fragmentation on two general areas: economic growth and the quality of institutions and policy. We reach interesting results: a. On economic growth, we broadly con®rm the results by Easterly and Levine (1997). In fact the negative effect of ethnic fragmentation on growth is reinforced with the new data, and we are able to highlight the differences between ethnic, linguistic, and religious fractionalization. b. On quality of government and policies we make some progress over La Porta et al. (1999). They argued that both legal origin, distance from the equator and ethnolinguistic fractionalization explain the quality of government. In their results, legal origin variables tend to be stronger than ethnolinguistic fractionalization. We argue that results on this point are sensitive to the speci®cation, and one can easily produce reasonable speci®cations in which ethnic fragmentation ``dominates'' legal origin. We do not intend to argue that ethnic fractionalization ``beats'' legal origin, but more modestly that the pattern of correlation between independent variables makes it very hard to resolve this horse race. Most likely both set of variables are important, and we discuss carefully the patterns of cross-correlation between these variables and the potential channels linking fractionalization to government quality. c. Ethnic fractionalization is also closely correlated with GDP per capita and geographic variables, like latitude. Ethnic fragmentation is higher in poorer countries that are closer to the equator. This complicates even more the task of FRACTIONALIZATION 157 characterizing the role of ethnic fragmentation as a determinant of policy variables, the quality of government and growth. Thus the pattern of cross-correlations between explanatory variables cannot be ignored when drawing conclusions on these issues. As is well known, in many cases the results of cross-country regressions are sensitive to the econometric speci®cation, and this case is no exception. Useful lessons can be learned from this sensitivity, however, as it may inform us as to the channels whereby fractionalization operated to depress growth or reduce the quality of government. d. While ethnic and linguistic fractionalization are associated with negative outcomes in terms of the quality of government, religious fractionalization is not; in fact, if anything, this measure displays a positive correlation with measures of good governance. This is because measured religious fractionalization tends to be higher in more tolerant and free societies, like the United States, which in fact displays one the of the highest level of religious fractionalization. This result has no bearing, however, on the question of whether speci®c religious denominations are correlated with better politico-economic outcomes, an issue recently explored by Barro and McLeary (2002). Finally we explore which indicator of heterogeneity is more correlated with variables of interest. We conclude that the measure of fractionalization traditionally used in the literature performs a bit better than measures of polarization proposed by Garcia-Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2002). The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present our new data and new indices of ethnic fractionalization. In Section 3, we present evidence on the relationship between fractionalization and growth in a broad cross-section of countries. In Section 4, we examine how fractionalization relates to the quality of government and institutions. Section 5 summarizes our results using measures of polarization. Section 6 discusses the impact of ethnic fractionalization on economic variables in individual countries. Section 7 concludes. 

2. New Measures of Fractionalization 6

2.1. The Data 

Our main goal in gathering data on fractionalization is to clearly distinguish between ethnic, religious, and linguistic heterogeneity. Ethnic and linguistic differences were previously lumped together as part of an ``ethnolinguistic'' fractionalization variable. The data most frequently used in the literature was compiled in the Soviet Union in the early 1960s on the basis of primary country sources, and published in the Atlas Narodov Mira in 1964. The ethnolinguistic fractionalization variable (often referred to as ELF) was computed as one minus the Her®ndahl index of ethnolinguistic group shares, and re¯ected the probability that two randomly selected individuals from a population belonged to 158 ALBERTO ALESINA ET AL. different groups. 7 We use the same formula, applied to different underlying data, to compute our measures of fractionalization: FRACT j  1  XNi  1

s2

> ij

; 1

where s ij is the share of group i i  1 . . . N in country j. Below, we consider alternative measures of heterogeneity, based on the concept of polarization. A major obstacle to distinguishing between ethnic and linguistic variables is that language is part of the criterion used by ethnologists and anthropologists to de®ne the concept of ethnicity. This is true, for example, in Africa, where racial or physical criteria are seldom used to de®ne ethnic groups. This is not the case, however, in Latin America, where characteristics typically used to distinguish between ethnic groups are racial in nature. To our knowledge, no measures of racial fragmentation exist for a broad cross-section of countries, largely because the underlying data on group size is missing for most countries. Moreover, gathering such data would be fraught with conceptual problems, such as the de®nition of the physiological characteristics that distinguish races. One feasible improvement over existing measures, however, is to compile a separate variable for linguistic fractionalization in isolation of any racial of physical characteristics. Our variable ``language'' is based exclusively on data from Encyclopedia Britannica 

(2001), which reports the shares of languages spoken as ``mother tongues,'' generally based on national census data. Other possible sources for language data include the CIA World Factbook (which, however, only lists the shares of each language for a few countries) and the Ethnologue project, which lists approximately 6,800 languages. 8Fractionalization measures constructed from these sources are closely related, as they are based on very similar country source data. 9 Our data includes 1,055 major linguistic groups for 201 countries or dependencies. We also compute a separate variable for religious fractionalization (``religion''), based on data from the Encyclopedia Britannica (2001). The distinctions in this data are perhaps less controversial and subject to arbitrary de®nitions than the data on linguistic and ethnic fractionalization, since the boundaries of religions are more clear and de®nitions consistent across countries. Our data cover 294 different religions in 215 countries and dependencies. Finally, the main variable we focus on is a measure of ethnic fractionalization, ``ethnicity.'' As suggested above, the de®nition of ethnicity involves a combination of racial and linguistic characteristics. For example, our data on Bolivia involves the following groups: Blancos (10.13 percent), Aymara (30.38 percent), Quechua (30.38 percent), Mestizos (25.32 percent) and others groups (indigenous and Afro, 3.80 percent). This, like the data for most of the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean, is based on racial distinctions rather than linguistic distinctions. In fact, our language data for Bolivia looks very different: Aymara 3.24 percent, Guarani 0.12 percent, Quechua 8.15 percent, Spanish 87.65 percent, Other 0.84 percent. In contrast, the ethnicity data for some European countries such as Belgium, Luxembourg, and Switzerland largely re¯ects languages (for example, the ``ethnicities'' we have identi®ed in Switzerland include: German 65 percent, French 18 percent, Italian FRACTIONALIZATION 159 10 percent, other Swiss 6 percent and Romansch 1 percent). The same holds for much of Sub-Saharan Africa. These classi®cations re¯ect the judgment of ethnologists and anthropologists on the appropriate de®nition of ethnicity, which to our knowledge remains a rather vague and amorphous concept. It would be wrong to interpret our ethnicity variable as re¯ecting racial characteristics alone, but it does re¯ect these characteristics to a greater extent than our language variable, and it should thus be expected to bear a different relationship to economic variables. An important goal of our collection of ethnicity data was to obtain data on various ethnic groups that was as disaggregated as we could ®nd. This required the use of multiple sources of data, which we painstakingly checked against each other for consistency. The primary source was the Encyclopedia Britannica (2001), which was the source of our data in 124 of 190 countries. This was completed with data from the CIA (2000) for 25 countries, Levinson (1998) for 23 cases and Minority Rights Group International (1997) for 13 cases. For France, Israel, the United States, and New Zealand, we directly consulted the national censuses of these countries to come up with ethnicity data as disaggregated as available. 10 The rule we followed for data collection was as follows: if two or more sources for the index of ethnic fractionalization were identical to the third decimal point, we used these sources (this was generally recorded as data sourced from the Encyclopedia Britannica ). If sources diverged in such a way that the index of fractionalization differed to the second decimal point, we used the source where reported ethnic groups covered the greatest share of the total population. If this was 100 percent in more than one source, we used the source with the most disaggregated data (i.e. the greatest number of reported ethnic groups). In the end, our ethnicity variable covers approximately 650 distinct ethnic groups in 190 countries and dependencies. 

2.2. Endogeneity 

An important issue to contend with is that of changes in the ethnic fractionalization index through time, i.e. the issue of endogeneity. This is important because our data is from recent sources (generally the early to mid-1990s). If there were major shifts in ethnic composition, using data from the end of our period to explain variables for the 1960±1995 period could lead to endogeneity bias. Shifts in ethnic composition could stem from changes in the shares of each group or from changes in the de®nition of the various ethnic groups. Ethnic fractionalization indices are generally taken as exogenous in cross-country regressions, based on the fact that group shares are suf®ciently stable that changes only have a minor impact on fractionalization measures. This seems a reasonable assumption at the 30 year horizon of the typical cross-country regression, even though this assumption may be less tenable for a much longer horizon. Think, for instance, of different fertility rates across ethnic groups. Another problem could occur if the de®nitions of ethnic groups changed through time, as a function of economic or political variables. The possibility of such changes in de®nitions has been pointed out by the ``re¯exive'' school in ethnology and sociology. According to the re¯exive theory of ethnicity and nationality, the boundaries of ethnic groups are changing because individual's self-identi®cation to groups can change as a 160 ALBERTO ALESINA ET AL. result of social, economic or political forces, and ethnicity is therefore endogenous, especially at long horizons. 11 One recent example of this phenomenon is Somalia: prior to the 1991 civil war, this country appeared relatively homogeneous (85 percent Somalis), but during and after the civil war ``clans'' became the dominant dimension of ethnic cleavage. In other words, a political event led to the creation of a new dimension of ethnic cleavage, and self-identi®cation to groups now re¯ect preexisting clans rather than the Somali ``ethnicity.'' 12 In general, it does not matter for our purposes whether ethnic differences re¯ect physical attributes of groups (skin color, facial features) or long-lasting social conventions (language, marriage within the group, cultural norms) or simple social de®nition (self-identi®cation, identi®cation by outsiders). When people persistently identify with a particular group, they form potential interest groups that can be manipulated by political leaders, who often choose to mobilize some coalition of ethnic groups (``us'') to the exclusion of others (``them''). Politicians can also mobilize support by singling out some groups for persecution, where hatred of the minority group is complementary to some policy the politician wishes to pursue (Glaeser, 2002). The bottom line is that while we recognize that ethnic fractionalization could to some extent be endogenous, and that the previous literature has probably underplayed this point, we do not believe this is a very serious problem at the horizon of 20±30 years which characterizes our cross-country work. While the example of Somalia is interesting, in our sample period such examples are rare and ethnic fractionalization displays tremendous time persistence. The problem of the endogeneity of our religious fragmentation variable is more serious. Repressive regimes, especially those with a religious bent, may make it dif®cult for individuals to be ``counted'' as members of the non-of®cially sanctioned religion. This phenomenon could introduce a spurious correlation between (lack of ) political freedom and religious fragmentation. 

2.3. Comparison with Existing Measures 

We now compare our measures of linguistic, ethnic, and religious fractionalization with the index of ethnolinguistic fractionalization based on the Soviet data usually used in the literature. First, our indices are available for many more countries, between 190 and 215 compared to 112 for the Soviet index. Table 1 displays the sample means and number of observations for our new indices (excluding dependencies). Table 2 shows the pairwise correlations between these four indices. The Soviet sample is, with very few exceptions, a            

> Table 1. Sample means of the fractionalization measures (excluding dependencies). Variable Number of Observations Sample Mean Religion 198 0.439 Ethnic 180 0.435 Language 185 0.385 ELF 112 0.418 FRACTIONALIZATION

161 subsample of our own. Not surprisingly, the correlations between our ethnic and linguistic index and the Soviet index are fairly high (0.76 and 0.88, respectively). Instead, the religious fractionalization index bears a much lower correlation with the other three indices. Our data gathering effort can also be related to recent attempts by other scholars to gather cross-country ethnic heterogeneity data. Annett (2001) presents an index of ethnolinguistic fractionalization closely related conceptually to the Soviet data, using data exclusively published in the World Christian Encyclopedia (Barrett, 1982), a source distinct from our own. He also presents data on religious fractionalization, but does not attempt to isolate linguistic fractionalization like we do. His data cover 150 countries (compared to 190 for our ethnicity variable and 215 for our religion variable). Perhaps reassuringly given the different sources, for the overlapping sample of countries the correlation between his ethnolinguistic fractionalization variable and our ethnicity variable is 88.85 percent. The correlation between his religious fractionalization variable and our own is 83.66 percent. Even more recently, Fearon (2002) has gathered detailed data on ethnic groups for 160 countries, from sources that sometimes overlap with ours (he does not present data for religious and linguistic fractionalization). His data is slightly less disaggregated than ours (each country displays on average 5.11 groups in his dataset, versus 5.55 in ours), partly because he restricts attention to groups making up more than 1 percent of the population. These small differences do not greatly impact our respective measures of fractionalization: as Fearon reports (2002, p. 3), referring to our dataset, ``the descriptive statistics for their ethnic measure look broadly similar to those for the measure constructed here.'' Table 3 highlights differences across regions amongst our three indices and ELF. With the exception of East and South East Asia, our ethnic fractionalization index show more fractionalization than the Soviet index. Given the way it is constructed, this is not surprising. Particularly interesting is the case of Latin America, were our ethnic fractionalization index is on average much higher than ELF. This is because, in this region, many ethnically diverse groups (as captured by skin color), often speak the same language as former European colonizers, Spanish, English or Portuguese. So a classi®cation based purely on language shows a much lower degree of fractionalization than one that includes racial characteristics. In fact our linguistic fractionalization index leads to an average of 0.16 versus an average of 0.42 for the ethnicity index. The Soviet index is closer to our         

> Table 2. Pairwise correlations of the fractionalization measures. Religion Ethnic Language ELF Religion 1(198) Ethnic 0.142 (180) 1(180) Language 0.269 (185) 0.697 (171) 1(185) ELF 0.372 (111) 0.759 (110) 0.878 (108) 1(112)

162 ALBERTO ALESINA ET AL. linguistic index. Note how Sub-Saharan Africa displays the highest index of fractionalization in every single column. Appendix A displays these ®gures country by country. Restricting our attention to countries with more than one million inhabitants, according to our data the most ethnically diverse country in the world is Uganda, with afractionalization index of 0.93. The 13 most ethnically diverse countries are all in Sub-Saharan Africa, followed by Yugoslavia and then seven more SubSaharan African countries. The least ethnically fractionalized countries are South Korea, Japan, and North Korea. Turning to linguistic fractionalization, the most diverse countries are again 18 Sub-Saharan African countries (note that the de®nition of ethnicity there largely overlaps with linguistic distinctions). They are followed by India, with a linguistic fractionalization index of 0.81. The least diverse countries are South Korea and North Korea, followed by Yemen. Finally, turning to religious fractionalization, the most diverse countries are South Africa, the United States, and Australia, and the least diverse Yemen, Somalia, Morocco, Turkey, and Algeria. 

2.4. Additional Uses of the Data 

Our data has the potential to free researchers from their exclusive reliance on the fractionalization index. This is because it provides the whole distribution of ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups, instead of just one arbitrary statistic. In contrast, the ELF index forced reliance on fractionalization. With our new data at hand, researchers can write down models, examine the implications of these models with respect to the appropriate measures of heterogeneity, easily calculate them from the data, and test their

FRACTIONALIZATION

163 models more directly. Thus, our data allows for a much more serious grounding of empirical work in theoretical models. For example, in Section 5, we examine measures of polarization, rather than fractionalization, since many models based on con¯ict suggest that measures of polarization are more appropriate to capture the intensity of disagreements across groups. Another novel feature is that our dataset contains group names, so users can actually identify the groups. For example, Liberia, one of the most ethnically fractionalized country in our sample, has 13 separate ethnic groups: the Kpelle (18.3 percent), Bassa (13.3 percent), Dan (8.3 percent), Grebo (7.5 percent), Kru (7.3 percent), Ma (7.2 percent), Manding/Vai (7.0 percent), Loma (6.0 percent), Americo-Liberians (5.0 percent), Krahn (4.7 percent), Gola (4.7 percent), Kissi (3.3 percent) and Gbandi (3.0 percent). In contrast, one of the least fractionalized country in our sample (South Korea) only displays two groups: Koreans (99.9 percent) and others (0.1 percent). To give a sense of the possibilities offered by our new data, Table 4 presents statistics on the number of available ethnic groups for different geographic areas. 13 Counting entries in each country, our dataset has a total of 1,054 entries, corresponding to 650 distinct ethnic groups. The average number of groups per country is highest in Sub-Saharan Africa (7.61 groups per country), and lowest in Latin America (4.22). Sub-Saharan Africa only has one country containing a group that represents more than 90 percent of the total population (out of 44 countries) while 17 out of 28 industrialized countries (including countries in Europe, North America, plus Japan, New Zealand, and Australia) display this

3. Fractionalization and Growth 

In this section we revisit the question of the relationship between fractionalization and long-run growth. For the sake of comparison, we closely follow the speci®cation of Easterly and Levine (1997). We begin in Table 5 by showing the correlation between several economic variables of interest and our three measures of fractionalization: ethnic, linguistic, and religious. Our ethnic variable is highly negatively correlated with GDP per capita growth, schooling and telephones per capita. These correlations are slightly lower for the linguistic measure. The measure of religious fractionalization does not seem to bear any pattern of correlations with the above mentioned variables. Table 6 is organized in exactly the same way as Easterly and Levine's (1997, Table 4). This table shows that our measure of ethnic fractionalization is inversely related to per capita growth, as shown in column 1. The next three columns show that as one controls for more and more variables, the effect of fractionalization vanishes. The point is that variables such as schooling, telephones per worker, etc., can be understood as channels through which the ethnic fractionalization variable affects growth. Table 7 highlights this by reproducing Table 6 of Easterly and Levine (1997). It shows that ethnic fractionalization is strongly negatively correlated with schooling, ®nancial depth, ®scal surplus, and the log of telephones per worker (these results are the same as in Easterly and Levine except for the ®scal surplus, where Easterly and Levine did not ®nd a signi®cant association). This negative effect of racial fractionalization on infrastructure and

165 productive public goods will be discussed in more detail in Section 4. Since ethnic fractionalization affects variables that in turn affect growth, there is a reduced form relationship between these variables and growth. The partial association between growth and fractionalization vanishes once we control for the intermediating variables. In terms of economic magnitudes, the results in Table 6 suggest that going from complete ethnic homogeneity (an index of 0) to complete heterogeneity (an index of 1) depresses annual growth by 1.9 percentage points (column 1). In other words, up to 1.77 percentage points of the difference in annual growth between South Korea and Uganda can be explained by different degrees of ethnic fractionalization. This effect is reduced as we control for variables that can be interpreted as channels through which ethnic fractionalization affects growth. However, since our regressions contain the log of initial income on the right-hand side, the regressors are to be interpreted as determinants of

Perhaps a better way to get a sense of the magnitude of our effect is to examine implications in terms of steady-state income differences rather than transitional growth rate. The equation in column (1) of Table 6 implies a steady-state level of income that will be 14 percent lower for every 0.10 increase in ethnic fractionalization. If Korea had Uganda's ethnic fractionalization, the income level differential between them would have been reduced by half. In Tables 8 and 10 we rerun the same regressions as in Table 6, but using religious fractionalization and linguistic fractionalization. While linguistic fractionalization is strongly inversely related to growth, religious fractionalization is not. In fact, as Table 5 already showed religious fractionalization does not seem to be correlated with any of the other right-hand side variable. This contrasts with linguistic fractionalization, especially for telephones per workers and schooling, a result which is con®rmed in Tables 9 and 11 and in Section 4. Overall our results are quite similar to those of Easterly and Levine (1997), perhaps even a little stronger when using our new measure of linguistic fractionalization. The differences in the results between religious and linguistic and ethnic fractionalization are quite suggestive. Religious af®liation is the most endogenous of the three variables. Religions can be banned and individual can relatively easily ``hide'' their religious af®liation to avoid repression. Individuals and families can change from one religion to another far more easily than they can change race (!) or language. In a sense, a higher observed measure of religious fractionalization can be a sign of a more tolerant and democratic form of government. In a more repressive regime, you can hide your religion or conform to the state-imposed religion, but hiding your racial origin, especially if it relates to skin color, is much more dif®cult. Short of genocide, it is dif®cult to change the ethnic composition of a country. As early as 1830, Tocqueville (1990) had noted this problem with reference to slavery in America. He wrote that ``there is a natural prejudice that prompts men to despise whoever has been their inferior long after he has become their equal . . . But amongst the ancients this secondary consequence of slavery had a natural

In the United States, instead, skin color differences between blacks and whites makes assimilation more dif®cult. In other words, skin color becomes an important focal point to characterize lasting differences and perceptions, as also argued by Caselli and Coleman (2002). 

4. Fractionalization and Government Quality 

One of the reasons why ethnic fractionalization may negatively in¯uence economic success in terms of growth and income levels has to do with the potentially negative effects of ethnic con¯ict on the quality of policy and institutions. In a sweeping empirical study La Porta et al. (1999) have investigated the determinants of the quality of

They concluded that a country's legal origins are an important determinant of these variables, while the ethnic fractionalization variable (the same as used by Easterly and Levine, 1997) bore a reduced form relationship with government quality. However, fractionalization was typically not signi®cant after controlling for the level of GDP per capita (which however could be endogenous) and latitude. Table 12 reports a matrix of correlation between all the variables used as potential explanations for the quality of government. Note that our measures of linguistic and ethnic fractionalization are highly correlated with latitude and GDP per capita. Therefore it is quite dif®cult to disentangle the independent effect of these three variables on the quality of government. While GDP per capita is very likely to be endogenous to the left-hand side variables, so that it is unclear whether one should control for it or not, the other two variables are less endogenous. Also, ethnic fractionalization and latitude are less obviously linked by causal relationships than the same two variables are with income. The correlation between latitude and ethnic fractionalization is quite high, about 0.4. This makes it hard to disentangle the effect of one variable from the other and the result in this type of cross-sectional regressions will depend on the speci®cation. On a priori grounds, while one can think of several reasons why ethnic con¯ict may affect policy outcomes and institutions, the relationship between latitude and, say, the regulation of economic activity or the protection of property rights seems much less obvious. The measure of religious fragmentation displays a much lower level of correlation with GDP per capita; in fact this correlation is basically zero. Our ethnic fractionalization variable displays a positive correlation (0.2) with the dummy variables for French legal origins, which according to La Porta et al. (1999) is associated with poor quality of government. This does not help in separating the effects of legal origins from those of fractionalization. In Table 13 we run a set of regressions along the lines of La Porta et al. (1999). Table 13 is organized as follows. For each left-hand side variable, we present the coef®cient on

169 fractionalization from three regressions. 14 The ®rst one reproduces exactly the full speci®cation of La Porta et al. (1999), including their speci®cation which include the largest number of independent variables, i.e. legal origins, religious variables, latitude, etc. To these variables we have added our measure of ethnic fractionalization. Column 2 present a minimalist speci®cation, which includes only country size and regional dummies. Column 3 adds to this speci®cation income per capita and legal origins variables. For brevity we do not report another column including also the religious variables, but the results (available upon request) are similar to those of column 3. Note that the omitted legal origins variable is the British one. Tables 14 and 15 replicate these regressions with, respectively, the measures of linguistic and religious fractionalization. Several observations are in order. 1. Our index of ethnic fractionalization is signi®cant in the ``minimalist'' regression, column 2, for corruption, bureaucratic delays, infrastructure quality, infant mortality,

It is signi®cant or nearly signi®cant in column 3 (controlling for GDP per capita) for corruption, infant mortality, and illiteracy. The sign of the coef®cient always implies that more fractionalization leads to a lower quality of government. This index is also negatively associated with the share of transfers over GDP, a result consistent with those obtained by Alesina et al. (2001) on a much smaller sample of countries, and by Alesina and Wacziarg (1998) on a large sample of countries but with different data on government spending. It seems that

The democracy index is inversely related to ethnic fractionalization (when latitude is not controlled for). This result is consistent with theory and evidence presented in Aghion et al. (2002). The idea is that in more fragmented societies a group imposes restrictions on political liberty to impose control on the other groups. In more homogeneous societies, it is easier to rule more democratically since con¯icts are less intense. 15 3. Overall the index of linguistic fractionalization seems to work less well than the index based on ethnicity, in the sense of leading to coef®cients that are less robust to changes of speci®cation and more often statistically insigni®cant. 4. The index of religious fractionalization bears a positive relationship to controlling corruption, preventing bureaucratic delays, tax compliance, transfers, infrastructure quality, lower infant mortality, lower illiteracy, school attainment, democracy, and political rights.

Our interpretation is that observed religious fragmentation is larger in more tolerant countries. 5. The index of ethnic fractionalization loses statistical signi®cance in many of the regressions with the full speci®cation used by of La Porta et al. (1999). This is because these regressions include latitude and, as we argued above, this variable is highly correlated with ethnic fractionalization. The ethnic fractionalization variable remains signi®cant at standard levels even after controlling for latitude in the case of infant mortality and the share of state-owned enterprises. In virtually all other cases the ethnic fractionalization variable retains the ``expected'' sign but it is not statistically different from zero at standard levels of con®dence. This re¯ects the dif®culty in disentangling the effects of latitude, per capita income (which again may not belong in the regression due to endogeneity), and fractionalization. The high correlation between fractionalization and latitude, in particular, creates some problems of interpretation. Those who hold a prior that geography affects institutions directly or indirectly will ®nd some support for their view in these results. However the same can be said for those who believe that con¯icts amongst groups brings about more dif®cult and inef®cient policy making and that ethnic fractionalization simply happens to be correlated with latitude.

5. Polarization 

Our measures of fractionalization, while the most widespread in the literature, are not the only measures of ethnic, religious, and linguistic heterogeneity available. In particular, scholars have recently started to calculate and use measures of polarization, rather than fractionalization. 16 Holding the ``distance'' between groups constant, polarization is typically maximized when there are two groups of equal size, whereas fractionalization increases when there are many small groups. Additionally, the degree of polarization

All speci®cations include a constant. FRACTIONALIZATION 177 should increase as the ``distance'' between groups increases. When it comes to ethnic, linguistic, and religious groups, however, the concept of distance is hard to capture with simple measures, so that researchers have implicitly assumed that the distance between groups is constant across group pairs. 17 Whether societal con¯ict is the result of fractionalization or polarization is largely an unresolved question in theory, calling for empirical work. The discussion of whether a country with many relatively small groups is more or less stable than one with only two equally sized groups is an old one, and goes back at least to Madison in the Federalist Papers of 1788 (nos 10 and 11, see Hamilton et al., 1911). Without much of a stretch of Madison's views, one can argue that a polarization measure is, according to him, the appropriate concept to capture heterogeneity. In what follows, we extend our estimates of the effects of ethnic, religious, and linguistic heterogeneity on growth and government quality using measures of polarization. Esteban and Ray (1994) develop a theory of polarization and axiomatically derive a measure of income polarization with ``desirable'' features. 18 They show that a desirable measure of polarization must take the form: 

Ps; y  K Xni  1

Xnj  1

s1  a 

> i

s jjy i  y jj; 2

where K is a constant, a is a constant between 0 and 1.6, and yi is the income of group 

i  1 . . . n ( polarization here is de®ned with respect to incomeÐit is presumed there is no within group variation in income). This de®nes a fairly narrow class of measures, since the only degrees of freedom are K (a scaling factor) and a. In order to compute this measure for ethnically de®ned groups we need a measure of the distance between groups (the analog of jy i  y jj in equation (2)). Lacking such a measure, the empirical literature has had to assume that the distance between every group is the same. 19 We have repeated all the previous estimations using the measure of polarization based on equation (2) rather than fractionalization. For the sake of brevity, we do not report the estimates, which are available upon request. We set K  1 and considered three values of 

aÐthe two extreme values 0 and 1.6, and an intermediate value of 0.8. 20 In a context where we have to assume that jy i  y jj is constant for all i= j, it is easy to show that a value of a  0 leads to a measure that is perfectly correlated with the fractionalization measure presented earlier if and only if every group in a country's population is observed (so that the sum of observed group shares equals 1). 21 A summary of our results is as follows: 1. The polarization indices, especially when computed with an a around the middle of the feasible range (i.e. around 0.8), are highly correlated with the fractionalization measures. This is due to the assumption of equal distance between all groups within a given country, an assumption required by our lack of data on those distances. 2. We ®nd that polarization indices with a equal to 0.8 perform relatively better than those with an extreme value of 1.6. Thus the index of polarization that works best is the one that is most correlated with fractionalization. 178 ALBERTO ALESINA ET AL. 3. In the growth regressions, the results seems substantially weaker using the polarization index. When both indices are used together, the fragmentation index typically remains signi®cant and the polarization index is not. 4. In the quality of government regressions the index of ethnic fractionalization works slightly better than the corresponding index of polarization. In these regressions, because of the high correlation between the two indices, when they are used together the results are generally not easily interpretable. 5. We obtain poor results using linguistic polarization in the quality of government regressions whatever the value of a.6. As for the fractionalization index, religious polarization is associated with better performances in the areas of regulation, red tape, corruption, tax compliance, transfers and political rights, especially when a has an intermediate value of 0.8. Higher religious polarization is also associated with better public goods, lower infant mortality and illiteracy rates, higher levels of schooling and better infrastructure. The bottom line is that the measure of polarization produces similar but slightly worse results than the result with fractionalization when we choose a parameter value for a that makes the correlation between the two indices high. When the choose of parameter values makes the polarization index less correlated with fractionalization, the latter is a better predictor of our outcome variables. Garcia-Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2002) show that their index of polarization predicts civil wars better than fractionalization. Their results and ours are not contradictory. It may very well be the case that a civil war is more likely when two large equally size group face each other than when many small groups are present. A war is also more likely when the two groups are roughly of equal size than when one is clearly predominant since in that case the dominant one can more easily repress the other one and avoid war. However, the quality of policy may be specially bad when many groups ®ght over public resources. 

6. The Effects of Ethnic Con¯ict: A Few Examples 

A cross-country statistical exercise is a crude way to summarize complex political and economic histories of countries and their constituent ethnic groups. A promising direction for future research, to supplement large-sample studies, would be for economists to do more case histories of development, economic policy, and government quality in ethnically diverse places. In this sections we brie¯y examine some individual data points to illustrate salient ethnic divisions as well as the complex history that lies behind our cross-sectional associations. Nigeria has among the highest ethnic and linguistic diversity in the entire sample, and was also ranked as highly diverse by Easterly and Levine (1997). Maier (2000) makes it clear that it would be hard to ®nd a better example of institutional and policy failure leading to FRACTIONALIZATION 179 underdevelopment. Nigeria has produced $280 billion in oil revenues since the discovery of reserves in the late 1950s, but the average Nigerian is no further out of poverty today than four decades ago. Such egregious failures as the $8 billion state-owned Ajaokuta steel complex, which has yet to produce a bar of steel, give a hint of the breakdown of state institutions. The standard account of Nigeria's ethnic con¯ict pits the Muslim North versus the Christian South, but this is a simpli®cation. First, the Christian South is divided between the Yoruba and Igbo. Second, there are substantial Southern minority groups living in Northern cities, a situation that has led to recurrent communal violence. Third, fractious ethnic groups in the center of the country and in the oil-rich Niger delta keep small-scale con¯ict going even out of the limelight of the Hausa/Yoruba/Igbo three-way ethnic war. Table 16 shows that Nigeria has had disastrous economic policies (high black market premia), poor infrastructure (virtually no telephone density) and high corruption. Ethiopia also has very high ethnic and linguistic diversity (according to both new and old measures), and ethnic con¯ict has been at the center of Ethiopian history for centuries. Ethiopia has had one of the lowest growth rates in the world over the past half-century and as a result remains one of the least developed nations. It has known various types of regimes, from monarchy to Marxist-Leninist to reformist, but growth has been mediocre to poor under all of them. Political/ethnic con¯ict and disastrous institutions have partly caused and certainly magni®ed the effects of major disasters such as famine, AIDS, civil war, and international war, and these disasters have absorbed a high share of the government's paltry aid and tax revenues. The current government is dominated by the Tigray Peoples's Liberation Front, representing an ethnic group making up only 6 percent of the population. The latter is alleged to own a large number of agricultural, industrial, and ®nancial businesses under the umbrella of the Endowment Fund for the Rehabilitation of Tigray. 22 The current government is attempting to prevent ethnic con¯icts by decentralizing power to ethnically de®ned regions, including the promotion of local languages. However, this strategy remains deeply controversial. At one extreme, some observers see it as a ploy by the Tigrayan ruling elite to divide the potential opposition along ethnic lines, as well as to undercut the national government bureaucracy. The rulers are alleged to have co-opted participants from other

180 ALBERTO ALESINA ET AL. ethnic groups rather than allowed representative organizations to emerge. There are also accusations of a second level of oppression, this time by the dominant majority group in each region oppressing the regional minorities (on some accounts, there are over 80 ethnic groups in Ethiopia, but only nine regions). Some Ethiopians decry the threat to the unity and identity of the country and the ``ethnicization'' of politics. Of course, ethnicization is far from new, given the long-standing Amhara dominance of the state, and its ``colonization'' of other ``nationalities.'' Some see the current government as simply substituting Tigray dominance for Amhara dominance (see Tronvoll, 2000). More charitable observers see government policy as an honest attempt to address the ethnic divisions that have bedeviled Ethiopia for much of its history (today there continues to be an armed insurgency by the Oromo Liberation Front). 23 These observers see the current government as responding to this history of domination by the Amhara by granting autonomy to the ``nationalities.'' Botswana is an interesting exception to the poor economic outcomes and low quality government in most of Africa. The table shows it had high growth, a low black market premium, a government surplus, and low corruption. While we do not mean to give a monocausal explanation for this success, it is notable that it has relatively low ethnic diversity for Africa. Acemoglu et al. (2003) describe how the Tswana tribes had a long history of cooperation amongst themselves before independence, as well as generally inclusive institutions since. Ethiopia and Nigeria were already highly diverse relative to Botswana in the old Easterly and Levine (1997) dataset. Even more interesting is the much higher degree of ethnic diversity in some Latin American and Caribbean countries according to our new ethnic fractionalization measure. Among the poorest, most institutionally underdeveloped, and most con¯ict-ridden societies in this region are Bolivia, Ecuador, and Guyana. All of these score lower on linguistic fractionalization (and hence did not show up as very ethnically diverse in Easterly and Levine, 1997) than on ethnic fractionalization, because of racial differences. A Latin American success story, Chile, continues to show up as relatively homogeneous. To take Bolivia as an example, whites (about 10 percent of the population) dominated the governments of Bolivia with systematic exploitation of Mestizos, Aymara and Quechua peoples from colonial times to 1952 (Klein, 1992). Six percent of landowners owned 92 percent of the land in 1950. There were feudal anachronisms such as an obligation for Indian tenants to spend part of their time as unpaid servants in the landowner's household. A literacy requirement prevented the majority of the population from voting. The Indians successfully revolted in 1952, redistributed land toward the peasants, and abolished the more obvious exclusionary laws. However, whites continued to dominate politics and economics. Political instability remained endemic after 1952, with frequent military coups overthrowing democratic regimes. Democracy has been restored since 1982, but racial con¯ict continues. When one of the authors visited Bolivia in early 2002, Indian activists were blockading the main roads surrounding La Paz to articulate various grievances. A meeting of the leaders of the 1952 revolutionary party was conspicuous for its lack of Indian representation. Anecdotally, it appeared that racist sentiments toward the Indians still existed amongst the white elite. Bolivia still has poor growth, high corruption, poor social service delivery, and predatory police and judges. FRACTIONALIZATION 181 Guyana shows up as ethnically diverse in our data because of its racial breakdown between Africans, East Indians, Europeans, and others. The Afro-Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese are the predominant groups and are almost numerically equal. Since they have mobilized politically along ethnic lines (supporting two different parties since before independence), any consensus for development has been torn apart by competition for rents between the two groups. As Table 16 shows, Guyana is rated as one of the most corrupt countries in the world, has followed distortionary economic policies, and has had very poor growth outcomes. Chile, in contrast, is a well known Latin American success story. It has pursued free market reforms since the 1970s under ®rst military and later democratically elected governments. Although it did have political and economic gyrations under Allende in the early 1970s and then a debt crisis and severe political repression under Pinochet in the early 1980s, the last 20 years have shown a high degree of political and economic stability and sustained growth. By the 1980s, Chile had also achieved a high level of schooling and infrastructure (Table 16). There are certainly many causes explaining why reforms were made possible, in particular the authoritarian and repressive nature of the Pinochet regime, which made it easier to eliminate opposition to reform. After the period of repression a considerable amount of consensus emerged on policy. Many other developing countries experienced bloody coups, and did not evolve into peaceful and rapidly growing economies. The difference in Chile was probably due to its higher level of homogeneity. In fact, after Pinochet's departure from power the new democratic regime showed remarkable stability by Latin American standards. The relative ethnic homogeneity of Chilean society may have made achieving support for reform and economic development easier than in Bolivia or Guyana. 

7. Conclusion 

The question of what makes different countries more or less successful economically and what explains the quality of their policies is one of the most fascinating that economists can ask, but it is also one of the most dif®cult to answer. Different authors have their own ``favorite'' explanatory variables: from purely ``economic'' ones, to geographic ones, to legal ones, to political, cultural, religious and historical ones. In this paper we have considered closely one such set of variables: measures of ethnic, linguistic and religious fractionalization. Dealing with this type of variables raises two problems. One is measurement: how to measure ethnicity is a delicate and dif®cult matter. Moreover, the patterns of correlations between potential explanatory factors makes it dif®cult to unambiguously answer the question of why certain countries have better policies than others. In this paper we have made some progress on both fronts. First, on the measurement issue we provided a new set of fractionalization variables for a much larger sample of countries than was available before, and we put much effort into solving classi®cation issues using consistent criteria across countries. Second, using these new variables we revisited empirical issues concerning the determinants of growth and of quality of policies and institutions. We concluded that ethnic and linguistic fractionalization variables, more so than religious 182 ALBERTO ALESINA ET AL. ones, are likely to be important determinants of economic success, both in terms of output (GDP growth), other measures of welfare and policy quality (such as the literacy rate, infant mortality, etc.) and the quality of institutions (measured by the extent of corruption, political freedom, etc.). However, it is dif®cult to evaluate precisely the size of these effects because of the strong correlation of ethnolinguistic fractionalization variables with other potential explanatory variables, especially geographical ones. In the end one has to use theory and priors to interpret our partial correlations. 

Notes 

1. For a discussion of the political economy of borders, country size and heterogeneity of populations, see Alesina and Spolaore (2003). Note, however, that ethnic con¯ict was a constant in African history even before colonization, as pointed out by Herbst (2000). 2. See, for example, the general growth empirics exercises of Brock and Durlauf (2001), and Doppelhofer et al. (2000). 3. A partial list of papers in this area include Alesina et al. (1999), Alesina and La Ferrara (2000), Alesina and La Ferrara (2002), Lutmer (2001), Goldin and Katz (1999) and Costa and Kahn (2002). Another line of research has explored the effects of ethnic diversity on civil wars, suggesting that fractionalization does not help predict the incidence of domestic violent con¯ict once poverty and income levels are controlled for (see Fearon and Lattin, 2003). 4. See Glaeser et al. (2000). 5. Racial classi®cations follow the census which categorizes Americans into ®ve groups: Whites, Blacks, America Indians, Paci®c Islanders, and Hispanics. The country of origin, such as Ireland, Italy, Japan etc., is also available. 6. See http://www.stanford.edu/~wacziarg/papersum.html for our new dataset in electronic format, including the underlying groups structure of ethnicities, languages, and religions by country. Appendix 1 displays the fractionalization indices constructed from these data. 7. For the purpose of cross-country regressions, ELF was used, among many others, in Mauro (1995), Canning and Fay (1993) and Easterly and Levine (1997). 8. http://www.ethnologue.com/ 9. However, the Ethnologue data is much more disaggregated than the Encyclopedia Britannica data that we use, as relatively similar dialects are classi®ed there as different languages. 10. See, respectively, INSEE (2000), Israel Central Bureau of Statistics (2001), United States Census Bureau (2001) and Statistics New Zealand (2001). 11. See Hammersley and Atkinson (1995) for a survey of these concepts. The re¯exive school of thought, which seems to be associated with the postmodern tradition in sociology, is generally contrasted with the ``primordialist'' school, identi®ed for example with Geertz (1973), which is associated with evolutionist theories. 12. Mozzafar and Scarrit (1999) report data on ethnicity at three distinct levels of ``self-reference'' for Africa. We use their clan data for Somalia, since the rest of their dataset is suf®ciently close to our other sources. 13. The table is similar to Table 1 in Fearon (2002) to facilitate comparisons between his data and ours. 14. The coef®cient estimates on the other independent variables included in each speci®cation are available in the working paper version of this paper (Alesina et al., 2002) or from the authors upon request. 15. These authors present additional evidence precisely on this point using the data on ethnic fractionalization collected for the present paper. This is consistent with the fact that relatively homogeneous settler colonies like the US, Canada, New Zealand, and Australia had an easier time establishing democracy after independence than the more ethnically diverse former colonies in Latin America and Africa. 16. See, for instance, Garcia-Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2002). 17. A recent effort to generate an index of ``cultural distance'' appears in Fearon (2002). He noticed that linguists classify languages in treesÐtwo languages on the same branch of a linguistic tree are ``closer'' to each other FRACTIONALIZATION 183 than two languages on a different branch. Linguistic trees can therefore be used to approximate the distance between linguistic groups. Efforts to similarly measure the distance between ethnic groups and religions should be at the forefront of the data gathering effort in fractionalization research. We are not aware of such attempts. 18. The axioms imposed on polarization measures are the analogs of the Dalton Axioms for the measurement of inequality. See also Duclos et al. (2002) for a generalization. 19. Garcia-Montalvo and Reynal-Querol (2002) use the following speci®cation: POL i  1  Xni  10:5  si

0:5

 2

si:

They show that this index can be derived from a model of lobbying. Note that this index reaches a maximum of 1 when there are two equally sized groups in the country. 20. Esteban and Ray (1994) do not point to which value was ``better'' to capture polarizationÐall values of a in the speci®ed range satisfy the properties that the class of polarization measures should satisfy. There is therefore no a priori reason to prefer one value over the other. 21. Thus, in practice a measure based on a  0 does not add anything to our earlier results, so we abstain from commenting on the corresponding results. 22. Abegaz (2001), p. 207. 23. See Marcus (1994) on the complicated history of ethnic groups in Ethiopia.

Interference with the private sector 

Property rights index A rating of property rights in each country (on a scale of 1 to 5). The more protection private property receives, the higher the score. The score is based, broadly, on the degree of legal protection of private property, the extent to which the government protects and enforces laws that protect private property, the probability that the government will expropriate private property, and the country's legal protection to private property. Source: Holmes, Johnson, and Kirkpatrick, 1997 .149 Business Regulation index A rating of regulation policies related to opening a business and keeping open a business (on a scale of 1 to 5). Higher score means that regulations are straight-forward and applied uniformly to all businesses and that regulations are less of a burden to business.
