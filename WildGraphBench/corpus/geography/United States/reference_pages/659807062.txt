Manifest destiny and the expansion of America
=============================================

Authors: [Rodney P. Carlisle](https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=au=%22Carlisle%2C%20Rodney%20P.%22), [J. Geoffrey Golson](https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=au=%22Golson%2C%20J.%20Geoffrey%22)

Summary: "This volume poses "what if" questions about ten crucial "tipping points" in the history of U.S. expansionism between 1800 and the Civil War. It not only describes what happened?in the case of Lewis and Clark, the War of 1812, the Monroe Doctrine, railroads and telegraphs, the Mexican War, the gold rush, the Compromise of 1850?it also offers alternative scenarios, essays on what could have happened. In this exciting and imaginative approach to history, students not only develop analytical skills by tracing the causes and effects of crucial events; they are empowered by the knowledge that at moments when history hangs in the balance, many paths are possible, and that they, as citizens, can tip the scale."
