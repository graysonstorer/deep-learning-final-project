The GOP lawmaker, who has been vocal about his opposition to challenging the Electoral College results, slammed the demonstrators entering the Capitol.

“This is a coup attempt,” Kinzinger posted.

His tweet comes as the U.S. Capitol Police [locked down the Capitol building](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/532925-capitol-police-evacuate-madison-cannon-buildings) and evacuated multiple congressional buildings as the demonstrations became increasingly more violent.

Protesters [breached the Capitol building](https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/532854-live-coverage-pro-trump-protesters-gather-in-washington) shortly after 2 p.m., leading the House and the Senate to temporarily stop their debates on the Electoral College certification.

Vice President Pence was removed from the Senate amid the unrest. Lawmakers have been instructed to get down in their chairs, and the doors of the House chamber were locked.

He spoke earlier Wednesday at a protest and acknowledged that rallygoers were going to march toward the Capitol to encourage lawmakers not to certify the vote.

"I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically, make your voices heard today,"he said.
