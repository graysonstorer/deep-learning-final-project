WASHINGTON —From heavy artillery to tactical drones to armored vehicles, the U.S. has committed $5.6 billion in military aid to Ukraine since [Russia invaded](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/17/russia-ukraine-live-updates.html) in late February.

The latest assistance package of $1 billion, [which is the 12th installment of aid](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/15/biden-to-send-another-1-billion-in-military-aid-to-ukraine-.html), comes as Russian forces ramp up their fight in eastern and southern Ukraine.

The Pentagon said that the latest tranche of weapons announced on Wednesday is valued at $350 million. It includes 18 155 mm howitzers, 36,000 rounds of 155 mm ammunition,18 tactical vehicles to tow 155 mm howitzers, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HMARS, as well as four tactical vehicles to recover equipment and spare parts.

The Pentagon will also provide two Harpoon coastal defense systems, thousands of secure radios and night vision and thermal devices, along with funding for training and maintenance support. That aid is collectively valued at $650 million.

Here’s a look at the weapons the U.S. has committed to the fight thus far.

Heavy artillery platforms sit high on Ukrainian military wish lists. To date, the Pentagon has transferred 126 155 mm howitzer artillery systems from U.S. Army and U.S. Marine Corps stockpiles to Ukrainian forces.

Ukrainian troops will have to train alongside U.S. forces before they operate the howitzers. The Pentagon has previously said that the training will take place in a location outside of Ukraine, but near the country.

Along with the howitzers, the U.S. has also sent approximately 260,000 artillery rounds.

The Pentagon has also committed the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems, or HMARS, manufactured by defense giant [Lockheed Martin](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/LMT/). The HMARS are designed to shoot a variety of missiles from a mobile 5-ton truck.

The U.S. has also committed [at least 700 Switchblade drones](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/30/us-sends-100-killer-drones-called-switchblades-to-ukraine.html) manufactured by U.S.-based firm [AeroVironment](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/AVAV/). There are two variants of the weapon, the Switchblade 300 and 600. It was not immediately clear which version the U.S. deployed to Ukraine.

Each Switchblade is designed to be a single-use, or “kamikaze,” drone.

The 300 variant is designed to strike small targets. It can fit in a rucksack, weighs a little over 5 pounds and has a range of 10 miles. The 600 version of the weapon is designed to destroy tanks and other armored vehicles. It weighs slightly more than 120 pounds and has a range of more than 40 miles.

The Pentagon has also committed the Puma unmanned aerial system, or UAS, as well as 121 tactical unmanned aerial systems dubbed “Phoenix Ghost” drones.

In April, then-Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said those drones were “rapidly developed by the Air Force, in response, specifically to Ukrainian requirements.”

“It provides similar capabilities to the Switchblade series of unmanned systems, similar capabilities but not exact. There are other differences in the scope of capability for the Phoenix Ghosts, but I’m just not going to be able to get into more detail about those capabilities right now,” Kirby said during [an April 21 press briefing](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/21/us-sends-800-million-arms-package-to-ukraine.html).

The drones are manufactured by Aevex Aerospace in Solana Beach, California, and are currently in the U.S. Air Force arsenal. Once the drones are in the region, U.S. troops will train Ukrainian forces on how to operate them.

The U.S. has agreed to send 20 Mi-17 Russian military helicopters. Some of those were once slated to join Afghanistan’s military fleet before the stunning Taliban takeover of the country.

The Mi-17s are personnel transport helicopters that can be armed with cannons and rockets to perform attack or close air-support roles.

The U.S. military has also committed 22 of the highly mobile AN/TPQ-36 counter-artillery radars. This radar system is capable of locating mortars, artillery and rockets within a short range. The Pentagon has also sent four counter-mortar radars.

Four [Raytheon](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/RTX/) AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel air surveillance radars have also joined the fight in Ukraine. The Sentinel system is designed to alert front-line air defense weapons whenever it catches a glimpse of hostile planes, helicopters, drones or missiles.The U.S. has also included electronic jamming equipment.
