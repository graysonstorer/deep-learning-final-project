**country music**, style of [American](https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States)[popular music](https://www.britannica.com/art/popular-music) that originated in rural areas of [the South](https://www.britannica.com/place/the-South-region) and [West](https://www.britannica.com/place/the-West-region-United-States) in the early 20th century. The term _country and western music_ (later shortened to _country music_) was adopted by the recording industry in 1949 to replace the [derogatory](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/derogatory) label _hillbilly music_.

Ultimately, country music’s roots lie in the [ballads](https://www.britannica.com/art/ballad), [folk](https://www.britannica.com/art/folk-music) songs, and popular songs of the English, Scots, and Irish settlers of the [Appalachians](https://www.britannica.com/place/Appalachian-Mountains) and other parts of the South. It also drew from [minstrel](https://www.britannica.com/art/minstrel) and [vaudeville](https://www.britannica.com/art/vaudeville) traditions as well as African American [blues](https://www.britannica.com/art/blues-music), [gospel music](https://www.britannica.com/topic/gospel-music), and [Tin Pan Alley](https://www.britannica.com/art/Tin-Pan-Alley-musical-history) (a [genre](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/genre) of popular music that was centered on the song-publishing industry in [New York City](https://www.britannica.com/place/New-York-City) at the turn of the 20th century). In turn, country influenced (and was influenced by) many other types of [music](https://www.britannica.com/art/music), from regional [genres](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/genres) such as [Cajun](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Cajun), [zydeco](https://www.britannica.com/art/zydeco), and [Tejano](https://www.britannica.com/art/Tejano-music) to mainstream genres such as [rock](https://www.britannica.com/art/rock-music), [rap](https://www.britannica.com/art/rap), and trap.

Indeed, by the late 20th and early 21st centuries country was no longer a [musical expression](https://www.britannica.com/art/musical-expression)[exclusive](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/exclusive) to the South or even to the [United States](https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States). Contemporary country artists hailed from many other parts of the globe, from [Canada](https://www.britannica.com/place/Canada) to [New Zealand](https://www.britannica.com/place/New-Zealand) and [Australia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Australia). In the words of [Willie Nelson](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Willie-Nelson), one of the genre’s biggest stars, “It comes from the soul of America, but it has gone around the world.”

Beginnings in the 1920s
-----------------------

Country’s development was made possible partly by the invention of the [phonograph](https://www.britannica.com/technology/phonograph) and its ability to [record music](https://www.britannica.com/topic/music-recording). In the early 1920s the traditional string-band music of the Southern mountain regions began to be commercially recorded, with Fiddlin’ John Carson garnering the genre’s first hit record, featuring the songs “The Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane” and “The Old Hen Cackled and the Rooster’s Going to Crow,” in 1923. The vigor and realism of the rural songs, many lyrics of which were rather impersonal narratives of tragedies pointing to a stern [Calvinist](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Calvinism)[moral](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moral), stood in marked contrast to the often mawkish sentimentality of much of the popular music of the day.

More important than recordings for the growth of country music was broadcast [radio](https://www.britannica.com/topic/radio). Small radio stations appeared in the larger Southern and [Midwestern](https://www.britannica.com/place/Midwest) cities in the 1920s, and many devoted part of their airtime to live or recorded music suited to white rural audiences. Two regular programs of great influence were the _National Barn Dance_ from [Chicago](https://www.britannica.com/place/Chicago), begun in 1924, and the [_Grand Ole Opry_](https://www.britannica.com/event/Grand-Ole-Opry) from [Nashville](https://www.britannica.com/place/Nashville-Tennessee), begun in 1925. The immediate popularity of such programs encouraged more recordings and the appearance of talented musicians from the hills at radio and record studios. Among these were the [Carter Family](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Carter-family) and [Jimmie Rodgers](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jimmie-Rodgers), whose performances strongly influenced later musicians.

These early recordings were of ballads and [country dance](https://www.britannica.com/art/country-dance) tunes and featured the [fiddle](https://www.britannica.com/art/fiddle) and [guitar](https://www.britannica.com/art/guitar) as lead instruments over a rhythmic foundation of guitar or [banjo](https://www.britannica.com/art/banjo-musical-instrument). Other instruments occasionally used included the Appalachian [dulcimer](https://www.britannica.com/art/dulcimer), [harmonica](https://www.britannica.com/art/harmonica), and [mandolin](https://www.britannica.com/art/mandolin); vocals were done either by a single voice or in high close [harmony](https://www.britannica.com/art/harmony-music). Another common vocal feature was the [yodel](https://www.britannica.com/art/yodel), introduced by Rodgers and employed by new generations of singers, such as [LeAnn Rimes](https://www.britannica.com/biography/LeAnn-Rimes), into the 21st century.

Singing cowboys, Western swing, and honky-tonk
----------------------------------------------

With the migration of many Southern rural white workers and families to industrial cities during the [Great Depression](https://www.britannica.com/event/Great-Depression) (1929–c.1939) and [World War II](https://www.britannica.com/event/World-War-II) (1939–45), country music was carried into new areas and exposed to new influences, such as blues and gospel music. The nostalgic bias of country music, with its lyrics about grinding poverty, orphaned children, [bereft](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bereft) lovers, and lonely workers far from home, held special appeal during a time of wide-scale population shifts.

Despite this shift to the cities, early country music maintained an association with rural [stereotypes](https://www.britannica.com/topic/stereotype-social) of not only hill people and mountain folk but also [cowboys](https://www.britannica.com/topic/cowboy), farmers, miners, and [railroad](https://www.britannica.com/technology/railroad) workers. These mythical figures populated many songs of the genre, and some musicians tailored their image to align with audiences’ assumptions about rural life. Yet, authenticity underlay the image for many stars: [Merle Travis](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Merle-Travis), who wrote “Sixteen Tons” (1946), was a [coal miner](https://www.britannica.com/technology/coal-mining)’s son, and [Loretta Lynn](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Loretta-Lynn) was, famously, a coal miner’s daughter. During the 1930s a number of “singing cowboy” [film](https://www.britannica.com/art/film) stars, of whom [Gene Autry](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gene-Autry) was the best known, took country music and with suitably altered lyrics made it into [synthetic](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/synthetic) and adventitious “western” music. This western theme remained popular for decades, as with [Marty Robbins](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marty-Robbins)’s hit “El Paso” in 1959.

A second and more [substantive](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/substantive) variant of country music arose in the 1930s in the [Texas](https://www.britannica.com/place/Texas-state)-[Oklahoma](https://www.britannica.com/place/Oklahoma-state) region, where the music of rural white fiddle bands was exposed to the [swing](https://www.britannica.com/art/swing-music) jazz of Black orchestras and Mexican [mariachis](https://www.britannica.com/art/mariachi). In response, a [Western swing](https://www.britannica.com/art/Western-swing) style evolved in the hands of [Bob Wills](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bob-Wills) and others and came to feature [steel](https://www.britannica.com/art/steel-guitar) and amplified guitars and a strong dance [rhythm](https://www.britannica.com/art/rhythm-music). An even more important variant was [honky-tonk](https://www.britannica.com/art/honky-tonk-music), a country style that emerged in the 1940s with such figures as [Ernest Tubb](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ernest-Tubb) and [Hank Williams](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hank-Williams). Honky-tonk’s fiddle–steel-guitar combination and its bitter, [maudlin](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/maudlin) lyrics about rural folk adrift in the big city were widely adopted by other country musicians.

Bluegrass, the Nashville Sound, and the influence of rock and roll
------------------------------------------------------------------

[Bill Monroe](https://cdn.britannica.com/30/19230-050-2A307392/Bill-Monroe.jpg)Mandolin player and singer Bill Monroe created bluegrass in the 1940s. The music is notable for its “high lonesome” vocals and use of instruments such as the mandolin, fiddle, and banjo.

The same period saw a concerted effort to recover some of country music’s root values. Mandolin player [Bill Monroe](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bill-Monroe) and his string [band](https://www.britannica.com/art/band-music), the [Blue Grass Boys](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Blue-Grass-Boys), discarded more recently adopted rhythms and instruments and brought back the lead fiddle and high harmony [singing](https://www.britannica.com/art/singing). His banjoist, [Earl Scruggs](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Earl-Scruggs), developed a brilliant three-finger picking style that brought the instrument into a lead position. Their music, with its driving, syncopated rhythms and instrumental virtuosity, took the name “[bluegrass](https://www.britannica.com/art/bluegrass-music)” from Monroe’s band. The vocal style of bluegrass influenced [the Louvin Brothers](https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-Louvin-Brothers), a duo noted for their pure gospel-tinged sound and distinctive harmonies (also drawn from [shape-note singing](https://www.britannica.com/art/shape-note-singing)).

[The Hillbilly Shakespeare](https://cdn.britannica.com/77/67477-004-6D096044/Hank-Williams.jpg)Hank Williams was arguably country music's first superstar, with huge crossover success in popular music. Born in Alabama in 1923, Williams was given the nickname “the Hillbilly Shakespeare” because of his direct, emotionally honest lyrics and their poetic simplicity.

But commercialization proved a much stronger influence as country music became popular in all sections of the United States after World War II. In 1942 in [Nashville](https://www.britannica.com/place/Nashville-Tennessee)[Roy Acuff](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Roy-Acuff), one of the most important country singers, and songwriter [Fred Rose](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fred-Rose) organized the first publishing house for country music, the Acuff-Rose Publishing Company. A paramount signing was Hank Williams, whose catalog (including such hits as “Your Cheatin’ Heart,” the Cajun-inflected “Jambalaya,” and “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry”) would have a tremendous influence on country music. Williams’s meteoric rise to fame in the late 1940s helped establish Nashville as the undisputed center of country music, with large recording studios and the [Grand Ole Opry](https://www.britannica.com/event/Grand-Ole-Opry) as its chief performing [venue](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/venue).

In the 1950s and ’60s country music became a huge [commercial enterprise](https://www.britannica.com/money/business-organization). Producer [Chet Atkins](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Chet-Atkins) developed the so-called [Nashville Sound](https://www.britannica.com/topic/RCA-in-Music-City-USA-The-Nashville-Sound-1681059), a style in which many country music recordings employed lush orchestral backgrounds. At the same time, popular singers often recorded songs in a Nashville style.

There was considerable crossover between country and early [rock and roll](https://www.britannica.com/art/rock-and-roll-early-style-of-rock-music); the songs of [Elvis Presley](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Elvis-Presley), [Jerry Lee Lewis](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Jerry-Lee-Lewis), [Wanda Jackson](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Wanda-Jackson), and [Carl Perkins](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Perkins) (some of whom were labeled “[rockabilly](https://www.britannica.com/art/rockabilly)” performers) were played on country radio. [Chuck Berry](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Chuck-Berry) blended in country licks on his rock [compositions](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/compositions), particularly on his 1955 single “Maybellene.” Later, in the 1960s, [California](https://www.britannica.com/place/California-state)-based bands such as [the Byrds](https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-Byrds), [the Flying Burrito Brothers](https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-Flying-Burrito-Brothers) (led by Gram Parsons), and [Buffalo Springfield](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Buffalo-Springfield) ushered in [country rock](https://www.britannica.com/art/country-rock-music).

Modern country: From Patsy Cline to “Harper Valley P.T.A.”
----------------------------------------------------------

[Patsy Cline, c. 1956](https://cdn.britannica.com/24/197624-050-4EAFA6C5/Patsy-Cline-1956.jpg)Singer Patsy Cline had an exceptional contralto voice that lent itself to classic country hits such as “Sweet Dreams (of You)” and “Crazy.”

In [Patsy Cline](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Patsy-Cline) and [George Jones](https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Jones), country music found arguably its two greatest vocalists, both of whom were known for their unique phrasing and strong emotive abilities. Other leading performers of the era were [Tex Ritter](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tex-Ritter), Brenda Lee, Ray Price, [Kitty Wells](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kitty-Wells), [Johnny Cash](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johnny-Cash), [Buck Owens](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Buck-Owens), [Glen Campbell](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Glen-Campbell), and [Merle Haggard](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Merle-Haggard). Singing songs about social issues and giving voice to such [marginalized](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/marginalized) figures as prisoners, [Dust Bowl](https://www.britannica.com/place/Dust-Bowl) migrants, and Native Americans, Cash and Haggard (who had been incarcerated as a young man for various petty crimes) paved a way for the “[outlaw country](https://www.britannica.com/art/outlaw-music)” movement of the 1970s.

Ballads were popular on the country chart in the 1950s and ’60s. [Tennessee Ernie Ford](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tennessee-Ernie-Ford), Marty Robbins, [Lefty Frizzell](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lefty-Frizzell) were strong interpreters of songs centered on storytelling. Frizzell’s haunting murder ballad “The Long Black Veil” (1959) was one of the most influential examples of the form.

Other songwriters took the genre’s capacity for storytelling to new heights in the late 1960s. The 1967 hit “Ode to Billie Joe” by Bobbie Gentry famously leaves listeners hanging at the song’s end regarding the identity of an unnamed object thrown off the [Tallahatchie](https://www.britannica.com/place/Tallahatchie-River) Bridge. In 1968 Jeannie C. Riley’s chart-topping “Harper Valley P.T.A.” (written by [Tom T. Hall](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tom-T-Hall)) offered a miniature _Peyton Place_ (a [notorious](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/notorious) 1956 novel about small-town hypocrisy) in lyrical form; the song relates the story of single mother who confronts the gossips at her teenage daughter’s [Parent-Teacher Association](https://www.britannica.com/topic/National-Congress-of-Parents-and-Teachers) (PTA) junior-high-school meeting.

_An Interlude: “Listen to the Stories”_

[Legend](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Legend) has it that jazz saxophonist and composer [Charlie (“Bird”) Parker](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charlie-Parker) loved country music, especially its lyrics. When a fellow jazz musician asked him, “How can you stand that stuff?” Parker is said to have replied, “The stories, man. Listen to the stories.”

Breaking new ground for women and African American performers
-------------------------------------------------------------

[![Image 2: Queens of country music](https://cdn.britannica.com/44/275044-050-F62A3603/Lynn-Anderson-Dolly-Parton-Loretta-Lynn-Dottie-West-Tammy-Wynette-sing-at-CMA-Awards-1972.jpg?w=1000)](https://cdn.britannica.com/44/275044-050-F62A3603/Lynn-Anderson-Dolly-Parton-Loretta-Lynn-Dottie-West-Tammy-Wynette-sing-at-CMA-Awards-1972.jpg)

[Queens of country music](https://cdn.britannica.com/44/275044-050-F62A3603/Lynn-Anderson-Dolly-Parton-Loretta-Lynn-Dottie-West-Tammy-Wynette-sing-at-CMA-Awards-1972.jpg)Lynn Anderson (left), Dolly Parton, Loretta Lynn, Dottie West, and Tammy Wynette singing a medley at the County Music Association Awards, 1972.

Taking a cue from Cline and Wells, several female country artists came to the forefront, creating songs that reflected women’s perspectives. [Tammy Wynette](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tammy-Wynette), [Loretta Lynn](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Loretta-Lynn), and [Dolly Parton](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Dolly-Parton) were among those who were highly influential songwriters as well as distinctive vocalists. Their public image, featuring glamorous hairstyles and sequined dresses, also established an [indelible](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/indelible) style for country divas for generations. A hallmark of country style for both men and women during this era were Nudie suits, one-of-a-kind “[rhinestone](https://www.britannica.com/art/rhinestone) cowboy” creations designed by [Kyiv](https://www.britannica.com/place/Kyiv)-born tailor Nudie Cohn.

Country music in the 1960s was also marked by the success of groundbreaking African American country artists. Although there were Black country artists since the origin of the genre, it was not until the career of honky-tonk vocalist [Charley Pride](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Charley-Pride) that an African American singing star emerged. In 1967 he became the first Black solo singer to appear at the Grand Ole Opry. In 1969 [Linda Martell](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Linda-Martell) became the first Black female artist to perform there.Black performers in other genres also had significant success on the country chart; in 1962 [soul](https://www.britannica.com/art/soul-music) and [rhythm-and-blues](https://www.britannica.com/art/rhythm-and-blues) (R&B) singer and pianist [Ray Charles](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ray-Charles) released _Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music_, which sold more than a million copies, as did its single “I Can’t Stop Loving You.”

The outlaw movement and mainstream country music
------------------------------------------------

[Emmylou Harris](https://cdn.britannica.com/54/23154-050-197C245C/Emmylou-Harris.jpg)After starting out in folk music, Emmylou Harris contributed vocals to country-rock musician Gram Parsons's albums in the 1970s and went on to a successful country music career of her own.

The 1970s saw the growth of the [outlaw](https://www.britannica.com/art/outlaw-music) music of prominent Nashville expatriates [Willie Nelson](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Willie-Nelson) and [Waylon Jennings](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Waylon-Jennings). Before the outlaw movement, Nelson had written hits for other artists, the best-known being Patsy Cline’s “Crazy” in 1961. As a singer he innovated a distinctive [jazz](https://www.britannica.com/art/jazz)-style phrasing, unusual to country music. Other [seminal](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/seminal) outlaw artists were singer-songwriters [Kris Kristofferson](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kris-Kristofferson), Billy Joe Shaver, Townes Van Zandt, Jessi Colter, Tompall Glaser, and [Steve Earle](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Steve-Earle). Additionally, some former folk musicians, in particular [Gram Parsons](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gram-Parsons)’s former collaborator [Emmylou Harris](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Emmylou-Harris), successfully shifted their music to country in the 1970s.

Alongside the [innovations](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/innovations), traditional bands and performers remained popular, including vocals-based groups such as Alabama, Larry Gatlin and the Gatlin Brothers, and the [Oak Ridge](https://www.britannica.com/place/Oak-Ridge-Tennessee) Boys and contemporary singers such as [Anne Murray](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Anne-Murray) and [Kenny Rogers](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kenny-Rogers-American-singer-songwriter).

The gap between country and the mainstream of pop music continued to narrow in the 1970s and the next decade as [electric guitars](https://www.britannica.com/art/electric-guitar) (and electric fiddles, in the case of the Charlie Daniels Band) replaced more traditional instruments and country music became more acceptable to a national urban audience. Country retained its vitality into the late 20th century with such [diverse](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/diverse) performers as [George Strait](https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-Strait), [Randy Travis](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Randy-Travis), [Reba McEntire](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Reba-McEntire), Travis Tritt, [Faith Hill](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Faith-Hill), [the Judds](https://www.britannica.com/topic/the-Judds), Vince Gill, Dwight Yoakam, and [Lyle Lovett](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lyle-Lovett).

[Country superstars](https://cdn.britannica.com/44/198644-050-BE4A71D8/guitar-fiddle-country-music.jpg)Garth Brooks (left) and Ty England (right) performing with George Jones (center) at the Country Music Association Awards in 2001.

[Garth Brooks](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Garth-Brooks) was perhaps the most influential country star of this era, after the release his multimillion-selling album _No Fences_ (1990). Brooks’s concerts were huge productions modeled on stadium rock shows, and he also recorded songs that addressed topics such as [racism](https://www.britannica.com/topic/racism), [interracial relationships](https://www.britannica.com/topic/interracial-marriage-in-the-United-States), [gay rights](https://www.britannica.com/topic/gay-rights-movement), and [domestic abuse](https://www.britannica.com/topic/domestic-violence). Country’s popularity with mainstream audiences in the 1990s helped spawn a line-dancing craze, anchored by acts such as [Brooks & Dunn](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Brooks-and-Dunn) and [Billy Ray Cyrus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Billy-Ray-Cyrus).

However, some country purists objected to what they considered to be a focus on style over substance. There was a resurgence of bluegrass in the 1990s, led by fiddler and singer [Alison Krauss](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alison-Krauss) and her band Union Station. Nashville remained the center of country music, but other cities such as [Austin](https://www.britannica.com/place/Austin-Texas), Texas, and [Los Angeles](https://www.britannica.com/place/Los-Angeles-California) had [thriving](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/thriving)[alternative](https://www.britannica.com/art/alternative-rock) country scenes, and prominent recording artists emerged from other parts of the country and around the globe, including the U.S. Northeast (Mary Chapin Carpenter), Canada (Anne Murray, [k.d. lang](https://www.britannica.com/biography/k-d-lang), [Shania Twain](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Shania-Twain), and Cowboy Junkies), Ireland (Daniel O’Donnell), and Australia ([Olivia Newton-John](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Olivia-Newton-John), [Slim Dusty](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Slim-Dusty), and [Keith Urban](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Keith-Urban)). In [Mexico](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mexico) and the U.S. [Southwest](https://www.britannica.com/place/Southwest-region), [Tejano](https://www.britannica.com/art/Tejano-music) musicians increasingly incorporated country into their sound.

_An Interlude: Tejano_

[Tejano](https://www.britannica.com/art/Tejano-music) ([Spanish](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Spanish-language): “Texan”) is a type of Latin popular music that developed in northern Mexico and Texas in the mid-19th century. It blends traditional Mexican forms such as _norteño_ and _banda_ with swing music or European forms such as [polka](https://www.britannica.com/art/polka). Later Tejano musicians, such as singers Freddy Fender in the 1970s and [Selena](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Selena-American-singer) in the 1990s, introduced country, [disco](https://www.britannica.com/art/disco), and other kinds of music.

Country music politics
----------------------

By the end of the 20th century country was regarded by many audiences as being a music genre solely produced by and for working-class white Americans who held [conservative](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/conservative) political views. Earlier country musicians and fans, however, had often aligned with [populist](https://www.britannica.com/topic/populism) or [Democratic](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Democratic-Party) politics—for example, one of Fiddlin’ John Carson’s tunes was the protest song “The Farmer Is the Man That Feeds Them All.” In the 1960s some country alliances shifted to Republican candidates, and political statements began to show up in song lyrics. Among those who professed their views (whether liberal or conservative) were [Cash](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johnny-Cash), [Haggard](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Merle-Haggard), [Lynn](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Loretta-Lynn), Lee Greenwood, and David Allan Coe.

At the turn of the 21st century some country stars were even more outspoken in their views. During the buildup to the [Iraq War](https://www.britannica.com/event/Iraq-War) in 2003 the [Dixie Chicks](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dixie-Chicks) (later known as [the Chicks](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Dixie-Chicks)) received blowback, including being banned from some country radio stations, after lead singer [Natalie Maines](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Natalie-Maines) criticized U.S. Pres. [George W. Bush](https://www.britannica.com/biography/George-W-Bush) during a concert. A feud also ensued between the group and singer [Toby Keith](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Toby-Keith), who had released the patriotic “Courtesy of the Red, White, and Blue (The Angry American)” in the wake of the [September 11 attacks in 2001](https://www.britannica.com/event/September-11-attacks).

Diversifying in the 21st century

Country’s popularity was not [hindered](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/hindered) by its controversies, however, and its success continued unabated into the 21st century, exemplified by such performers as [Kenny Chesney](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kenny-Chesney), [Taylor Swift](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Taylor-Swift), [Brad Paisley](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Brad-Paisley), [Alan Jackson](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Alan-Jackson), [Blake Shelton](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Blake-Shelton), [Carrie Underwood](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carrie-Underwood), [Miranda Lambert](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Miranda-Lambert), the Zac Brown Band, [Sturgill Simpson](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sturgill-Simpson), [Brandi Carlile](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Brandi-Carlile), Luke Combs, and [Chris Stapleton](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Chris-Stapleton), among others.

Country also continued to diversify. Several African American artists, such as banjoist [Rhiannon Giddens](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Rhiannon-Giddens) and former Hootie & the Blowfish front man [Darius Rucker](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Darius-Rucker), redefined the traditional forms of bluegrass, Americana, and honky-tonk.

An invigorating new development was country-rap (and country-trap), a mash-up of country, [Southern rock](https://www.britannica.com/art/Southern-rock), and [hip-hop](https://www.britannica.com/art/hip-hop) music that resulted in an influx of crossover recording stars such as [Nelly](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Nelly), Jelly Roll, [Post Malone](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Post-Malone), Shaboozey, and Morgan Wallen. In 2019 the country-trap song “[Old Town Road](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Old-Town-Road)” by Lil Nas X and [Billy Ray Cyrus](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Billy-Ray-Cyrus) broke the record for the most consecutive weeks (19) a single had topped the _Billboard_ Hot 100 chart. In 2024 R&B singer [Beyoncé](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Beyonce) released the [Grammy Award](https://www.britannica.com/art/Grammy-Award)-winning album _[Cowboy Carter](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Cowboy-Carter)_, for which she [collaborated](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collaborated) with Dolly Parton and Linda Martell, among others, and became the first Black woman to top the country chart, with her single “Texas Hold ’Em.”

By 2025, when the venerable Grand Ole Opry celebrated its 100th anniversary, country music was being hailed as the fastest-growing music genre, especially on [streaming](https://www.britannica.com/topic/streaming-data-transmission) services. It was increasingly popular among younger audiences, whereas it was previously associated with older [demographics](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/demographics). Its fan base had also gone truly global, with high streaming numbers in the [United Kingdom](https://www.britannica.com/place/United-Kingdom), [Germany](https://www.britannica.com/place/Germany), and [Australia](https://www.britannica.com/place/Australia) and [niche](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/niche) audiences in [Japan](https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan), the [Philippines](https://www.britannica.com/place/Philippines), and [China](https://www.britannica.com/place/China). Despite its embrace by fans around the world, country music retained an unmistakable character as one of the few truly [indigenous](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/indigenous) American [musical](https://www.britannica.com/art/musical) styles.
