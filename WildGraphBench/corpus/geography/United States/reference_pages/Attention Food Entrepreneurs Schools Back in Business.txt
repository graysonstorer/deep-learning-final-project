Attention Food Entrepreneurs: School’s Back in Business
=======================================================

**[Bonnie Averbuch](https://foodtank.com/news/author/bonnie-averbuch/ "Posts by Bonnie Averbuch")**

The fall semester is in full swing and many students are enrolled in courses focused on food and agriculture. They realize that the food system is at a crossroads. Nearly a billion people suffer from hunger while at least 2.1 billion people are overweight or obese; 1.3 billion tons of food is wasted each year; and women and youth farmers and food workers are often discriminated against.![Image 24: https://ssl.gstatic.com/ui/v1/icons/mail/images/cleardot.gif](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/VxW61CQLYXmkA_V3Sy0n5kxQ_Dj4UO0h5RCflKzUUFYUQ0UVE9WusNHNqw6krkMECQVwE3tnjP8KDgDan9Z1mKHbs4QV9MISlh3e010DcuVLA5u2srphf2Jzp914jMihuoRrrSUWyT1CbC8A)

But the[movement to create a better food system](http://foodbusinessschool.org/courses/food-venture-lab-spring-2016/)has been growing and evolving. Food + Tech Connect recently reported that “over US$460 million of global investment {went} into the food tech and media space” this year. However, food often “attracts a lot of people who just want to go do it,” says Will Rosenzweig, Dean at The Food Business School (FBS). But it takes more than a good idea to create a successful food company; specialized training in business-related disciplines is a key component, too. That’s where[FBS](http://foodbusinessschool.org/)comes in.

FBS is the center for executive and graduate education of[The Culinary Institute of America](http://www.ciachef.edu/)(CIA). Rosenzweig has worked with “industry experts to create specialized programs that enable and empower entrepreneurs to design, deliver, and lead transformative innovations that address the world’s most pressing food challenges—and its greatest business opportunities.”

After just six months in operation, FBS is already receiving rave reviews. The “professors have such a wealth of knowledge, and it was an amazing opportunity to have them share some of it with us. Every single conversation led to revelations about our business and where we need to take it. And the networking was incredible,” according to Allison Arevalo, co-owner of Homeroom, a mac and cheese restaurant in Oakland, CA.

FBS offers a range of courses at locations throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, including five-week online courses, two-to-three-day innovation intensive workshops, and longer 10-to-15-week venture acceleration programs. The Fall 2015 program includes the online courses[Ethical Leadership in Food Business](http://foodbusinessschool.org/courses/ethical-leadership/)and[Food Venture Formation & Financing](http://foodbusinessschool.org/courses/food-venture-formation-financing/), the in-person[Scale Up Your (Authentic) Food Business](http://foodbusinessschool.org/courses/scale-up/)in Fort Mason, and the 15 week accelerator[Food Venture Lab](http://foodbusinessschool.org/courses/food-venture-lab-spring-2016/)in San Francisco.[Registration](http://foodbusinessschool.org/programs/)is now open for these courses.

Coursework is taught by some of the best and brightest in the food and business world, including Emilie Baltz, founder of the Food and Design Studio at Pratt Institute; Neil Grimmer, CEO and Co-founder of Plum Organics and Design Director at IDEO; Sarah Soule, a professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business; Nikki Silvestri, former director of People’s Grocery; and Don Buder, partner at Davis Wright-Tremaine LLC.

Many other schools are also offering courses to help food entrepreneurs and innovators.
