Relations between the U.S. and China are on a “dangerous” path with “no trust” on either side, political observers told CNBC.

Beijing regards Washington as “its primary adversary” and “believes the U.S. is intent on closing off the path of China,” said Stephen Roach, senior fellow at Yale University’s Paul Tsai China Center.

“Right now, there is no trust,” he told “[Squawk Box Asia](https://www.cnbc.com/asia-squawk-box/)” on Tuesday, who is currently attending the China Development Forum in Beijing.

William Cohen, former secretary of defense under the Clinton administration, underlined a similar sentiment and said the contentious back and forth between both sides has reached a “dangerous” level.

“I think it’s very dangerous whenever you have two competing powers, and nuclear weapons in the hands of both powers — that’s a very dangerous place to be,” Cohen,now chairman and CEO of the Cohen Group, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia” on Monday.

In early March,[China’s new foreign minister Qin Gang,](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/07/chinas-new-foreign-minister-qin-gang-holds-first-press-briefing.html) said relations with the U.S. have left a “rational path” and warned of conflict if Washington doesn’t “hit the brake.”

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tensions between the U.S and China have been rising over the years, ranging from trade and tariffs to tech rivalry and alleged spying.

More recently,things escalated again after the U.S. shot down an alleged Chinese spy balloon. This triggered Secretary of State Antony [Blinken to cancel his trip to Beijing](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/03/us-secretary-of-state-blinken-postpones-high-stakes-trip-to-china-after-us-discovers-suspected-spy-balloon-.html) over the incident last month.

“The balloon was a spark that really put us on a swift downhill descent,” Roach added. “If a balloon can derail this relationship the way it did so swiftly, it just tells you how damaged and distrustful the two nations are of this relationship.”

China and the U.S. have also been sparring over other contentious issues.

Washington was “very concerned that[China’s considering providing lethal support](https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/blinken-china-is-strongly-considering-providing-lethal-assistance-to-russia-163644997696)” to Russia in its war against Ukraine. Issues over Taiwan have also drawn China’s anger, with Beijing consistently warning that[Taiwan is the “first red line”](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.globaltimes.cn/page/202211/1279456.shtml__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!si04a8Y0g9JHtfrTUKyCZBhchB-VqJucE0NqAoxeiglEYYVrkCmvKCkRo3Tgnz6KHxuMJvkLXWboxu48VHqhB8Nu$)that must not be crossed.

“I just have been in China now for five days and the story here is the mirror image of what you pick up in the U.S.,” Roach said. “China is absolutely convinced they have an American problem.”

He added: “I’ll go back tonight to the U.S. and I’ll hear the exact opposite — that America has a China problem.”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last week, the CEO of China-owned social media app [TikTok, spent hours testifying](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/23/tiktok-ceo-grilled-by-lawmakers-from-both-parties-over-china-ties.html)to U.S. lawmakers, who wanted to know if American data could fall into the hands of the Chinese government.

There was “a lot of discussion” around the issue at the China Development Forum, said Roach.

“The videos of that appearance really went viral,” he noted. “It really is something that I would say the Chinese experts, officials, and business people that I spoke with at the [forum] found very offensive and made them very worried.”

Historically, when you have two competing powers rising, it often leads to conflict “on a majority of occasions,” Cohen warned.

Beijing is fast becoming a global economic power that is closely competing with Washington on several fronts, according to him.

China has amassed an “amazing amount of weaponry that they developed in a very short period of time. Their economy, I think, is quite solid throughout the world,” Cohen said.

The relationship is “going to get harder,” he noted, who stressed that both sides need to engage to avoid misunderstanding or miscalculation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is potential for tensions to flare up again after[Taiwan’s office of the president](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/english.president.gov.tw/NEWS/6462__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!rvZglY1_pTQH3CwCKk9KSuGy2LnEUPtaJEkoVr8nIyP6o-Js7mFx2c5ABhjTP5Z4Eo6ozXdnsyAH7aQumIvCS4xY$)confirmed last week that Tsai Ing-wen is scheduled to transit through New York and Los Angeles at the end of March during her visit to Guatemala and Belize. The office did not provide details of her itinerary while in the U.S.

On Taiwan, China has repeatedly said the issue is an internal affair. Beijing claims that the self-governed island is part of its territory, and maintains that Taiwan should have no right to conduct foreign relations.

The Biden administration has been keen to downplay the Taiwan president’s transit, calling it “not uncommon.”

“President Tsai has done it six times. Every single Taiwan president in recent memory has done this,” White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby, said at a[press briefing last week](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https:/www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/press-briefings/2023/03/21/press-briefing-by-press-secretary-karine-jean-pierre-and-nsc-coordinator-for-strategic-communications-john-kirby-10/__;!!PIZeeW5wscynRQ!rvZglY1_pTQH3CwCKk9KSuGy2LnEUPtaJEkoVr8nIyP6o-Js7mFx2c5ABhjTP5Z4Eo6ozXdnsyAH7aQumBGe3X3I$).

“There’s no reason for China to overreact. Heck, there’s no reason for them to react.I mean, this is something that ... is commonplace and has happened before, will likely happen again. It’s personal. It’s unofficial,” he added.

Both countries are “equally guilty and mismanaging their relationship,” said Roach. Washington needs to figure out its intentions toward Beijing, he added.

“How far are we prepared to go?” he asked**.**“If there’s ever been a time to focus on resolving a dysfunctional relationship that time is right now,” said Roach.

Residents (or authorized agents) of states listed in the “Your Rights” section of our Privacy Policy: You are opted out of targeted advertising, selling, or sharing, occurring on this site, for this browser and device. We received your election through our toggle or a universal opt-out preference signal. You can change your choice any time.

You should also provide the information requested in this Opt-Out Form, which will enable us to take action on your opt-out election more broadly than just this site (e.g., we will be able to stop sharing your email with third parties in order to target you with adverting on other sites and services, like social media platforms, such as social media platforms).

Residents (or authorized agents) of states not listed in the “Your Rights” section of our Privacy Policy: If we do not detect that you are in one of the states listed in the “Your Rights” section of our Privacy Policy, we cannot ensure that we will be able to apply your opt out choice, even if you utilize the toggle or we receive your election through your universal opt-out preference signal.

Notice of Right to Opt-Out of Sale/Sharing and Targeted Advertising
-------------------------------------------------------------------

We may collect personal data from and about you through this site for “targeted advertising,” “selling,” or “sharing,” as defined by applicable privacy laws.

See the “[Your Rights](https://www.versantprivacy.com/privacy#accordionheader5)” section of our Privacy Policy for more info.

**If you reside in one of these states (or are an authorized agent) you can opt out of targeted advertising, selling, or sharing, occurring on this site by moving the toggle below to the left and clicking “Confirm My Choice.”** Your choice through the toggle is specific to this site. If you access other Versant sites and services, you will need to opt out for each. Also, if you clear your cookies on this browser or use another browser or device, you will need to opt out again. You can change your choice any time.

You may also enable where available and provided for under applicable privacy laws, a universal tool that automatically communicates your opt out preference, such as the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”). If detected, we will process your GPC signal as if you had opted out through the toggle.

If you opt-out, you may continue to see advertising, including ads that may be based on personal information processed before you opted out.
