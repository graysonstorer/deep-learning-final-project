The White House announced on Christmas Eve President Joe Biden signed a bill officially designating the bald eagle as the national bird.

[The bill](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/12/24/press-release-bill-signed-hr-663/), signed Monday after being passed unanimously by Congress, amends Title 36 of the United States Code, officially appointing the predator one of the country's national symbols.

Congress [passed the bill](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/4610/all-actions?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22bald+eagle%22%7D&s=1&r=2&overview=closed#tabs) unanimously.

[**SENATE PASSES BILL TO STOP SHUTDOWN, SENDING IT TO PRESIDENT BIDEN'S DESK**](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-passes-bill-stop-shutdown-sending-president-bidens-desk)

The bald eagle, which has been featured on the [Great Seal](https://diplomacy.state.gov/the-great-seal/) of the United States since 1782 and has its own holiday and [protection act](https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/bald-eagle-brief-history-great-conservation-success-story-americas-bird), was never technically assigned the title of "national bird."

[**BIDEN ADMIN OFFICIALS NOTICED STAMINA ISSUES IN PRESIDENT’S FIRST FEW MONTHS IN OFFICE: REPORT**](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-officials-noticed-stamina-issues-presidents-first-few-months-office-report)

It was, however, designated as the national emblem by the [U.S. Congress](https://www.foxnews.com/category/us/congress) in 1782, according to [USA.gov.](https://www.usa.gov/flag#:~:text=The%20bald%20eagle%20was%20designated,eagle%20%5BPDF%2C%2066KB%5D.) In addition to its appearance on the Great Seal, it is featured on official documents, the presidential flag, military insignia, and currency.

A document previously published by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to [VA.gov](https://www.va.gov/opa/publications/celebrate/eagle.pdf) improperly noted the bird as the [national bird](https://www.foxnews.com/video/6321952287112).

"Thank you to Senators Klobuchar, Lummis, Mullin and Smith, and Representatives Finstad, Craig and Emmer for their leadership," the White House wrote in a statement Tuesday announcing the signing of the bill.
