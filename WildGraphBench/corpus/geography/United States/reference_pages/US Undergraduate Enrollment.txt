Between fall 2010 and fall 2021, total undergraduate enrollment in degree-granting postsecondary institutions decreased by 15 percent (from 18.1 million to 15.4 million students). However, between fall 2021 and fall 2031, total undergraduate enrollment is projected to increase by 9 percent to 16.8 million students.

In fall 2021, total undergraduate enrollment in degree-granting[1](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cha#fn1) postsecondary institutions in the United States[2](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cha#fn2) was 15.4 million[3](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cha#fn3) students, 3 percent lower than in fall 2020 (15.9 million students). This continued the downward trend in undergraduate enrollment observed before the coronavirus pandemic. Overall, undergraduate enrollment was 15 percent lower in fall 2021 than in fall 2010, with 42 percent of this decline occurring during the pandemic. In contrast, total undergraduate enrollment is projected to increase by 9 percent (from 15.4 million to 16.8 million students) between 2021 and 2031.[4](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cha#fn4)

In fall 2021, female students made up 58 percent of total undergraduate enrollment (8.9 million students), and male students made up 42 percent (6.5 million students). Between 2010 and 2021, male enrollment decreased by 17 percent (from 7.8 million to 6.5 million students) and female enrollment decreased by 13 percent (from 10.2 million to 8.9 million students). Over this period, male enrollment saw its largest single-year decline in fall 2020 (7 percent), while female enrollment saw its largest single-year decline in fall 2021 (3 percent). In contrast, between 2021 and 2031, female and male enrollment are both projected to increase by 9 percent (to 9.7 and 7.1 million students, respectively). [Time series ][Sex or gender][Projections]

See _Digest of Education Statistics 2022_, table [303.70](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d22/tables/dt22_303.70.asp).

In fall 2021, undergraduate enrollment varied by control of institution (i.e., public, private nonprofit, or private for-profit):

*   11.9 million students (77 percent) were enrolled at public institutions;
*   2.7 million students (18 percent) were enrolled at private nonprofit institutions; and
*   777,400 students (5 percent) were enrolled at private for-profit institutions. 

Between fall 2010 and fall 2021, enrollment in private for-profit institutions decreased by 55 percent (from 1.7 million to 777,400 students), and enrollment in public institutions decreased by 13 percent (from 13.7 million to 11.9 million students). Meanwhile, enrollment in private nonprofit institutions was higher in 2021 than in 2010 but showed no consistent trend throughout this period. Compared with enrollment in fall 2020, enrollment in fall 2021 was 3 percent lower at private for-profit institutions and public institutions and 1 percent lower at private nonprofit institutions. [Time series ][Control of institution]

Retention rates measure the percentage of first-time undergraduate students who return to the same institution the following fall. Among the 2 million first-time, full-time degree-seeking undergraduate students who entered degree-granting institutions in fall 2020 (about 12 percent of all undergraduate students), the overall retention rate in fall 2021 was 76 percent. Retention rates in fall 2021 were higher at private nonprofit institutions (81 percent) than at public institutions (75 percent) or private for-profit institutions (62 percent).

In fall 2021, the 10.8 million students enrolled in 4-year institutions made up 70 percent of total undergraduate enrollment; the remaining 30 percent (4.7 million students) were enrolled in 2-year institutions. Between 2010 and 2021, enrollment

*   decreased by 39 percent at 2-year institutions (from 7.7 million to 4.7 million students); and
*   increased by 4 percent at 4-year institutions (from 10.4 million to 10.8 million students).

However, enrollment at 4-year institutions was 2 percent lower in fall 2021 than in fall 2020 or fall 2019. [Time series ][Level of institution ]

By 2031, undergraduate enrollment in 4-year institutions is projected to increase by 7 percent (from 10.8 to 11.6 million students) and enrollment in 2-year institutions is projected to increase by 12 percent (from 4.7 million to 5.3 million students). [Time series ][Level of institution ][Projections]

Distance education uses one or more technologies to deliver instruction to students who are separated from the instructor and to support regular and substantive interaction between the student and the instructor synchronously or asynchronously. Technologies used for instruction may include the following: the internet; one-way and two-way transmissions through open broadcasts, closed circuit, cable, microwave, broadband lines, fiber optics, satellite, or wireless communication devices; audio conferencing; and videocassettes, DVDs, and CD-ROMs, only if the videocassettes, DVDs, and CD-ROMs are used in a course in conjunction with the technologies listed above.

Distance education[6](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cha#fn6) courses and programs provide students with flexible learning opportunities. In fall 2021, some 9.4 million students, or 61 percent of all undergraduate students, were enrolled in at least one distance education course. Some 4.4 million students, or 28 percent of all undergraduate students, took distance education courses exclusively. As a percentage of total undergraduate enrollment in fall 2021, participation in distance education was lower than in fall 2020,[7](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cha#fn7) the first fall of the coronavirus pandemic, but remained higher than fall 2019. Specifically, the percentage of undergraduate students enrolled in at least one distance education course was

*   36 percent in 2019;
*   75 percent in 2020; and
*   61 percent in 2021.

The percentage of undergraduate students who took distance education courses exclusively was

*   15 percent in 2019;
*   44 percent in 2020; and
*   28 percent in 2021.

[Time series ][Distance education]

Of the undergraduate students who took distance education courses exclusively, 3.2 million (74 percent) were enrolled in institutions located in the same state in which they resided and 1.0 million (23 percent) were enrolled in institutions in a different state.[8](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cha#fn8)[Distance education]

In fall 2021, the percentage of undergraduate students who took distance education courses exclusively varied by control of the institution at which those students were enrolled. Specifically, those who were enrolled in distance education courses exclusively made up

*   58 percent of students at private for-profit institutions;
*   28 percent of students at public institutions; and
*   21 percent of students at private nonprofit institutions.

In particular, the percentage of students who took distance education courses exclusively was highest at private for-profit 4-year institutions (71 percent). Despite enrolling only 4 percent of undergraduates, private for-profit 4-year institutions accounted for 10 percent of undergraduates who were enrolled exclusively in distance education courses.
