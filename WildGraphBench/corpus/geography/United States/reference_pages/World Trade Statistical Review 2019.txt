This publication has been prepared under the direction of Robert Koopman, Director of the Economic Research and Statistics Division, and Andreas Maurer, Chief of the International Trade Statistics Section. The coordination of the report was undertaken by Ninez Piezas-Jerbi. Statistical research, data compilation and the preparation of estimates were conducted by Barbara d’Andrea-Adrian, Alejandra Barajas Barbosa, Lori Chang, Christophe Degain, Florian Eberth, Antonella Liberatore, Kathryn Lundquist, Coleman Nee, Ninez Piezas-Jerbi and Ying Yan with the assistance of  Sonia Bouali and Carlo Gambaré. Contributions to this publication were also provided by the WTO’s Aid for Trade Unit, the Market Access Division, the Market Access Intelligence Section, the Economic Research Group and the Trade Monitoring Section of the Trade Policies Review Division. The International Trade Statistics Section also wishes to thank colleagues from the Information and External Relations Division (IERD) and the Languages Documentation and Information Management Division (LDIMD) whose collaboration is vital in the production of this report. In particular, recognition is due to Anthony Martin, Serge Marin-Pache and Steve Cooper in IERD and  to the French and Spanish translators in LDIMD. Finally, we wish to thank the users of WTO statistics for their constructive suggestions on how to improve our statistical output. This regular feedback allows us to constantly refine the data we provide. World Trade Statistical Review 2019 

4A me s s age f rom D i rec tor- G eneral Rob er to A z evêdo At a time of great uncertainty for global trade, the role of trade statistics takes on a renewed significance. Governments need the latest data to take informed decisions and to determine the best direction of trade policy for the benefit of the people they represent. The WTO’s data-gathering role plays a big part in meeting this need. 

World merchandise trade grew by 3.0 per cent in 2018, slightly exceeding GDP. This was significantly lower than the 4.6 per cent growth recorded in 2017. This loss of momentum is partly due to increasing trade tensions and historically high levels of trade restrictions. The WTO’s latest trade monitoring report confirms that trade-restrictive measures are on the rise. Trade covered by import-restrictive measures recorded in the last trade monitoring report (mid-October 2018 to mid-May 2019) is estimated at US$ 339.5 billion. This is the second-highest figure on record, after the US$ 588.3 billion reported in the previous report (mid-October 2017 to mid-October 2018). If trade is to pick up in 2019-20, trade tensions must be resolved. Trade continues to be concentrated. The ten leading traders in 2018 represented more than half of world trade, with the top five accounting for around 37 per cent of global transactions. Developing economies are playing an increasingly important role in world trade, with significant increases in their rankings among the world’s leading exporters and importers. There are also increasing levels of trade between developing economies. In 2018, this represented over 50 per cent of their merchandise exports. However, the merchandise exports of the least-developed countries remained at a meagre US$ 193 billion, representing less than 1 per cent of world exports. In nominal terms, high energy prices contributed to growth in merchandise exports in 2018. Exports of fuels and mining products grew by 23 per cent while manufactured goods and agricultural products grew by 8 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. Overall, merchandise exports grew by 10.0 per cent, down from 10.7 per cent in 2017. In contrast, world trade in commercial services grew by 8 per cent, recording strong growth for the second consecutive year. Goods-related services registered the strongest expansion, at 11 per  cent, while the weakest growth was in transport services. Worldwide networks for the production of goods continue to grow in importance, with developing economies playing an increasing role. Asian economies have become major players in global value chains. Viet Nam and the Philippines have seen growth in GVC participation while for Singapore over 60 per cent of its trade involves exchanges among GVCs. While this publication sheds light on the latest trends in trade, the increasing use of new technologies and online transactions begs the question as to whether we have the right data to measure these trends. Are existing trade statistics and product classifications up-to-date for quantifying and identifying emerging products and services? As technology has helped to create new business models and products, it is essential that these are sufficiently captured. The WTO is currently working in collaboration with national and international authorities, the private sector, consumers and academia to increase our understanding of this area. I would like to thank everyone who has worked on this report. We hope it provides useful insights into world trade for WTO members and all those involved in trade analysis.

6World Trade Statistical Review 2019 11 7World mercha nd i s e t rade i n 2018 The volume of world merchandise trade, as measured by the average of exports and imports, grew by 3.0 per cent in 2018, just above the 2.9 per cent increase in world GDP over the same period. US$ 19.67 trillion Value of world merchandise trade in 2018 US$ 193 billion Merchandise exports of least-developed countries in 2018 Clothing Clothing was the most dynamic product among manufactured goods, with an increase of 3.3 per cent in 2018. Me rc ha nd i s e t rade 

## The value of merchandise trade increased by 10  per  cent in 2018. The increase in exports was mostly driven by high energy prices while Asia was the main contributor to an increase in global imports. World merchandise exports of fuels and mining products, manufactured goods and agriculture grew by 23 per cent, 8 per cent and 5 per cent respectively. Developing economies exported a total of US$ 8,779 billion in 2018, of which US$ 193 billion were from least-developed countries.

## Information and communication technology recorded the highest export growth (15 per cent) among services sectors in 2018, led by  computer services. Growth in exports of commercial services was highest in the Commonwealth of Independent States (12 per cent) in 2018, partly due to the FIFA World Cup in Russia. China was the leading exporter of commercial services (by value) among developing countries, with exports increasing by 17% in  2018.

## World trade and GDP slowed in 2018 as trade tensions increased 

World trade faced renewed headwinds in 2018 as trade tensions and economic policy uncertainty rose sharply. Year-on-year growth in the volume of world merchandise trade fell from 3.9 per cent in the first half of 2018 to 2.7 per cent in the second half of the year. The slowdown became more pronounced towards the end of the year, as relatively strong quarter-on-quarter growth of 1.2 per cent in the third quarter was followed by a decline of 0.3 per cent in the fourth quarter. Slower trade growth was accompanied by weaker output growth in major economies. For example, G20 countries saw their collective GDP increase at an average year-on-year rate of 3.5 per cent in the second half of 2018, down from 3.9 per  cent in the first half. The loss of momentum in trade and GDP is partly due to tighter monetary policy, increased financial volatility and the raising of tariffs on widely traded goods in major economies. Trade tensions appear to have contributed significantly to the  slowdown. Overall trade growth of 3.0 per cent in 2018 was significantly lower than the 4.6 per cent growth recorded in 2017. This strong growth had suggested a return to the stronger pace of  trade expansion that characterized the late 1990s and early 2000s but this was not sustained in 2018. Trade only grew slightly more than output in 2018 after being 1.6 times higher in 2017 (see Chart 3.1). However, trade growth remained above the 2.6 per cent average rate since 2008. 

## Differences by region and level of development 

The slowdown in the growth of merchandise trade volume in 2018 was broad-based, re fl ecting weaker import and export shipments globally, although some country groupings were more affected by the slowdown than others. Weaker trade growth was most evident in the fourth quarter of 2018, when export volumes declined by 0.1 per cent and import volumes dropped 0.5 per cent (see Chart 3.2). On the export side, the slowdown was mostly due to reduced shipments from developed countries, which contracted year-on-year in three out of the four quarters of 2018. On the import side, developed countries recorded slow growth throughout the year, particularly in the first half. Meanwhile, developing economies and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) saw imports fall 2.1 per cent in the final quarter of 2018 despite stronger growth earlier in the year.

The overall deceleration of trade in 2018 was driven primarily by Europe and Asia due to their large share in world imports (37 per cent and 35 per cent, respectively). After recording relatively strong growth up to the third quarter of 2018, Asia saw its imports fall 1.9 per cent in Q4 compared with the previous quarter (see Chart 3.3). Meanwhile, Europe’s imports declined more gradually, with a drop of 1.3 per cent year-on-year in Q4. In North America, a buoyant US economy contributed to strong growth in imports, which were up 4.0 per cent year-on-year in Q4. “Other regions”, encompassing Africa, the Middle East and the CIS, recorded slow but steady growth in imports. South America’s imports continued to recover up to Q3 but were buffeted by uncertainty in Q4. Exports of all regions were weaker in Q4 than in Q3, with quarter-on-quarter declines of 0.8 per cent and 0.4 per  cent, respectively, in North America and Europe. Meanwhile, shipments from Asia were only up 0.3 per cent quarter-on-quarter in Q4 after rising 1.8 per cent in Q3.

## Higher oil prices lifted merchandise trade values in 2018 

Nominal trade values rose in 2018 due to a combination of volume and price changes. World merchandise exports totalled US$ 19.48 trillion, an increase of 10 per cent from the previous year. The rise was partly due to higher oil prices, which were up roughly 20 per cent for the whole of 2018. However, oil prices fell 25 per cent between October and December as negative economic news and economic uncertainty reduced expected demand for energy in the near future (see Chart 3.4). Heightened trade tensions cannot be the only cause of the trade slowdown in 2018 but they undoubtedly played a significant role as slower trade growth coincided with announced or anticipated trade actions, such as tariff raising, by governments. Trade and output were also in fl uenced by temporary shocks, such as the federal government shutdown in the United States and production problems in the automotive sector in Germany towards the end of the year. These incidents were likely to have transitory effects, causing consumers and businesses to postpone purchases and production decisions rather than cancelling them outright. Exchange rates probably had a minimal impact on nominal trade values in US dollar terms in 2018. Despite  fl uctuations over the course of the year, the value of the US dollar was little changed between 2017 and 2018. The nominal effective exchange rate of the US dollar against a broad basket of currencies was only down 1.0 per cent year-on-year (see Chart 3.5).

(Annual percentage change) 3.0% World merchandise trade volume slowed to 3 per cent in 2018 following 4.6 per cent growth in 2017. Europe and Asia contributed most to slowing merchandise trade growth in 2018 

All regions recorded increased exports in 2018, both in terms of volume and US dollar values. The same was true on the import side, with the sole exception of the Middle East, whose imports were down 3.3 per cent in volume terms but up 0.9 per cent in current US dollar terms. Import volumes increased by 5.0 per cent in both North  America and Asia. In the case of North America, this represented an acceleration from 4.0 per cent the previous year, while in Asia’s case it marked a deceleration from 8.3 per cent in 2017. European import volume growth was sluggish, slowing to 1.0 per cent in 2018 from 2.9 per cent in 2017. Import volumes in South and Central America continued to recover from their steep decline between 2014 and 2016, with an increase of 5.2 per cent in 2018. Other regions collectively recorded weak import growth of 0.5 per cent (see Table 3.1). The region with the highest yearly export growth in volume terms was the Commonwealth of Independent States at 4.9 per  cent, followed by North America at 4.3 per cent. Asia’s export volume growth slowed from 6.8 per cent in 2017 to 3.8 per cent in 2018 while South and Central America stagnated with an increase of just 0.6 per cent. Other regions taken together recorded a moderate 2.7 per cent increase in export volumes. The large shares of Europe and Asia in world merchandise exports and imports give these regions an outsized in fl uence on global trade growth. With exports valued at US$ 7.11 trillion and imports at US$ 7.15 trillion in 2018, Europe accounted for 37 per cent of world merchandise trade on both the export and import side. Asia’s exports of US$ 6.91 trillion gave it a 34 per cent share while its imports of US$ 6.76 trillion accounted for 33 per cent of the world total. North America’s exports and imports of US$ 2.56 trillion and US$ 3.56 trillion accounted for shares of 14 per cent and 18 per cent in world exports and imports, respectively. a Average of exports and imports. b Other regions comprise Africa, the Middle East and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), including associate and former member states. Sources: WTO Secretariat for trade, consensus estimates for GDP. Despite their weak export volume growth, the oil-rich regions of Africa, the Middle East and the Commonwealth of Independent States saw their export revenues surge in 2018, with increases of 13 per cent, 21 per cent and 24 per cent respectively in the US$ value of their exports. Major economies saw year-on-year growth in the US$ value of their trade  fl ows drop sharply over the course of 2018 and into 2019 (see Chart 3.6). A recovery in trade growth may depend on an easing of global trade tensions. 2015 2016 2017 2018

World trade in commercial services trade recorded solid growth for the second consecutive year, rising by 8 per cent in 2018 (see Chart 3.7). Goods-related services registered the strongest expansion, with a 10.6 per cent increase in current dollar terms. The weakest growth was in transport, which still increased by 7.1 per cent. Chart 3.7 

Growth in the value of commercial services exports by category, 2014-18 

(Annual percentage change) Source: WTO-UNCTAD-ITC estimates. Quarterly developments show divergent trends across countries, particularly in the second half of 2018 (see Chart 3.8). In the fourth quarter of 2018, China and India continued to record strong year-on-year growth in export values (+12.9 per cent and +12.5 per cent, respectively) while other economies saw exports stagnate (growth of 0 per cent for EU  trade with partners outside the EU) or decline (-4.5 per cent for Japan, -2.4 per cent for Brazil). A similar pattern is visible for imports, with China and India maintaining strong growth and other countries weakening. The fact that currencies such as the dollar, the euro and the yen were relatively stable during this period suggests that these developments re fl ect real changes in activity rather than  changes in prices. The category of “other commercial services”, which includes financial services and other business services, contributes disproportionately to services trade growth.

(Year-on-year percentage change) Source: WTO-UNCTAD-ITC estimates. Year-on-year growth in EU exports of other commercial services outside the EU slowed to 0 per cent in Q4 of 2018 after recording double-digit increases earlier in the year (15 per cent in Q1 and 10 per cent in Q2). Exports of other commercial services from the United States slowed less dramatically, from 7 per cent in Q1 to 3 per cent in Q4. Japan’s exports of other commercial services contracted by 4 per cent in Q4 while China’s exports of commercial services increased by 19 per cent in the final quarter of the year. Most services trade is not directly affected by trade measures targeting goods but the economic uncertainty generated by these actions can still have an impact by discouraging businesses from engaging with new clients and from spending funding on services. An easing of trade tensions would probably help to give a boost to services trade.

## Leading indicators point to weaker trade growth in first half of 2019 

A number of leading economic indicators and trade statistics suggest continued weakness in trade and output in the first half of 2019. Year-on-year growth in monthly merchandise exports and imports, shown in Chart 3.6, remained depressed up to March. In March, the dollar value of exports from the United States, the European Union and Japan were down 1 per cent, 7 per cent and 7 per cent respectively. China’s exports were up 14 per cent over the previous year but the increase was mostly due to a weak performance in March 2018. Imports also stalled, with no growth (0 per cent) in the United States and declines of 2 per cent, 4 per cent and 8 per cent in the European Union, Japan and China respectively. Part of the decline may be due to  lower oil prices in 2019 compared with 2018. Purchasing managers’ indices (PMIs), based on business surveys, are an early indicator of economic activity. The Global Manufacturing PMI compiled by IHS-Market and JPMorgan dipped to 50.3 in April 2019, just above the threshold value of 50, indicating expansion. This suggests that economic growth will remain weak into the second quarter of 2019. The PMI reading for the United States was relatively strong (52.6) but the value for the euro area (47.9) was weak, indicating contraction. China’s PMI of 50.2 suggests steady if somewhat sluggish growth. Overall, these indices paint a mixed picture of the global economy, with some countries growing faster than others. The new export orders component of the Global PMI is a reliable leading indicator of merchandise trade volume. This index, shown in Chart 3.9, continued to indicate contraction in April (49.0) but at a slower pace than in March (48.9). This could be an early sign of a turnaround in world trade but any significant improvement would probably depend on an easing of trade tensions.

Chart 3.10 

Global economic policy uncertainty, January 2005 – April 2019 

(Index, average 1997-2015 =100) Source: PolicyUncertainty.com An index of economic policy uncertainty, based on the frequency of phrases related to uncertainty in press accounts, currently stands at 203.8 (as of April 2019), down from the peak value of 341.3 recorded in January 2019 (see Chart 3.10). A baseline value of 100 denotes the “average” level of  uncertainty from 1997 to 2015. The peak of 341.3 coincided with the US government shutdown and US trade negotiations with China. As economic uncertainty deters investment, it can have a negative impact on trade since investment spending tends to rely on imports. Conversely, a lowering of trade tensions would be expected to stimulate both investment and trade. The data in Chart 3.10 do not re fl ect major trade measures announced in May 2019, which would tend to increase uncertainty. 

## Sustained GDP growth could boost trade in 2019 

Economic growth slowed more than expected in the middle of 2018, prompting governments and central banks to adopt more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. This appears to have provided a boost to GDP in the first quarter of 2019 for major economies but whether this will continue remains to be seen. Trade forecasts for 2019 depend on sustained GDP growth up to the end of the year. China continues to expand faster than most other manufacturing economies while the United States registered a healthy increase in output in the first quarter of 2019 (see Chart 3.11). A further escalation in trade tensions could derail trade and GDP growth.

## Exports of fuels and mining products declined over the past ten years 

World merchandise exports increased on average by 1.8 per cent per year from 2008 to 2018 but exports of fuels and mining products decreased by 0.9 per cent per year. In 2018, world exports of fuels and mining products stood at 91 per cent of their value in 2008 (see Chart 4.1). This is due to a combination of weaker demand and increased supply leading to a decline in fuel prices, which, in 2018, were 33 per cent below the level of 2008. Agricultural products saw the biggest increase, growing by 3.1 per cent per year and rising by 36 per cent compared to 2008. Exports of manufactured goods have risen by 26 per cent in comparison to 2008. Manufactured goods increased from 66 per cent of world trade in 2008 to a 68 per cent share in 2018 but fuels and mining products declined from a 22 per cent share to 19 per cent. The share of agricultural products grew from 8 per  cent to 10 per cent. Since 2016, world exports of all major product groups have shown growth: fuels and mining products have increased by 23 per cent since 2017, manufactured goods by 8 per cent and agricultural products by 5 per cent. Total merchandise exports have seen growth of 10 per cent since 2017. 

## Top ten exporters of agricultural products represented 72 per cent of world exports in 2018 

In 2018, the top seven exporters of agricultural products remained unchanged, led by the European Union, the United States and Brazil (see Chart 4.2). India moved up to eighth place and Australia down to ninth. Mexico moved up to tenth position while Argentina dropped out of the top ten. The biggest increases in exports of agricultural products within the top ten exporters were recorded by China (9 per cent), Brazil (6 per cent) and Mexico (6 per cent) while declines were experienced by Australia (-10 per cent) and Indonesia (-7 per cent). Australia’s largest declines were for wheat and meslin (-34 per cent) and barley (-13 per cent). Indonesia experienced declines in exports of animal or vegetable fats (-11 per cent) and rubber and related articles (-18 per cent).

Switzerland entered the top ten, overtaking Canada, which dropped to 12th position. Exports of manufactured goods increased for all of the top ten exporters, with the highest growth rates recorded by the European Union (+9.3 per cent) and China (+9.1 per cent). The United States (+4.6 per cent) and the Republic of Korea (+3.4 per cent) had the lowest growth rates among the top ten. The top ten exporters accounted for 83 per cent of world exports of manufactured goods in 2018. 

## India and the United States see decline in exports of iron and steel 

India and the United States experienced declines of 14 per cent and 5 per cent respectively in their exports of iron and steel in 2018 but the other top ten exporters saw increases. The highest growth rates were recorded by Turkey (39 per cent) and the Russian Federation (20 per cent – see Chart 4.7). The top six exporters remained in the same order – with the European Union in first place (38 per cent share in world exports), followed by China (14 per cent share) and Japan (7 per cent share). Turkey rose three places to seventh position while India fell from seventh to ninth. Chinese Taipei dropped from ninth to tenth. The top ten exporters accounted collectively for 83 per cent of world exports in 2018 (down from 85 per cent in 2017).

## Top ten exporters of chemicals account for 87 per cent of world exports 

The top ten exporters of chemicals, led by the European Union and the United States, remained in the same order in 2018 – except for the Republic of Korea overtaking Japan and moving into fifth position. All of the top ten exporters recorded growth (see Chart 4.8), ranging from 7 per cent (United States and Switzerland) to 20 per cent (India). India saw large increases to China (+72 per cent), Indonesia (+55 per cent) and Brazil (+37 per cent). The European Union accounted for 49 per cent of world exports in 2018, followed by the United States (10 per cent share) and China (7 per cent share). Collectively, the top ten were responsible for 87 per cent of world exports in 2018. 

## China accounts for almost one-third of world exports of office and telecom equipment 

The highest growth rates among the top ten exporters of office and telecom equipment in 2018 were recorded by Malaysia (16 per cent), Viet Nam (15 per cent) and China (13 per cent) – see Chart 4.9. The leading exporter, China, accounted for 32 per cent of world exports in 2018, followed by the European Union with a share of 19 per cent. The Republic of Korea moved up to fourth position, overtaking the United States, and Chinese Taipei moved into sixth place, overtaking Singapore. Malaysia moved up one place into eighth position while Viet Nam moved up to ninth position, recording a 15 per cent increase (4 per cent share). Mexico fell from eighth to tenth position.

## Canada’s exports of automotive products decrease by 4 per cent 

Eight of the ten top exporters of automotive products increased their export values in 2018 – with annual growth rates ranging from +0.2 per cent (United States) to +13 per  cent (Mexico). Two of the top ten saw decreases: Canada, -4 per cent, and the Republic of Korea, -1 per cent – see Chart 4.10). For Canada, this was mostly due to declines in exports of ‘motor cars, including station wagons” to the United States. For the Republic of Korea, there were also declines of motor cars to the United States as well as a decline in exports of trucks and buses to mostly Asian destinations. The European Union once again accounted for slightly more than 50 per cent of world exports of automotive products in 2018 (a 6 per cent increase) followed by Japan with a share of 10 per cent (+6 per cent) and the United States with a share of 9 per cent (see Chart 4.10). The order of the top nine exporters remained unchanged. However, India entered the top ten, overtaking Brazil. The top ten exporters accounted for 94 per cent of world exports in 2018.

## Transport services continued to grow in 2018 

World trade in transport services totalled over US$ 1 trillion in 2018, up 7 per cent, with growth in all regions (see Chart 4.11). The Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) recorded the highest growth (11 per cent), followed by Europe (9 per cent). Europe accounted for nearly half of global transport exports in 2018. Growth was below average in the Middle East as air and sea transport growth both levelled off. South and Central America and the Caribbean also saw slower transport growth than the world average in 2018, re fl ecting a slowdown in GDP growth in key regional economies and a particularly active Atlantic hurricane season. Air transport exports continued to grow in 2018, with the volume of airline cargo growing by 4.1 per cent. Air cargo yields grew at a faster rate than in 2017 but the second half of 2018 showed a slowdown in air freight shipments. 1 The CIS registered the highest growth in air freight transport (24 per cent) followed by Africa (21 per cent), both well above the world average growth rate of 11 per cent. International air passenger traffic saw significant growth in 2018, increasing by an estimated 7 per cent. Airline capacity grew at a slower rate, thereby raising the aircraft load factor (the percentage of seats filled per  fl ight) to a record high and contributing to airlines’ profitability. 2 The CIS had the highest growth in air passenger transport services (19 per cent) as regional airlines increased capacities. World air transport services rose by 8.5 per cent overall (see Chart 4.12).

Worldwide maritime freight exports increased by 5 per cent in 2018, down from the 12 per cent recorded in 2017, the lower figure being partly due to global trade uncertainties. Growth was particularly subdued in Asia (+1 per cent) while exports fell in the Middle East (-1 per cent) due to overcapacity and slowing transhipments. Freight transport via other modes, including rail and road, grew by 8 per cent, led by growth in Europe and Asia as rail freight between the two continents continued to expand. As in 2017, nearly every leading economy registered growth in its transport sector in 2018 (see Chart 4.13). China’s transport exports grew at the fastest rate (+14 per cent) followed by India, the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation. Japan was the only leading economy to post negative transport exports growth in 2018 due to an active typhoon season, notably typhoon Jebi, which disrupted operations at Kansai airport and Kobe sea port.

## Travel services continued to grow in 2018 

World travel exports, covering travellers’ expenditure on goods and services during their stay abroad, continued its upward trend of the past two years, growing 7 per cent in 2018 (see Chart 4.14). As in previous years, this was largely due to an increase in international tourism, with 2018 seeing 1.4 billion international arrivals – two years ahead of schedule. 3 An increase in tourist arrivals and higher traveller expenditure benefited all regions of the world, especially the CIS and Africa, which recorded growth in travel exports of 16 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively. CIS travel receipts were boosted by Russia’s hosting of the 2018 FIFA World Cup, leading to an increase in visitors to the region. Georgia had a significant increase in tourist arrivals, especially from the European Union, as new budget air routes between Tbilisi and the EU were implemented. Africa posted a second year of significant growth in travel exports (+12.5 per cent) and tourist arrivals (+12.1 per cent), led by growth in North Africa. Egypt, responsible on average for one-fifth of Africa’s travel exports over the past ten years, posted significant growth (+49 per cent) after another year of relatively stable security. Tunisia also saw increases in travel exports as tourists from Europe increasingly returned following the lifting of travel warnings to the country. Only a handful of African nations had a decline in travel receipts in 2018, mostly due to instability and security concerns. South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa’s most visited destination, had limited growth in 2018 because of a strong currency and severe drought in Cape Town. All leading travel services exporters showed an increase in both travel receipts and international tourist arrivals in 2018 (see Chart 4.15). Europe, the largest global exporter of travel services, had a third year of growth. Turkey had an especially high increase in tourist arrivals, bolstered by a favourable exchange rate, and Greece saw tourist numbers climb as off-season  fl ights increased. In Asia, Chinese tourists boosted travel receipts, particularly in the south-east. China registered low growth in travel exports following two years of decline. Travel and tourism in the Greater Bay Area of China in Hong Kong, China, and in Macao, China, received a boost from the opening of the Hong-Kong-Zuhai-Macau Bridge, a 55km bridge-tunnel system, in October 2018. The United States had low growth in travel receipts in 2018, although data for inbound tourists is only available for the first seven months of the year. South American travel receipts were bolstered by tourism within the region but Argentina’s currency crisis contributed to a decline in their neighbours’ exports. The Caribbean had mixed results as some destinations continued to rebuild after a heavy hurricane season in 2017 while others, notably the Dominican Republic and Jamaica, reported strong growth. The United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) anticipates tourism to slow in 2019 after a year of above-expected growth in 2018.

## Growth in other commercial services is led by ICT services 

Growth in trade of “other commercial services”, including financial services, business services and charges for the use of intellectual property, picked up pace in 2018, rising to over US $3.1 trillion. Nearly every region of the world saw growth in this category, continuing the trend from 2017 (see Chart 4.16). Growth in the CIS and the Middle East were both boosted by an upturn in insurance, telecommunications, computer and information services receipts. South and Central America saw a slight decline in other commercial services receipts as GDP slowed in key  economies, such as Brazil and Argentina.

Telecommunications, computer and information services (also referred to as information and communication technology – ICT) resumed its position as the most dynamic services sector in 2018 (+15 per cent). Insurance and pension services had the second highest growth rate (+8 per cent – see Chart 4.17). Growth in ICT and in insurance and pension services exports was recorded every year from 2008 to 2018 except in  2009 and 2010 respectively. ICT as a share of other commercial services increased from 2008 to 2018, rising from 16.1 per cent to 19.5 per cent. The sector has averaged 8 per cent growth over the past ten years, the highest of all sectors covered by other commercial services. The European Union was the leading exporter of ICT services in 2018, with Ireland the largest ICT exporter within the EU and in the world. India was the second-largest exporter with China overtaking the United States as the third-largest (see Chart 4.18).

Optical media includes trade of HS 8523.40, HS 8523.41, and HS 8523.49. 4 WTO estimates based on ITU data. While the share of telecommunications services has declined, computer services receipts have more than doubled in value, increasing their share of ICT trade from 65 per cent in 2008 to 78 per cent in 2018. Computer services, including database development, data processing and software design, has benefitted from technological changes such as an increase in businesses moving their IT  operations to cloud computing. Computer services trade has also seen increasing provision of software in a downloadable format, with regular updates, as opposed to trade in software on physical media, such as DVDs (see Chart 4.20). For example, Ireland – the largest global exporter of computer services – saw an increase in software exports as a service while physical exports declined from 2012 to 2016. Israel, on the other hand, saw both services and physical exports grow from 2010 to 2017. Its services grew more than 11 times faster than physical software exports. ICT services have always been dominated by computer services, whose share has increased over the past ten years as the share of telecommunications exports has declined (see Chart 4.19). Part of this decline is due to the diminishing cost of telecommunications transmission, which has fallen by 40 per cent since 2008. 4 This has contributed to the declining share of global telecommunications receipts in ICT services exports. Telecom receipts include payments for mobile telecommunications and internet provision, which did not grow significantly in value from 2008 to 2018.

(Annual percentage change) Source: OECD TiVA database. 5 See the WTO “Trade in Value added and Global Value Chains” country profiles. 

## Developing economies play growing roles in GVCs 

More than half of world trade in goods and services consists of intermediate products which are mostly exchanged within global value chains (GVCs), worldwide networks for the production of goods and services. Latest figures show that GVCs covered 57 per cent of world trade in 2015. Becoming part of these production chains is an opportunity for developing countries to boost their economic growth by taking advantage of their natural resources, productive capacities, workforce or specialized skills. The latest updates of the OECD Trade in Value Added (TiVA) database covering 64 economies including 26 developing economies, reveal that developing economies are as engaged in GVCs as developed economies. In 2015, both developed and developing economies had the same rate of GVC participation estimated to be 41.4 per  cent of their total exports. This re fl ects the global nature of production networks which rely on the participation of a  number of economies. Chart 4.21 shows that Asian economies have the highest growth rates in terms of contribution to GVCs, meaning that they are trading increasingly with international industrial partners. Viet Nam, the Philippines, China and India easily exceed the 6.5 per cent average, with Viet Nam recording the highest yearly growth of 16.5 per cent between 2005 and 2015. TiVA data outline that Vietnamese industries are playing an increasing role in textiles, clothing and agro-industry supply chains. For example, 25.7 per cent of the foreign value added content in Viet Nam’s exports stem from the textiles and clothing sector. 5 A number of Latin American economies, such as Colombia, Mexico, Brazil, Peru and Costa Rica, are also showing a growing participation in GVCs.

Backward and forward GVC participation, selected developing economies, 2015 

(Percentage in total gross exports) Source: OECD TiVA database. 6 Backward GVC participation is also referred to as “vertical specialization” when expressed as a percentage of gross exports. 7 See the following link from the OECD on the main reasons for data differences between the 2016 and 2018 versions of the TiVA database: http://www.oecd.org/industry/ind/tiva-2018-differences-tiva-2016.pdf Economies participate in GVCs in two ways. First, they import inputs to produce the goods and services they export (known as backward GVC participation) and second, they export domestically produced inputs to partners involved in the later stages of production (known as forward GVC participation). Saudi Arabia and Brunei Darussalam show high rates of forward GVC participation, re fl ecting their roles as core oil suppliers to GVCs, with respectively 37 per cent and 41 per cent of their exports contributing to GVCs (see Chart 4.22). Other exporters of primary products, such as Peru and Chile, participate at the start of supply chains and therefore have high rates of forward GVC participation. All of these economies require few inputs for their production processes. China’s role within GVCs has evolved considerably. The economy has advanced its domestic capacity to produce industrial goods, thus reducing its level of backward GVC participation. 6 At the same time, it has increased its exports of industrial goods to South-East Asia partners, boosting its forward GVC participation. In 2015, China’s rate of vertical specialization – or backward GVC participation – was 17.3 per cent lower than in 2005, standing at 26.3 per cent. However, this sharp decrease may be partly due to the way TiVA statistics have been revised, reducing the evaluation of vertical specialization. 7China’s forward GVC participation increased by 2 per cent over the same period, reaching 17.5 per cent in 2015. Mexico mainly acts as a “buyer” in GVCs and therefore has a significant rate of GVC backward participation, standing at 36 per cent in 2015. The economy imports inputs mostly from the United States and China to produce its exports. Its level of vertical specialization stood at 36 per cent in 2015, among the highest shown in Chart 4.22. Among South American economies, Argentina has a relatively low participation in GVCs, with less than 24 per cent of its exports in 2015 linked to GVC activities (in both backward and forward directions). Brazil’s rate is higher, standing at 33 per cent. The three African economies available in the TiVA database – Morocco, South Africa and Tunisia – have a more prominent backward rather than forward participation in GVCs. For South Africa, a key supplier of mining inputs to industries all over the world (with mining products representing 20 per cent of all South African value added in GVCs in 2015), the country has a high level of participation in both backward and forward GVC participation as the mining industry also imports significant amounts of inputs. In 2015, the import content of the exports of Tunisia and Morocco represented 29 per cent and 26 per cent respectively. The two economies import textile inputs for their clothing industries. In addition, Tunisia imports electrical equipment and Morocco imports chemical inputs for their production of exports. South-East Asian economies such as Singapore, Chinese Taipei and Malaysia show the highest rates of GVC participation, with more than 55 per cent of their trade taking place in international production networks, in both backward and forward directions. A total of 62 per cent of  Singapore’s trade was related to GVC activities in 2015, the  highest level among all economies in the TiVA database.

43 D ig ital t rade Questions remain on the scope and measurement of digital trade 

The question surrounding digital trade is whether it facilitates existing international trade or whether it creates additional trade, or both. Sometimes it is said that trade growth has been dampened by not measuring digital trade adequately. A McKinsey report published in 2016 included an infographic entitled “Global  fl ows of trade and finance are  fl attening, while data  fl ows are soaring”. 8 Thus, do conventional trade statistics re fl ect economic reality? Current trade statistics cannot quantify the level of international trade attributable to digital transactions, i.e. to digital ordering or digital delivery. Both these components together, however, can be used to determine the quantity of digital trade. In other words, digital trade can be explained via the nature of the transaction, i.e. whether it is digitally ordered or digitally delivered. Electronic tools or platforms facilitate trade by cutting out intermediaries. Statisticians struggle with how best to quantify this digital trade in a timely manner. A recent blog from the International Monetary Fund said: “Recent trends on global trade have tended to focus on protectionist measures and diplomatic tensions… Yet what is often lost in the current discussion is  that we are entering a new era of trade.” 9The market capitalisation of digital companies is soaring and at times exceeding the GDP of economies such as Spain, Mexico or Switzerland. In the United Kingdom, a study estimated that the annual growth rate over the past decade would have been between 0.4 and 0.7 percentage points higher if benefits arising from digitised products were fully accounted for. 10 The system of national accounts (SNA) is built around the use of finite resources. Although data is sometimes considered the “new oil”, it is essentially different to fuels in that data can be “copied and pasted” multiple times and their value depends on how a potential user can utilise these data and create value from it. However, the measurement of cross-border digital trade must be in line with national accounts to allow for  accurate analysis of statistical indicators. The statistical community has developed a conceptual framework based on how digital transactions are undertaken and by whom. E-commerce is defined as something that is ordered digitally but delivered either physically or digitally. Platforms facilitate this process of digital ordering and delivering. For trade policy purposes, transactions need to be broken down by product (broadly goods or services; however, sub-categories should re fl ect newly created goods and services to allow policy-makers to take account of economic developments). Digitally ordered transactions refer to OECD’s definition of  e-commerce 11 and define “digitally ordered” as: “An e-commerce transaction [as] the sale or purchase of a good or service, conducted over computer networks by methods specifically designed for the purpose of receiving or  placing orders.” 12 Digitally delivered transactions refer to UNCTAD’s definition of ICT and ICT-enabled services (TGServ). 13 “All cross-border transactions that are delivered remotely over ICT networks – i.e. over voice or data networks, including the internet, in an electronically downloadable format.” 8 McKinsey, March 2016 9 IMF Blog, 30/05/2018 10 “UK richer and growing faster than official figures suggest”, The Financial Times, 11 March 2016 11 It is important to note that the definition measures the total value of the product being traded, whether that product has digital characteristics or not. 12 OECD, Guide to Measuring the Information Society, 2011 13 With membership from ITU, OECD, UNCTAD, UNESCWA, UNSD, World Bank and WTO.

Actors is broken down into broad categories: business to consumer (B2C), business to business (B2B), government to consumer (G2C), consumer to consumer (C2C). Although some countries have started pilot projects, no reliable estimates of the digital economy at cross-country level currently exist. Any available estimates have been calculated via a variety of methodologies, with numerous assumptions, and often refer to the total sales rather than cross-border. At the end of March 2019, UNCTAD estimated global sales of e-commerce (defined as digitally ordered transactions, whether digitally or physically delivered) to be close to US$ 29 trillion for 2017. It reported that 88 per cent of these sales are taking place between businesses (B2B). However, these estimates refer to global sales and do not specify the cross-border proportion, apart from B2C estimates where the global share for cross-border transactions is estimated at 2.3 per cent. Turning to digitally delivered services and applying UNCTAD’s scope of services that could potentially be delivered digitally (that is, insurance and pension services, financial services, charges for the use of intellectual property, telecommunications, computer and information services, other business services, and personal, cultural and recreational services) 14 results in a traded value which increased from US$ 1,855 billion in 2008 to US$ 2,964 billion in 2018 (see Chart 4.23).

46 World Trade Statistical Review 2019 11 The ten leading merchandise and commercial services traders represented 53% of world trade in 2018. Asia’s share of global merchandise exports increased by 6percentage points over the past ten years, rising from 28 per cent in 2008 to 34 per cent in 2018. In services, developing economies’ share of world exports gained over 5percentage points over the past ten years and their share of world imports grew almost 7 percentage points. In 2018, Asian economies recorded the most rapid export growth in “other commercial services” since 2011, with China’s exports increasing by 17% due to strong growth in exports of computer services, construction, other business services and intellectual property-related services.

## More than half of merchandise trade is concentrated among ten economies 

The ten leading merchandise traders remained unchanged in 2018, with China, the United States and Germany leading the way (see Chart 5.1). Collectively, the top ten economies represented 53.3 per cent of world trade. The top five leading economies accounted for 38.1 per cent of total trade, economies from fifth to tenth place accounting for 15 per cent. For the second year in a row, China remained the leading merchandise trader despite growing global trade tensions. With a share of 13 per cent of total exports and 11 per cent of total imports, China’s exports stood at US$ 2.49 trillion and its imports at US$ 2.14 trillion in 2018, growing at the fastest pace since 2012. An increase in the import/export of electronic integrated circuits, computer parts and crude oil contributed to China’s overall export growth. China’s trade surplus contracted for a third consecutive year, ending the year 16 per cent lower than its 2017 level. Over the past ten years, China has shifted its exports to products with higher added value. Exports of mobile phones and parts rose from 6 per cent to 10 per cent of total exports. With exports growing at an average annual rate of 6.1 per cent, China has moved up from the second-largest exporter in 2008 (behind the United States) to the largest exporter in 2018. The United States maintained its position as the top importer of merchandise trade. US imports totalled US$ 2.61 trillion in 2018, increasing by 8.5 per cent. This re fl ected continued momentum in private consumption and fixed investment. Exports totalled US$ 1.66 trillion, up 8 per cent. The increase in shale oil production coupled with higher oil prices and increases in orders of civil aircraft and corn (+35 per cent) contributed to the rise. Germany maintained its position as the third-largest trader, with merchandise exports totalling US$ 1.56 trillion, 8 per cent higher than the previous year. This was marked by steady growth for auto-parts and pharmaceutical products. The Netherlands was the most dynamic exporter, increasing its exports by 11 per cent in 2018. This was mostly due to increases in the value of fuel exports and medication (+30%). Over the past ten years, exports of medicines have grown from 1 per cent to 3 per cent of total exports.

48 Japan remained the fourth-largest trader, with exports growing by 6 per cent in 2018, totalling US$ 94.5 billion. The slowdown in exports of non-electrical machinery and parts of electronic circuits contributed to a 2 per cent decline in year-on-year terms. As a net importer of petroleum, the increase in oil prices contributed to a rise in imports of 10 per cent in 2018. After two consecutive years of trade surplus, Japan recorded a trade deficit of US$ 10.3 billion. Overtaking Hong Kong (China), France became the sixth-largest trader. Exports of transport equipment, specifically automobiles and civil aviation parts, contributed to 8 per cent growth in 2018. Due to a decline in exports of precious metals and gold to China, the exports of Hong Kong (China) grew by 3 per cent, the lowest increase among the Asian economies. The United Kingdom was the second most dynamic trader among the top ten in 2018, recording growth of 10 per cent. Exports totalled US$ 519.3 billion, with “other machinery” being the most buoyant product group, according to preliminary estimates. The UK’s trade deficit narrowed in 2018, with imports growing by 5 per cent, mostly due to an increase in office and telecom equipment. The United Kingdom remained the tenth-largest exporter and the eighth-largest importer. Exports of the Republic of Korea grew by only 5 per cent in 2018, down from 15 per cent in 2017, due to a decline in exports of integrated circuits and parts. Despite this result, the Republic of Korea remained the ninth-largest trader, with exports totalling US$ 604.9 billion. Imports totalled US$ 535.2 billion, increasing by 8 per cent, down from 16 per  cent the previous year. This was mostly due to a decline in  the  value of imports of other machinery. Italy, in tenth position, saw export growth of 8 per cent, lower than in 2017, mostly due to a contraction in exports of motor cars and air and vacuum pumps. Growth in imports remained at 11 per cent. India overtook Italy as the tenth-largest importer. Chart 5.2

> Leading traders: The new “movers and shakers”

In the past ten years, developing economies have been the most dynamic, with significant increases in their rankings among the world’s leading exporters and importers (see Chart 5.2). As a whole, developing economies grew faster than the 1.8 per cent world average for 2008-2018. The Republic of Korea moved into the top ten traders while India and Poland moved up eight and seven positions respectively in the ranking of exporters. India’s exports have doubled since 2008. Increases in exports of transport equipment, chemicals and food products to North America and Asia contributed to its move up to 19th position in the world rankings. Poland has risen to 22nd position, with Germany remaining its main trading partner. Its supply of inputs into European value chains include “other machinery” (e.g. insulated cables) and automotive products. Viet Nam saw the largest change in the ranking of leading importers since 2008, moving up 18 positions. Recording growth of 12 per cent on average during this period, Viet Nam has firmly integrated into Asian value chains, supplying parts for the production of office and telecom equipment in the Republic of Korea and China. Its share of world imports of office and telecom equipment increased to 22 per cent, up from 6 per cent in 2008. The United Arab Emirates rose seven places in the world ranking, partly due to increases in its imports of gold and precious stones and office and telecom equipment. With the largest port in the Middle East, re-exports of the United Arab Emirates to Africa, the Commonwealth of Independent States and neighbouring countries have had an impact on its ranking. India rose six places in the world import ranking, moving up to tenth position. Strong domestic demand and high oil prices contributed mostly to this, with increases in imports of fuels and mining products, precious stones and electrical machinery being the main factors.

## Top ten traders of commercial services represented 53.2 per cent of world trade in 2018 

In global services trade, the ten leading traders remained unchanged in 2018, with the same countries retaining their ranking as the top exporters and importers. In the last ten years, however, the composition of leading services traders has changed profoundly (see Chart 5.3). Since 2008, China has jumped from the seventh-largest to the second-largest services trader. India and Singapore have moved into ninth and tenth positions, overtaking Italy and Spain. Among developed economies, Ireland has risen from tenth to seventh place, thanks to the rapid growth in exports of computer services. Overall, the top ten economies represented 53.2 per cent of world trade in 2018. The United States remained the world’s leading trader of commercial services in 2018, with a share of 14 per cent in world services exports and 9.8 per cent in imports, totalling US$ 808.2 billion in exports and US$ 536.2 billion in imports. Over the past ten years, US exports grew by 5 per cent annually, faster than imports (3 per cent). Its trade surplus doubled from US$ 13.4 billion in 2008 to US$ 27.2 billion in 2018. Travel and other business services increased their shares in both exports and imports while the contribution of transport declined. Services related to intellectual property (charges for the use of IP n.i.e.) remains a key sector for the United States, with a 16.1 per cent share of total US exports and 10.0 per cent of imports. The United Kingdom’s services exports increased by 6 per  cent in 2018 (see Chart 5.4). Services growth over the past ten years was boosted by “other business services”, the United Kingdom’s leading sector, accounting for 29 per cent

In contrast, financial services, the second-largest traded sector, has lost 6 per cent in its total share since 2008. In 2018, the UK was the second-largest services exporter and the fifth-largest importer. Germany remained the third-largest exporter and importer of commercial services globally in 2018. All services categories recorded robust growth, except for exports of personal, cultural, and recreational services. This includes audio-visuals and related activities, which contracted by 34 per cent. France maintained its position as the fifth-largest trader in both services exports and imports. As the number one global destination in terms of international tourist arrivals, France’s travel earnings continued to rise after the 2016 decline due to terrorist attacks. As in other EU member states, “other business services” became a key sector, representing almost one-third of France’s exports. China’s exports recorded the strongest export growth (17 per  cent) among the top ten economies in 2018 and remained the world’s fifth-largest services exporter. Information and communication technology services, largely computer services, expanded by 69 per cent in 2018, exceeding the export value of transport and travel. China confirmed its ranking as the second-largest importer of commercial services, with an increased share of world imports (9.5 per cent). This was mostly thanks to its high travel expenditure abroad, which accounts for more than half of its services payments. In 2018, the Netherlands recorded the third-strongest growth among leading traders in exports and imports of services. In both cases, it was due to other business services and charges for the use of intellectual property n.i.e., which accounts for about one-third and one-quarter respectively of the Netherlands’ trade in commercial services. Other business services became one of the fastest growing import sectors between 2008 and 2018 and is the most important category in both exports and imports. The Netherlands remained the sixth-largest services exporter and slipped one position behind the United Kingdom on the import side. Ireland recorded the second-best exports performance among leading traders in 2018 (a 14 per cent increase) mostly due to rising exports of computer services. The country maintained its seventh position as services trader. Computer services form half of Ireland’s services exports. Imports of IP-related services and other business services both accounted for some 40 per cent of Ireland’s services payments. In 2018, India was the eighth-largest services exporter and the tenth-largest services importer. Rapid export growth in other business services for three consecutive years (around 9 per cent) and in telecommunications, computer and information services (7 per cent in 2018) boosted the country’s performance.

## Asia has recorded the highest regional trade growth since 2008 

In 2018, merchandise trade growth remained strong across all regions. World trade grew at 11 per cent on average in 2018, 1 per cent less than in 2017. The sustained rise in prices of fuels and mining products (+26 per cent) contributed to this growth. Except for South and Central America, all net commodity exporting regions grew above the world average. Over the past ten years, all regions – except the Commonwealth of Independent States and Africa – have attained their pre-crisis trade levels of 2008 (see Chart 5.5). Asia recorded the highest regional trade growth from 2008 to  2018. In 2018, its trade  fl ows were 1.5 times higher than its  2008 levels. China, Viet Nam and India were the most dynamic traders among all Asian economies. The development of regional value chains in office and telecom equipment highly contributed to the pace of growth of economies such as Viet Nam. Vietnamese exports of office and telecom equipment have grown considerably, accounting for 23 per cent of Vietnamese exports in 2018, up from 1 per cent in 2008.

Exports of total merchandise trade by region, 2008 and 2018 

(Percentage share) Source: WTO calculations based on WTO-UNCTAD estimates. Over the past ten years, Asia’s share of world exports increased by 6 percentage points, rising from 28 per cent in 2008 to 34 per cent in 2018 (see Chart 5.6). In contrast, Africa’s share in world exports declined from 3.5 per cent to 2.5 per cent – the lowest regional share. Nonetheless, Africa maintained its double-digit growth in 2018. Exports grew by 14 per cent – 4 per cent lower than in 2017. South African exports grew moderately, mainly due to a price decline for copper following its 33 per cent growth in 2017. Africa’s oil exporters continued to perform well in 2018, accounting for 38 per cent of total exports. North African exports continued to grow thanks to an increase in demand from Europe. Morocco saw its exports grow by 10 per cent, mostly due to an increase in exports of electrical conductors to the European Union. The countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) saw their share of exports decline, from 4.4 per cent of the world total in 2008 to 3.4 per cent in 2018. Conversely, for the second year in a row, the CIS was the best performing region in 2018, with total trade growth of 17 per cent. Exports soared by 24 per cent, totalling US$ 640.2 billion. The overall increase was mostly driven by the Russian Federation, which accounts for more than half (58 per cent) of CIS exports, and by the rise in oil prices. Imports for the CIS declined by 8.4 per cent (+20 per cent in 2017), with Russian imports only growing by 5 per cent due to lower imports of office and telecom equipment. Exports of the Middle East grew by 21 per cent in 2018, totalling US$ 1.13 trillion, with fuels and mining products accounting for 55 per cent of total exports. South and Central American exports grew by 8 per cent in 2018, totalling US$ 635.2 billion. The top four economies 1 of the region (Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru) exhibited lower export growth than in 2017. Brazil, which accounts for 38 per  cent of total exports, saw its export growth decline to 10 per cent (down from 18 per cent in 2017) due to lower exports of automotive products and sugar. Imports of South and Central America totalled US$ 645.4 billion in 2018, up 10 per cent, re fl ecting an increase in domestic demand in the four leading economies. Argentina, in contrast, saw a decline of 2 per cent in its imports due to a contraction in domestic demand in 2018. 2 Caribbean economies bounced backed after a series of devastating hurricanes that had a damaging impact on the islands in 2017. Europe and North America enjoyed similar growth patterns in merchandise trade. In Europe, trade grew by 9.3 per cent in 2018, with exports reaching US$ 7.11 trillion and imports totalling US$ 7.15 trillion. Trade growth in North America continued after a setback in 2015-2016 but it recorded the weakest growth of all regions (+8 per cent). In 2018, exports totalled US$ 2.56 trillion and imports reached US$ 3.56 trillion.

## Services growth lags in the Americas 

In 2018, world trade in services continued its steady upward trend, growing on average by 8 per cent. The CIS countries recorded the highest growth in exports (12 per cent), with widespread growth across regions in all services sectors (see Chart 5.7). Services imports expanded fastest in Africa. Services demand surged in Nigeria, which in 2017 became the region’s largest services importer but also in Ethiopia, Mozambique and Kenya. Africa’s services trade performance was also remarkable for exports, thanks in particular to fast growth in Ethiopia and Egypt, notably in transport and travel. In 2018, Asian economies recorded the most rapid export growth since 2011, led by “other commercial services”. China’s exports increased by 17 per cent, with particularly strong growth in exports of computer services, construction, other business services and intellectual property-related services. India’s exports grew by 11 per cent and those of the Republic of Korea by 10 per cent. IT services exports were the main drivers of Europe’s export growth but other business services, transport, tourism, financial and insurance services, and IP-related services were also strong. The only sector with sluggish growth was construction following a decline in 2017. Other regions were less dynamic. The Middle East’s trade performance was below average as growth slowed in the United Arab Emirates, the main services trader, and in other economies such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Declines were recorded in transport and in travel. Thanks to swift growth in other business services, Israel was the only country in the region with growth above the world average. Services growth lagged in the Americas. In South and Central America and the Caribbean, services trade expanded by only 1 per cent. Growth was sluggish across the region, with the Caribbean seeing declining tourist arrivals while trade declined in Brazil and Argentina. For the second consecutive year, growth was slow in North America as US services exports and imports rose respectively by 4 per cent and 3 per cent.

## African RTAs have increased their regional participation over the past ten years 

Out of the ten RTAs shown in Chart 5.8, the European Union is by far the largest in terms of trade, accounting for 34 per cent of world merchandise trade in 2018. Notably, the EU has maintained the largest share of trade within an RTA, with 64 per cent of its total exports according to the latest trade data available. Little has changed in the ranking of RTAs since 2008. However, the destination of exports of these RTAs has changed somewhat (see Chart 5.8). The European Union, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have remained unchanged or barely changed in terms of export destination over the past ten years. Despite being the most intensive RTA regarding internal trade, the European Union has seen its exports to destinations within the EU decline by 4 percentage points in the past ten years. However, EU exports of manufacturing products to North America and Asia have increased. ASEAN has seen little change in its export destinations, emphasizing the importance of the regional dimension of this economic bloc. NAFTA remains unchanged, maintaining 50 per cent of its exports among its members. In October 2018, NAFTA members renegotiated their agreement under a new United States-Mexico-Canada Comprehensive Agreement (USMCA). Some of its revised provisions could bring changes to the export destinations of its members. First, the requirement of local content for automobiles to be imported duty-free has increased from 62.5 per cent to 75 per cent. Second, 40 per cent of the local content of automobiles must be manufactured by workers earning on average US$ 16 per hour after 2023. Thirdly, Canada would increase the tariff quotas on the dairy market, allowing the United States to access 3.6 per cent of it. 3A few African RTAs have seen an increase in exports within the RTA. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) saw their intra-regional shares increase by around 10 percentage points in the past ten years. For both RTAs – particularly for COMESA – Africa became the second-largest destination for exports in 2018, with increases in food and manufacturing products. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) increased by 2 percentage points both its share of intra-RTA and intra-regional trade. Despite the slight increase, intra-regional exchanges are third in order of importance for the regional bloc. On the other hand, the members of the Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) trade more with the rest of the world: only 5 per  cent of exports stay in the African continent. 3 “USMCA Factsheets”. https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement/fact-sheets

Among the African RTAs, the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) holds the highest share of intra-regional trade, with 26 per cent of total exports in 2018. However, it has seen a decline in its intra-regional exports, together with the Southern Common Market (MERCOSUR) and the Andean Community (CAN). Intra-regional exports have fallen by 5 percentage points on average since 2008. Asia, and in particular China, has increased its relevance as a destination of exports from these countries, and in some cases, it has become the leading export partner. Apart from COMESA, RTAs that have seen an increase in intra-regional exports, export mostly to Asia (see Chart 5.9). In South and Central American RTAs, there have been some changes in membership among the regional blocs. First, Venezuela withdrew from the Andean Community in 2006 and its preferential treatment under the agreement continued until 2011. 4 Nevertheless, partial scope agreements were signed by Venezuela and the members of the Andean Community under the umbrella of the Latin American Integration Association (LAIA) to grant continuity of preferential access of Venezuelan/Andean products into their markets. Second, Venezuela became a full member of MERCOSUR in 2012 but due to political turmoil, it was suspended from the trading bloc in early 2017. 5 Because of the persistent economic crisis in Venezuela, both CAN and MERCOSUR members have shifted their exports to other regions. For instance, in 2008, Venezuela was Colombia’s second-largest export destination, with 16 per cent of total exports. Today, exports of Colombia to Venezuela represent merely 0.8 per cent of the total. 

Asia became a leading destination of exports of Latin American and African regional groups in 2018.

# D evelopi ng econom ie s Developing economies’ merchandise trade continued to rise in 2018 

Merchandise exports of developing economies grew by 11  per cent in 2018 while imports increased by 12 per cent, continuing the positive growth of 2017 after a decline in 2015-16. Merchandise exports totalled US$ 8.22 trillion and imports US$ 7.97 trillion in 2018. Exports and imports grew across all regions in 2018, apart from imports of developing countries in Europe, which showed a slight decrease of 1  per cent (see Table 5.1). Overall, developing economies’ exports and imports grew at a faster rate than those of developed economies and the world. Developing economies in Africa and the Middle East showed the strongest export growth in 2018. On the import side, Latin America, Africa and Developing Asia had double-digit growth in 2018.

## Fuel prices impact Africa and Middle East exports 

The export growth of Africa and the Middle East over the past ten years has been clearly linked to fuel price developments (see Chart 5.10). A notable decline in exports occurred between 2014 and 2016 when there was an excess global stock of fuel products and a related decline in fuel prices. Several factors contributed to the global oil surplus, including the growth of US shale production and the decision of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain oil output as a means of retaining market share. On the demand side, China’s previously strong demand for fuel and other mineral products slowed considerably. Given the supply-side and demand-side factors, the pressure on fuel prices to rise was weak during this period. However, both African and Middle Eastern fuel exporters have since had a return to growth in 2017 and 2018 following the rise in energy prices. Developing economies’ exports had a similar pattern of growth and decline due to the  fl uctuations in fuel prices but with a less severe decline between 2014 and 2016 as other sectors partly made up for the decline in fuel exports. 

Export growth of Africa and the Middle East, large oil and gas exporters, is highly linked to fuel prices. World Trade Statistical Review 2019

## Several developing economies see dynamic increase in merchandise trade 

Several developing economies have seen a dynamic increase in merchandise trade exports over the past ten years. These include Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Ghana, Guinea, Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Mongolia and Rwanda (see Chart 5.11), five of which are least-developed countries. Cambodia is primarily an exporter of manufactured goods; apparel and clothing continues to be its top export. The other six economies are primarily commodity exporters. Burkina Faso and Ghana are large exporters of gold and Guinea’s primary exports are aluminium ores and concentrates (bauxite). Guinea has the world’s largest reserves of bauxite, the primary ore of aluminium. Its growth in bauxite exports has been driven by demand from China, the world’s largest producer and consumer of aluminium. Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Mongolia are largely exporters of mineral products. Rwanda has quadrupled its exports to its key trading partner, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. 

Ghana and Cambodia have seen steep increases in their exports over the past ten years.

## Developing economies represented over 30 per cent of global services exports in 2018 

In 2018, developing economies’ exports of global services exports reached 30.9 per cent of the world total, the highest level they have ever recorded. Their imports totalled 38.2 per cent. Over the past ten years, developing economies have gained over 5 percentage points in the share of world services exports and almost 7 percentage points in world imports (see Chart 5.12). Participation in commercial services is uneven across developing regions and services sectors (see Chart 5.13). Developing economies in Asia are the main traders and drivers of growth, with their contribution reaching 20.8 per  cent of global services exports and 25.1 per cent of imports in 2018. The Middle East has increased its share in world exports to 3.8 per cent while the participation of other regions, such as Africa, has remained static or declined. In 2018, more than half of world construction exports originated from developing economies, with China accounting for almost one-quarter of world exports and the Republic of Korea for 10.4 per cent (see Chart 5.14). For both countries, construction exports are mostly destined to other developing economies. International tourist arrivals to developing economies soared over the past ten years. In 2018, developing economies represented almost 40 per cent of global travel receipts, with the share of travel in services exports at its highest in Latin America and the Caribbean (48.9 per cent) and Africa (44.7 per cent). The largest travel exporter is Thailand, which doubled its share in global travel exports to 4.4 per cent between 2008 and 2018.

Transport is a key export sector for many developing economies (representing a 34.8 per cent share of total exports of commercial services in 2018), with developing economies in Asia at the forefront (see Table 5.2). With a 5.1 per cent share, Singapore was the top transport exporter in 2018 followed by China (4.2 per cent). Developing economies play an important role in information and communication technology (ICT) services, representing 30.9 per cent of world exports of telecommunications in 2018 and 25.6 per cent of computer services. India is the leading exporter of IT services among these economies and the second-largest global exporter, with a share in world exports of 11.7 per cent. In telecommunications, Kuwait is the world’s third-largest exporter, with a 3.1 per cent share of global exports. Other services, such as insurance and pension services, financial services, and intellectual property-related services (charges for the use of intellectual property n.i.e.), continues to be dominated by developed economies. The most rapid export growth for developing economies (17 per cent) was recorded by IP-related services in 2018. However, developing economies’ participation is at its lowest in this sector (8.3 per cent share of total commercial services).

## Share of least-developed countries in world exports exceeds 1 per cent 

Merchandise exports of least-developed countries (LDCs) rose from US$ 153 billion in 2008 to US$ 193 billion in 2018 (see Chart 5.15). On average, exports increased 2.4 per cent per year, a faster rate than world exports (1.8  per  cent per year). In 2018, exports grew by 13  per  cent compared with world growth of 10 per cent. LDC exports were in fl uenced by an increase in world energy prices as their exports tend to be concentrated in fuels and mining products. Merchandise imports of LDCs increased at a lower rate (+10 per cent). For the first time since 2014, LDCs’ share of world merchandise exports exceeded 1 per cent in 2018, reaching 1.02 per cent (see Chart 5.16). Imports remained at the same level as in both 2016 and 2017, namely at 1.41 per cent. Among developing economies, LDCs’ share of exports slightly increased (from 2.30 per cent in 2017 to 2.34 per  cent in 2018) while it decreased for imports (from 3.46 per  cent in 2017 to 3.43 per cent in 2018).

All LDC exporter categories (see Chart 5.17) recorded positive growth rates, with LDC oil exporters showing the largest increase in 2018 (20 per cent). The lowest growth rate was recorded by LDC exporters of non-fuel minerals (6 per cent). The exports of “other LDCs” (Djibouti, Senegal and Tuvalu) increased by 18 per cent. LDC exporters of manufactured goods saw a 12 per cent increase and LDC exporters of agriculture grew by 8 per cent. Among the top 15 LDC exporters (in terms of export value), the highest growth in exports in 2018 was recorded by Angola (22 per cent) and Myanmar (21 per cent), which are both oil exporters, and Cambodia (19 per cent), an exporter of manufactured goods. Declines were recorded by Sudan (-15 per cent), an oil exporter, and by Tanzania (-12 per cent) and Guinea (-11 per cent), exporters of non-fuel minerals. LDCs’ merchandise trade deficit increased slightly in 2018 (to US$ 80 billion) but remained less than the previous record deficit of 2015 (US$ 89 billion – see Chart 5.18). The deficit in 2018 was mainly due to a significant increase in the deficit of LDC exporters of manufactured goods (US$ 45 billion in 2018 versus US$ 35 billion in 2017). With the exception of Lesotho, all countries in this category saw their imports increase more than their exports. The largest increase in the trade deficit was recorded by Cambodia (39 per cent), followed by Bangladesh (31 per cent), Nepal (31 per cent), Haiti (30 per cent), and Madagascar (19 per cent). The trade deficits of LDC exporters of non-fuel minerals increased from US$ 6 billion in 2017 to US$ 9 billion in 2018 and other LDCs saw an increase from US$ 4 billion to US$ 5 billion. The trade deficit of LDC exporters of agriculture remained static at US$ 33 billion. Only LDC oil exporters recorded a trade surplus (US$ 12 billion) in 2018.

## LDCs’ services exports up by 16 per cent in 2018 

In 2018, LDCs’ exports of commercial services expanded by 16 per cent, twice faster than the rest of the world. LDCs’ exports reached US$ 39.8 billion, the highest level ever recorded by these countries. As a result, in 2018, LDCs’ contribution to world services exports rose to 0.69 per cent. Transport exports rose by 22 per cent, re fl ecting swift growth not only in Ethiopia, the LDCs’ largest transport exporter, but also in several other countries. For the first time, LDCs’ contribution to global transport exports reached 1 per cent, up from 0.4 per cent in 2008. Air transport, mainly passengers, accounts for more than half of LDCs’ transport exports. Travel expanded very rapidly in 2018, growing by 11 per cent and reaching US$ 19.8 billion. Tourism is the leading services export sector for LDCs (49.8 per cent of total commercial services), with a 1.4 per cent share of world exports, the highest rate recorded by LDCs among all service sectors. Tourism in LDCs is predominantly intra-regional. In 2018, dynamic growth was recorded by Cambodia (+20 per cent), the LDCs’ main exporter, and by  Zambia, Nepal, Mozambique and others. Despite a 12 per cent rise in 2018, LDCs’ contribution to global exports of other commercial services remained static at 0.27 per cent, the same level as in 2008, confirming LDCs’ struggle in penetrating higher-value services markets. In 2018, LDCs’ services imports reached US$ 73.6 billion, up by 9 per cent, showing signs of recovery following the declines of 2015 and 2016, with transport alone accounting for half of LDCs’ services imports (see Chart 5.19). With a share of 14.2 per cent in LDCs’ imports, Bangladesh became the leading services importer among LDCs, overtaking Angola, the previous leading importer over ten years. LDCs are net importers of services. LDCs’ services trade deficit has declined only marginally since 2008, from US$ 34.4 billion to US$ 33.8 billion in 2018. Both transport and other commercial services have experienced persistent trade deficits but travel has recorded an expanding surplus since 2005, attaining US$ 10.6 billion in 2018.

## LDCs in Asia play increasing role as services exporters 

The last decade has seen the rise of LDCs in Asia as services exporters (see Chart 5.20). From 2008 to 2018, Asian LDCs recorded the most rapid export growth among LDC regions, at 11 per cent on average annually, thanks to the very strong performances of Cambodia and Myanmar as leading tourism destinations, and Bangladesh and Nepal as ICT exporters. In 2018, these eight Asian economies accounted for 42.3 per cent of LDCs’ exports, up from 33.4 per cent in 2008. Despite the rapid growth of transport, fuelled by Ethiopia as an exporter of air transport, and of tourism, especially in Tanzania and Uganda, services growth in African LDCs was relatively slower (7 per cent on average per year). As a result, LDCs in Africa saw their share in LDCs’ services trade drop by 7 percentage points to 52.0 per cent in 2018.

67 T rade mon itor i ng A decade of WTO trade monitoring reports 

The WTO trade monitoring exercise was initiated at the end of 2008 in the wake of the financial crisis. First and foremost a transparency exercise, it is intended to provide WTO members with regular updates on the latest trends in trade measures and important developments in trade-policy making. The reports provide increased transparency and predictability of the international trading environment to the benefit of policy-makers, traders and consumers. Accountability is assured through twice-yearly review of the reports by WTO members in meetings of the WTO’s Trade Policy Review Body. The reports are purely factual and have no legal effect on the rights and obligations of WTO members. A decade after the first trade monitoring report by the WTO was circulated, the international trading environment is characterized by increasing trade tensions. The WTO’s latest Trade Monitoring Report, circulated on 8 July 2019, 1provides evidence of continuing trade tensions, which are contributing to uncertainty in the international trade environment and the world economy. The report shows that the turbulence described in the previous report 2 has not subsided, with trade  fl ows being hit by new trade restrictions at a historically high level. 

## Steep increase in trade coverage of import-restrictive measures 

WTO members implemented 38 new trade-restrictive measures during the latest review period. While fewer measures were introduced than in previous periods, the scale of those measures is much increased in terms of their trade coverage and the level of tariffs imposed. Trade measures implemented by G20 economies accounted for the vast bulk of the trade covered by import-restrictive measures. Out of the 38 new trade-restrictive measures recorded, more than 80 per cent were applied to imports. Tariff increases accounted for more than half of all import-restrictive measures, followed by a range of import bans, special safeguards and import taxes. With respect to exports, most of the measures taken were duties followed by bans and stricter customs procedures. The trade coverage of the import-restrictive measures implemented during the latest review period was estimated at US$ 339.5 billion. As shown in Chart 6.1, this is the second-highest figure on record, after the US$ 588.3 billion reported in the previous period. Together, these two periods represent a dramatic spike in the trade coverage of import-restrictive measures. The downward trend identified between mid-October 2014 and mid-October 2017 has been replaced with a steep increase in the trade coverage of import-restrictive measures. The trade coverage of new import-restrictive measures introduced by WTO members during this period was 44 per cent above the average since October 2012 when  the reports started including trade coverage figures. The main sectors targeted by import-restrictive measures were machinery and mechanical appliances (19.1 per cent), electrical machinery and parts thereof (15.6 per cent), precious metals (10.7 per cent) and prefabricated buildings and certain furniture (8.1 per cent). The report also notes that several significant trade-restrictive measures either will be implemented shortly or remain under review for potential later implementation, suggesting that the precarious situation in global trade will persist. Announced measures that have yet to be implemented will be covered by  the annual overview to be circulated by the end of 2019. 1 Document WT/TPR/OV/W/13, 8 July 2019. 2 Document WT/TPR/OV/21, 27 November 2018. World Trade Statistical Review 2019 

68 WTO members implemented 47 new measures aimed at facilitating trade during the latest review period. The reduction or elimination of import tariffs continued to make up most of the trade-facilitating measures followed by the reduction of import taxes and the simplification of customs procedures. On the export side, the elimination or simplification of customs procedures and the reduction of export duties are the most frequent measures recorded. The trade coverage of the import-facilitating measures implemented during this period was estimated at US$ 398.2 billion. This is almost 3 per cent above the average since October 2012. The sectors covered by most of the import-facilitating measures were machinery and mechanical appliances (15.6 per cent), electrical machinery and parts thereof (13.9 per cent), copper and articles thereof (8.9 per cent) and plastic and articles thereof (7.5 per cent). For the first time since 2012, the number of terminations of trade remedy investigations by WTO members outpaced the number of initiations of trade remedy actions. The report recorded 16 trade remedy terminations per month and 14 trade remedy initiations, with the latter being the lowest monthly average registered since 2012. Initiations of anti-dumping investigations continue to be the most frequent trade remedy action, accounting for three-quarters of all initiations. The trade coverage of trade remedy initiations recorded in the report was estimated at US$ 20.2 billion while the total for trade remedy terminations was US$ 16.4 billion. Trade remedy actions covered a wide range of products, including initiations of investigations into prefabricated buildings and certain furniture (29.2 per cent), products of iron and steel (21.4 per cent), iron and steel (11.3 per cent), machinery and mechanical appliances (9.7 per cent) and cereals (6.4 per cent). Information on trade measures included in the trade monitoring reports is either submitted by WTO members and observers or collected from other official and public sources. The information assembled is verified by the members concerned. In the latest report, information was submitted by 69 members (counting the European Union and its member states separately), which represents 42 per cent of the WTO’s membership and 90.5 per cent of world imports. One observer also replied to the request for information. Chart 6.1

69 T rade Fac i l itat ion Ag re ement Implementation of the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement continues to make  progress 

Over the past year, the WTO has received several additional acceptance instruments relating to the Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA), which aims to expedite the movement of goods across borders. The Agreement entered into force in February 2017 after two-thirds of WTO members had completed their domestic ratification process. As of end-June 2019, 145 WTO members had submitted their instruments of acceptance, constituting 88.4 per cent of all WTO members (see Chart 6.2). 

## WTO members’ notifications outline implementation plans 

Positive developments were also recorded with respect to the notifications in which developing and least-developed countries inform the WTO of their implementation plans for the Trade Facilitation Agreement. These help to form a roadmap of when the Agreement will be fully applied. Developed countries were required to implement all provisions immediately. The Agreement is expected to reduce trade costs by 14 per cent once it is fully implemented. By end-June 2019, a total of 114 members had submitted “category A” designations indicating the provisions of the Agreement they commit to implement immediately. A total of 77 members had submitted “category B” designations, identifying the provisions that will require additional implementation time. Sixty-five members had submitted “category C” designations, indicating where they will need additional time and capacity-building support to implement certain provisions (see Chart 6.3). Chart 6.2

## Implementation commitments received from over 62 per cent of members 

As of end-June 2019, the WTO had received implementation commitments from 62.5 per cent of WTO members. This comprises a 100 per cent commitment from developed members, 62.4% for developing countries and 24.9% for  least-developed countries (LDCs). Chapter VI: Trade policy developments 

71 Notifications on transparency and technical assistance are on the rise 

The past year has seen an increase in transparency notifications mandated under the TFA. By end-June 2019, 76 members had provided notifications under Article 1.4 (publication), 62 under Article 10.4.3 (operation of single window), 75 under Article 10.6.2 (use of customs brokers) and 68 under Article 12.2.2 (customs cooperation) – a noticeable increase compared with the previous year. Notifications on technical assistance and capacity-building support have also increased. By the end of June 2019, 15 members had informed the WTO of their aid-giving activities (Article 22.1) and eight had provided information on the process for obtaining their assistance (Article 22.2). Ten developing and least-developed countries had provided information on contact points for coordinating the receipt of support (Article 22.3). In terms of implementation commitments by developing countries and LDCs, the five TFA provisions with the highest implementation rate are: Article 9 (movement of goods under customs control), Article 10.5 (pre-shipment inspection), Article 10.6 (customs brokers), Article 5.2 (detention) and Article 10. 9 (temporary admission of goods – see Chart 6.6). The five TFA provisions with the lowest levels of commitment are Article 7.6 (average release times), Article 3 (advance rulings), Article 5.3 (test procedures), Article 7.7 (authorised operators) and Article 10.4 (single window – see Chart 6.7).

Transparency about the amount of duty to be paid at the border is improved when tariffs are expressed in ad valorem (percentage of the price) terms. Negotiations to convert non-ad valorem tariffs to AV tariffs are currently being pursued by WTO members. Of currently applied tariffs, 97 per cent are AV while the  remaining 3 per cent are non-AV (see Chart 6.9). However, for developed countries, the proportion of non-AV tariffs – which are mostly for agricultural products – is far higher, at 12 per cent, compared with other country groups. AV tariffs are therefore affected by changes in the price of imports. Generally, for specific duties, the AV tariff increases when the price of the product falls and the AV decreases as the product becomes more expensive. Chart 6.8 

Applied MFN tariffs, 2008-2018 

> Source: WTO Integrated Database (IDB).

# 1Average world MFN tariffs have declined by one percentage point since 2008. World tariffs continue to decline steadily 

World most-favoured-nation (MFN) tariffs have declined over the past ten years but at a very moderate rate (see Chart 6.8). Most-favoured-nation treatment is the principle of not discriminating between one’s trading partners and applying a common tariff to imports from other WTO members. Most of the recently announced tariff increases have been on a bilateral basis between specific trading partners and not at the global level. The world average applied tariff in 2018 was approximately 9 per cent, a one percentage point reduction from the level in 2008. This gradual decline is evident for developed, developing and least-developed countries. The magnitude of market access protection in terms of MFN tariffs is inversely correlated to development status, as shown in Chart 6.8. In other words, developed countries have lower tariffs compared with least-developed countries (LDCs), which have the highest applied MFN rates. The dip in average tariffs applied by developed countries in 2009-2010 was mainly due to changes in commodity prices, which were re fl ected in ad valorem equivalents (a tariff measured as a percentage of the price of the product) in the tariff schedules of developed countries.

73 WTO members account for 98 per cent of world imports, excluding trade within the European Union. For these importers, the level of MFN tariff that they apply at the border re fl ects the schedule of commitments negotiated during the member’s WTO accession. These tariffs are not allowed to breach the maximum or “bound” duty agreed for each import. The difference between the applied MFN tariff and the bound duty is referred to in WTO jargon as binding overhang, policy space or “water” in tariffs. Since the bound levels are already fixed, the binding overhang varies depending upon the level of applied tariffs at any given year. Another important indicator is the “binding coverage”, the percentage of products that have a tariff binding or a legal maximum. Chart 6.10 shows applied MFN tariffs and binding overhang for all WTO members, shown in four groups based on their level of binding coverage. The most open commitments are made by those with full or 100 per cent binding coverage and a very low level of bound duty, with zero or minimum binding overhang (shown on the extreme left of the chart). These members have low tariffs, which cannot go any higher because of their WTO commitments. In contrast, those members shown on the extreme right of the chart have a tariff binding for only a few products and relatively high tariff rates, resulting in an extensive binding overhang. With the  fl exibility to increase their tariffs at any time without violating their WTO commitments, market access to these markets is more limited and very unpredictable. Tariff negotiations at the WTO mostly focus on reducing members’ binding overhang and increasing their binding coverage to increase transparency and to create better market  access. Chart 6.9

The tariff ceiling for many WTO members, which is often far higher than their applied tariffs, and the high percentage of products that do not have a tariff ceiling contribute to a low level of transparency in international trade.

# Aid for T rade Aid for Trade disbursements over the past ten years amount to US$ 370.8 billion 

In 2017, the latest year for which data is available, Aid for Trade disbursements reached US$ 43.1 billion. This is a 102 per cent increase on the US$ 21.3 billion disbursed in 2007. Total disbursements over the past ten years amount to US$ 370.8 billion. Fifty per cent of disbursements supported economic infrastructure projects and 42 per cent were devoted to building productive capacity. The remaining disbursements were directed primarily to supporting trade policy making and regulations. Asia and Africa remain the main recipients of  funding (see Chart 6.11). The Aid for Trade Initiative aims to help developing economies use trade as a means of achieving economic growth and alleviating poverty. The initiative supports the integration of developing economies – and particularly least-developed countries – into the multilateral trading system by mobilizing international resources to address the constraints experienced by these countries. One of the key aims of the initiative is to enhance the capacity of developing economies to trade and to  take advantage of market access opportunities. The 2018-2019 Aid for Trade Work Programme on “Supporting Economic Diversification and Empowerment for Inclusive, Sustainable Development through Aid for Trade” seeks to further develop analysis of how Aid for Trade can contribute to economic diversification and empowerment with a focus on eliminating extreme poverty, particularly through the effective participation of women, young people, small businesses and rural populations.

75 T rade f i na nc e A large gap exists between supply and demand for trade finance 

Trade finance plays an indispensable role in oiling the wheels of trade. It is vital because exporters wish to be paid when goods are shipped while importers do not want to pay before they receive the merchandise. This can be a major problem in view of the fact that cargos from Europe to Asia may take up to 80 days. Financial institutions can help to bridge the gap between importers and exporters by providing payment solutions while taking the credit risk. Very little international trade is actually paid as cash in advance. The trade finance market is therefore sizable as the vast majority of the US$ 23 trillion worth of goods require a loan, payment guarantee or credit insurance to cross borders. Exporters and importers from least-developed countries tend to pay very high fees, which increase their costs of trade while traders from developed countries benefit from low interest rates and fees provided by international banks. According to the Bank for International Settlements, trade finance markets have been relatively concentrated with around 30 to 40 international banks operating global networks of distribution that allow them to supply trade finance almost anywhere around the world. Since the end of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, global banks have reduced their international networks of “correspondent banking relationships” which linked them with thousands of developing countries’ banks and allowed them to confirm letters of credit and receive trade payments from all over the world. According to the Financial Stability Board, about 200,000 of these relationships have disappeared out of a pre-crisis total of about 1 million. The number of relationships has declined for a number of reasons, ranging from the need to reduce costs to the challenge of complying with new international regulations that require a full upgrading of their due diligence over counterparty banks. This “de-risking” by global banks means that some parts of the world have become virtually isolated from  the international financial system. Small countries in the Pacific, the Caribbean and Africa now have only a handful of correspondent banking relationship and face severe challenges in obtaining confirmation of letters of credit. The large gap that now exists between supply and demand for trade finance is affecting poorer countries and smaller companies in particular, according to an annual survey of the Asian Development Bank (ADB). In many developing countries and most of the poorest countries, alternatives to bank financing are scarce. When financing requests are rejected by banks, trade transactions are abandoned, the ADB study says, with 60 per cent of trade finance requests by small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) being rejected. This persistent trade finance gap represents a significant barrier to trade and for the global integration of developing countries through trade. According to the World Economic Forum, lack of trade finance represents one of the top three obstacles for exporters for half of the countries in the world. In 2016, WTO Director-General Roberto Azevêdo launched a publication entitled “Trade Finance and SMEs – Bridging the Gap in Provision”. The publication highlighted potential steps to this end, including enhancing trade finance facilitation programmes by multilateral development banks, developing capacity-building to train professionals in local banking sectors on handling trade finance instruments and opening up a dialogue with trade finance regulators to take account of  new financial regulations. Since then, DG Azevêdo has worked with the heads of other international organizations to put these recommendations into practice. In June 2018, he announced to WTO members that multilateral development banks had stepped up their financing or guarantees for trade finance in the poorest parts in the world from US$ 22 billion in 2016 to about US$ 30 billion in 2018. The increased support has mainly benefitted SME traders. The Asian Development Bank alone supported trade transactions involving 3,500 SMEs in 2018. World Trade Statistical Review 2019 

76 To address knowledge gaps in local financial institutions, multilateral development banks and the WTO have been working with the International Chamber of Commerce to provide on-site training and e-learning opportunities. Over 1,000 have been trained annually, reaching 2,000 individuals in 2017 across 85 countries. In addition, DG Azevêdo and the CEO of the International Financial Corporation (World Bank Group), Philippe Le Houérou, have opened a dialogue with international regulators aimed at addressing some regulatory issues. In October 2018, DG Azevêdo and CEO Le Houérou co-hosted a session on financial inclusion in trade at the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in Bali, Indonesia. The meeting brought together the heads of partner institutions, such as multilateral development banks and regulators, to maintain momentum on addressing the trade finance gap. DG Azevêdo emphasized that the issue will require WTO members and international organizations to continue working together to achieve results. In July 2019, the WTO and IFC launched a new report showcasing international cooperation in addressing the trade finance gap. “Trade Finance and the Compliance Challenge: A Showcase of International Cooperation” underscores the vast trade finance gap of US$ 1.5 trillion that currently exists and looks into the reasons for the growing reluctance of the global financial sector to engage in trade financing. It highlights the challenge of regulatory compliance and the efforts made by international organizations, such as the WTO and the IFC, to address the issue. Case studies describe the capacity-building projects undertaken with multilateral development banks to help improve the availability of trade finance. The publication was launched by DG Azevêdo and CEO Le Houérou at the Aid  for  Trade Global Review at the WTO’s headquarters. 

> The availability of trade finance has become an increasingly important issue in the past few years. As international banks have become less willing to provide trade finance guarantees, particularly in developing countries, this has reduced the capacity of local banks to provide credit to businesses wishing to trade, leading to a significant gap between the demand and supply of trade finance. Small and medium-sized enterprises have been especially hard-hit by this trade finance gap. This publication delves into the global trade finance gap and the reasons for the growing reluctance of the global financial sector to engage in this form of financing. It examines the challenges of regulatory compliance and describes the efforts of international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization and the International Finance Corporation, to respond to this issue. It also presents case studies of the capacity-building programmes organized by multilateral development banks which aim to improve the availability of trade finance.

Products Merchandise trade 

Exports and imports 

Two systems of recording merchandise exports and imports are in common use. They are referred to as general trade and special trade and differ mainly in the way warehoused and re-exported goods are treated. General trade figures are larger than the corresponding special trade figures because the latter exclude certain trade  fl ows, such as goods shipped through bonded warehouses. To the extent possible, total merchandise trade is defined in this report according to the general trade definition. It covers all types of inward and outward movement of goods through a country or territory including movements through customs warehouses and free zones. Goods include all merchandise that either add to or subtract from the stock of material resources of a country or territory by entering (imports) or leaving (exports) the country’s economic territory. For further explanations, see United Nations International Trade Statistics, Concepts and Definitions, Series M, N° 52, Revision 2. Unless otherwise indicated, exports are valued at transaction value, including the cost of transportation and insurance to bring the merchandise to the frontier of the exporting country or territory (“free on board” valuation). Imports are valued at transaction value plus the cost of transportation and insurance to the frontier of the importing country or territory (“cost, insurance and freight” valuation).

## Products 

All product groups are defined according to Revision 3 of the Standard International Trade Classification (SITC). Throughout this report, other food products and live animals; beverages and tobacco; animal and vegetable oils, fats and waxes; oilseeds and oleaginous fruit are referred to as other food products; electronic data processing and office equipment is referred to as EDP and office equipment; and integrated circuits and electronic components is referred to as integrated circuits. Agricultural products according to the AOA (WTO Agreement on Agriculture) definition refer to HS chapters 1 to 24 (excluding fish and fish products) and a number of manufactured agricultural products (for further information see “The Legal Texts, The Results of the Uruguay Round of Multilateral Negotiations”, WTO). This definition does not correspond to the definition of agricultural products presented in the breakdown of merchandise trade by main  commodity group (see table II.1) 

## Merchandise trade and the goods account in balance of payments statistics 

Merchandise trade statistics serve as an input for the compilation of the goods account in the balance of payments (BOP) and the rest of the world account in the System of National Accounts (SNA). The compilation of international merchandise trade statistics (IMTS) relies principally on customs records complemented, as appropriate, by additional sources to enhance their coverage (for instance, to include electricity, or trade in vessels and aircrafts). These statistics essentially re fl ect the physical movement of goods across borders, while National Accounts and BOP statistics record transactions that involve change in ownership. Goods for processing with or without change of ownership are recorded in merchandise statistics when they enter or leave the economic territory, irrespective of whether a change in ownership takes place. However, goods supplied to another economy for processing without a change of ownership and returned to the economy of the owner after processing are not recorded in the balance of payments statistics compiled according to BPM6; further, if the goods are sold to a third economy after processing, then the value of the goods (including the value of processing) is recorded as an export of the economy of the owner and an import of the third economy; the value of the processing is recorded as an export of services of the processing economy and an import of services of the economy of the owner. Differences between BOP (BPM6) and national accounts statistics and IMTS can be found in the International Merchandise Trade Statistics: Compilers Manual, Revision 1 (IMTS 2010), Chapter XXIV Section B «Goods to be recorded differently in IMTS and BPM6/ national accounts» (p288). (https://unstats.un.org/unsd/trade/EG-IMTS/ IMTS2010-CM%20-%20white%20cover%20version.pdf) Refer to Table 11.1 (p177) in the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Compilation Guide (https:// www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/bop/2014/pdf/guide.pdf) World Trade Statistical Review 2019 

86 Trade in commercial services between residents and non-residents of an economy (BPM6) 

Depending on the location of the supplier and the consumer, the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) defines four modes of supply. In addition to the cross-border supply (mode 1), where both the supplier and the consumer remain in their respective home territories, GATS also covers cases where consumers are outside their home territory to consume services (mode 2 – consumption abroad), or where service suppliers are in the territory of the consumers to provide their services, whether by establishing affiliates through direct investment abroad (mode 3 – commercial presence), or through the presence of natural persons (mode 4). An economy’s Balance of Payments, namely the services account, can be used to derive estimates covering trade in commercial services for modes 1, 2 and 4. The Balance of Payments does however not include most of the information on services supplied through foreign affiliates that is required to estimate the size of mode 3. A framework for collecting these data, the “Foreign Affiliates Statistics (FATS)” was adopted by the international statistical community for the first time in 2002, and then further developed in 2010. 

## Trade in commercial services between residents and non-residents of an economy (BPM6), exports and imports 

Exports (credits or receipts) and imports (debits or payments) of commercial services are included in balance of payments statistics, in conformity with the concepts, definitions and classification of the sixth (2009) edition of the IMF Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) as well as the 2010 edition of the Manual on Statistics of International Trade in Services (MSITS 2010). 

Definition of commercial services in the Balance of  Payments 

In the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual, the current account is subdivided into goods, services (including government goods and services, n.i.e.), primary income, and secondary income. Commercial services comprise all services categories except government goods and services, n.i.e. Commercial services are sub-divided into goods-related services, transport, travel, and other commercial services. The BPM6 contains the following 12 standard services components. (1) Manufacturing services on physical inputs owned by others (2) Maintenance and repair services, n.i.e. (3) Transport (4) Travel (5) Construction (6) Insurance and pension services (7) Financial services (8) Charges for the use of intellectual property, n.i.e. (9) Telecommunications, computer and information services (10) Other business services (11) Personal, cultural and recreational services (12) Government goods and services, n.i.e. Manufacturing services on physical inputs owned by others cover processing, assembly, labelling, packing, and similar activities undertaken by enterprises that do not own the goods concerned and are paid a fee by the owner. Only the fee charged by the processor, which may cover the cost of materials purchased, is included under this item. Examples include oil refining, liquefaction of natural gas, assembly of clothing and electronics, assembly, labelling, and packing. Maintenance and repair services n.i.e. cover maintenance and repair work – by residents – on goods that are owned by non-residents (and vice versa). The repairs may be performed at the site of the repairer or elsewhere. The value recorded for maintenance and repairs is the value of the work done – not the gross value of the goods before and after repairs. Manufacturing services on physical inputs owned by others and Maintenance and repair services n.i.e. form a new WTO aggregate named “Goods-related services”. Transport is the process of carriage of people and objects from one location to another as well as related supporting and auxiliary services. Transport can be classified according to: (i) mode of transport, namely, sea, air, or other (“other” may be further broken down into rail, road, internal waterway, pipeline, and space transport as well as electricity transmission); and (ii) what is carried – passengers or freight. Also included are postal and courier services. Travel credits cover goods and services – for own use or to give away – acquired by non-residents from an economy during visits to that economy. Travel debits cover goods and services – for own use or to give away – acquired from other economies by residents of the reporting economy during visits to these other economies. The most common goods and services covered are lodging, food and beverages, entertainment and transportation (within the economy visited), gifts and souvenirs. Travel is further subdivided into: (i) personal travel and (ii) business travel. The aggregate category ‘‘Other commercial services’’ corresponds to the following components defined in BPM6: 

Construction covers the creation, renovation, repair, or extension of fixed assets in the form of buildings, land improvements of an engineering nature, and other similar engineering constructions such as roads, bridges, dams, and so forth. It also includes related installation and assembly work, site preparation, specialized services such as painting, plumbing, and demolition, and management of construction projects. Construction also covers the acquisition of goods and services by the enterprises undertaking construction work from the economy of location of the construction work. Construction can be divided into (i) construction abroad and (ii) construction in the compiling economy. Chapter VII: Composition, definitions & methodology 

87 Insurance and pension services include services of providing life insurance and annuities, nonlife insurance, reinsurance, freight insurance, pensions, standardized guarantees, and auxiliary services to insurance, pension schemes, and standardized guarantee schemes. Financial services cover financial intermediary and auxiliary services, except insurance and pension fund services, provided by banks and other financial corporations. They include deposit taking and lending, letters of credit, credit card services, commissions and charges related to financial leasing, factoring, underwriting, and clearing of payments. Also included are financial advisory services, custody of financial assets or bullion, financial asset management, monitoring services, liquidity provision services, risk assumption services other than insurance, merger and acquisition services, credit rating services, stock exchange services, and trust services. Financial services may be charged for by: (i) explicit charges; (ii) margins on buying and selling transactions; (iii) asset management costs deducted from property income receivable in the case of asset-holding entities; or (iv) margins between interest payable and the reference rate on loans and deposits (called financial intermediation service charges indirectly measured – FISIM). Charges for the use of intellectual property n.i.e. include: (i) Charges for the use of proprietary rights (such as patents, trademarks, copyrights, industrial processes and designs including trade secrets, franchises); these rights can arise from research and development, as well as from marketing; and (ii) Charges for licenses to reproduce or distribute (or both) intellectual property embodied in produced originals or prototypes (such as copyrights on books and manuscripts, computer software, cinematographic works, and sound recordings) and related rights (such as for live performances and television, cable, or satellite broadcast). For the purpose of this report, all references to intellectual property (IP) services or intellectual property related services refer only to “Charges for the use of intellectual property n.i.e.”. Telecommunications, computer and information services cover (i) Telecommunications services, which encompass the broadcast or transmission of sound, images, data, or other information by telephone, telex, telegram, radio and television cable transmission, radio and television satellite, electronic mail, facsimile, and so forth, including business network services, teleconferencing, and support services; (ii) Computer services consisting of hardware- and software-related services and data processing services; (iii) Information services including news agency services, such as the provision of news, photographs, and feature articles to the media as well as database services. Other business services include (i) Research and development services, (ii) Professional and management consulting services and (iii) Technical, trade-related and other business services. (i) Research and development services consist of services that are associated with basic and applied research, and experimental development of new products and processes. (ii) Professional and management consulting services include (a) legal services, accounting, management consulting, managerial services, and public relations services; and (b) advertising, market research, and public opinion polling services. (iii) Technical, trade-related, and other business services include: (a) architectural, engineering, and other technical services; (b) waste treatment and depollution, agricultural, and mining services; (c) operating leasing services; (d) trade-related services; and (e) other business services n.i.e. Personal, cultural, and recreational services consist of (i) Audio-visual and related services and (ii) other personal, cultural, and recreational services. (i) Audio-visual and related services cover services and fees related to the production of motion pictures (on film, videotape, disk, or transmitted electronically, etc.), radio and television programs (live or on tape), and musical recordings. (ii) Other personal, cultural, and recreational services include (a) health services, (b) education services, (c) heritage and recreational services, and (d) other personal services. Health services as well as education services are provided remotely or on-site. Data on exports and imports of total services (including government goods and services n.i.e), other services (including government goods and services n.i.e) as well as government goods and services n.i.e. are available as memorandum items in the WTO Data Portal. Memo items: – Total services (Commercial services plus Government goods and services n.i.e) – Other services (Other commercial services plus Government goods and services n.i.e) – Government goods and services n.i.e Government goods and services n.i.e. cover: (a) goods and services supplied by and to enclaves, such as embassies, military bases, and international organizations; (b) goods and services acquired from the host economy by diplomats, consular staff, and military personnel located abroad and their dependents; (c) services supplied by and to governments and not included in other categories of services. Statistics on international trade in services are produced jointly and published simultaneously with UNCTAD and ITC. 

Coverage and comparability 

While many economies worldwide have fully implemented the BPM6 for the recording of their Balance of Payments services transactions, some are still compiling their statistics according to the BPM5 methodology. Consequently, comparability and coverage of data may not always be complete. It should be noted in particular that world and regional estimates of trade in new services items such as Manufacturing services on physical inputs owned by others and Maintenance and repair services n.i.e. may be underestimated, as some economies do not report these items yet. While the coverage and comparability of trade in services statistics have improved significantly over the years, the data remain subject to recognized limitations, such as i) certain countries do not collect figures for all items, ii) statistically capturing some services items remains difficult (more notably on the imports side), iii) data can be reported on a net rather than gross basis, iv) certain transactions may prove complex to classify appropriately, v) different sources, data collection and estimation methods lead to diverse results, etc. These distortions are more significant on detailed items levels and may lead to considerable asymmetries among countries’ reported trade  fl ows by origin and destination. World Trade Statistical Review 2019 

88 Foreign Affiliates Statistics 

The new statistical framework on Foreign Affiliates Statistics (FATS) is developed in the Manual on Statistics of International Trade in Services 2010, the OECD Benchmark Definition of Foreign Direct Investment and the OECD Handbook on Economic Globalisation Indicators. The statistical framework covers both goods and services producing enterprises. It analyses the universe of affiliates for which foreign investors own more than 50 per cent of the voting power or equity interest. Depending on the compiler’s view, one can distinguish inward FATS, that is, activities of foreign-owned affiliates in the compiling economy, or, outward FATS, that is, foreign affiliates of the compiling economy active abroad. Variables such as sales, value added, number of employees, etc. are used to describe the affiliates’ activities. These variables are broken down by country of origin or destination of investments and also by type of primary activity of the affiliates. The United States also provide a breakdown into total supply of goods and total supply of services products. In the case of services industries the concept of supply (or output) is based on measures that better capture service output (i.e. the margin). This mainly has an impact on the measurement of activities of wholesalers and retailers, insurers and financial intermediaries. From a GATS perspective, the size of  mode 3 in a given country can be approximated through the value of the output (or supply) of services by foreign-owned affiliates. In the absence of data on output, sales of services are used. FATS are currently available mainly for OECD and a small number of non-OECD economies. Given the recent development of these statistics, comparability and coverage of individual economy data may not always be complete. Availability of detailed data and long-time series varies considerably between economies. 

## Trade in global value chains 

The measurement of trade in value added terms traces the source of the value added, by country and industry that is contained in the products (goods and services) traded across the world. Value added is defined as the value that is added by industries to produce goods and services. In a national account sense, it re fl ects the compensation of labour, capital, nonfinancial assets and natural resources used in the production as well as net indirect taxes, when relevant. The value-added approach re fl ects the interconnection of economies and sectors as well as the increasing importance of trade in intermediate inputs that takes place among international supply and production chains. It provides insights on where the value added comes from and thus on the actual contribution of trade to economies. Trade in value added indicators are estimates based on Inter-Country Input-Output (ICIO) tables. ICIO tables cover both goods and services. They regroup national Input-Output tables and international trade statistics into a consistent framework to describe sale and purchase of goods and services between producers and consumers from various economies and industries. They enable to disentangle domestic and foreign value added in each economy and industry. Trade in value added estimates presented in this publication are sourced from the OECD “Trade in value added” (TiVA) database and the OECD ICIO table. The latter covers 57 economies plus a “rest of the world” aggregate. Industries are regrouped into 37 sectors and cover productive activities in the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors classified according to the International Standard Industrial Classification (ISIC) Revision 4. 

The decomposition of gross exports into their value-added components 

The breakdown of conventional export data (gross) into their value-added components allows showing the role played by economies in global value chains. The domestic value-added content of exports is composed of the following indicators: (i) The domestic value added, embodied either in final or intermediate goods/services, directly consumed by the importing country. This represents a one-to-one country transfer of value added, with exported goods/services crossing borders only once. (ii) The domestic value added contained in intermediates exported to a first country which re-exports them to a third country as embodied in other goods/services. This indicator represents a one-to-many country transfer of value added, when exported goods/ services cross borders more than once. This illustrates the level of participation of an economy within international production. (iii) The domestic value added of exported goods/services which is eventually re-imported by the country itself. Such a value added round-trip between two countries highlights the domestic value-added content present in a country’s imports. The foreign value-added content of exports corresponds to the value added of inputs that was imported in order to produce intermediate or final goods/services to be exported. It can also be referred to as vertical specialization, when expressed in percentage. 

The sectoral value-added contributions to gross exports 

Exports from a (domestic) industry do not only contain value added produced within the same industry but also value added sourced from other industries within the economy or from other economies. The value-added approach to estimate trade  fl ows can describe both the geographical and sectoral origin of the value added contained in gross exports of any given industry. Table IV.3 presents the value-added origin (columns) of gross exports (rows) according to the domestic and foreign source and by main sector. This highlights the extent of the global value chains phenomenon and outlines the interconnection and related dependency across countries and sectors for the production and trade of goods and services.

Annual changes 

Throughout this report, average annual percentage changes are analogous to compound interest rates. In calculating the average annual rate of change between 2010 and 2018, for example, data for calendar year 2010 were taken as the starting point, and data for calendar year 2018 as the end  point. 

Prices 

Commodity price movements are primarily described by indices largely based on spot market prices, and therefore exclude transactions governed by longer-term contracts. Price indices for such commodities as food, beverages, agricultural raw materials, minerals, non-ferrous metals, fertilizers and crude petroleum are obtained from IMF Primary Commodity Prices (May 2019 release). Aggregates for all primary commodities and for non-fuel primary commodities are calculated using IMF weights (Statistical appendix table A67). Beginning with the first quarter of 2011 to the fourth quarter of 2015, the crude oil price is computed excluding West Texas Intermediate (WTI), which accounts for one third of the IMF’s crude oil index. The price of WTI became largely dislocated from international markets in early 2011 and is thought not to represent well prices in international oil trade. For more information, see Box Comm.1 of the World Bank’s Global Commodity Market Outlook, January 2012 (see page 3 of the complete report on http:// siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPROSPECTS/ Resources/334934-1322593305595/8287139-1326 374900917/GEP2012A_Commodity_Appendix.pdf) 

World merchandise trade indices 

The volume indices and the de fl ators (i.e. price indices or unit values) are taken from a range of different international and national sources. The reported de fl ators and volume indices may not always be available for the most recent years or may differ in product coverage from the corresponding value indices. Aggregation of the indices to obtain a world total is a two-tier process. First, export and import de fl ators from national and international sources are complemented with WTO and UNCTAD estimates for missing data. They are then aggregated to obtain regional totals. The volume index for each region is obtained by dividing the respective trade value index for each region by the corresponding regional de fl ator. Second, the total world merchandise volume index is obtained by de fl ating the world trade value with the aggregate of regional de fl ators. Throughout the aggregation process trade values of the previous year are used as weights. 

World gross domestic product 

World GDP growth is estimated as a weighted average of individual economies’ real GDP growth. The weights used are shares of the economies’ previous year GDP at 2005 constant prices converted to dollars at market exchange rates. The use of official exchange rates which are not market-based for some major economies, together with the 

fl uctuations of the United States dollar vis-à-vis major currencies, can have a significant impact on the weighting pattern. The increasing use of weights based on purchasing power parities (PPP) by other international organizations is meant to attenuate “anomalies” linked to these factors. In a period of widely diverging growth rates among countries and regions, the choice of the weighting pattern can have a marked in fl uence on the global growth estimate. For the 2000-2011 period, global growth estimates based on PPP-weights indicate a significantly faster growth than estimates using weights based on GDP data measured at market exchange rates. This is because of differences in the two weighting patterns. 

Re-exports and re-imports 

Under the system of general trade adopted in this report, re-exports are included in total merchandise trade. However, in the case of Hong Kong, China, the magnitude of its re-exports (amounting in 2018 to US$ 556 billion), if included in regional or world aggregates, would adversely affect the analytical value of the statistics by introducing a significant element of double counting. Therefore, Hong Kong, China’s re-exports are excluded from the world, Asia and developing economies aggregates (unless otherwise indicated); only Hong Kong, China’s domestic exports and retained imports are included in the totals.

90 Indicators tracking the changes in the application of trade policy measures can be broken down into three broad categories: (1)  Customs related measures: Information on customs duties (bound, applied and preferential) can be found on the WTO website and also in a summary form in the World Tariff Profiles. Information on the changes in customs duties can be derived from the above sources but these changes are also covered by the Trade Monitoring reports (TM). (2)  Trade remedies: Binding tariffs and applying them equally to all trading partners (most-favoured-nation treatment) are key to the smooth  fl ow of trade in goods. The WTO agreements uphold the principles, but they also allow derogations in some circumstances. Those “trade remedies” cover antidumping, countervailing duties and safeguards; the relevant information can be found in the I-TIP database and also in the TM database. (3)  Technical measures / regulations: By far a persistent growth in notifications happened in the area of regulations and standards which fall under the SPS and TBT agreements. Keeping up to date with these measures is crucial for all trading partners. Notifications in this area are not easily comparable as to the trade impact of the respective measures announced and the number of notifications may overestimate the actual implementation of the measures. For each of these three categories, the secretariat compiles indicators showing the measures that were introduced or modified in the year and, when applicable, the stock of these measures. WTO members have established two main ways of obtaining the relevant information on trade policy measures, one being the system of notifications and the other one being the trade policy reviews’ reports and, related to it, the trade monitoring reports. Through notifications, WTO members and observers provide the Secretariat with recent relevant information on trade and trade-related measures. In the trade monitoring context, the Secretariat in addition to information received by WTO members and observers, collects trade and trade-related measures from other relevant sources and subsequently submit it to the relevant member for verification. The preparation of the trade monitoring reports is an on-going activity and a unique process relying on continuous dialogue and exchange with WTO delegations as well as divisions within the WTO Secretariat. The WTO-wide trade monitoring reports are subsequently discussed at meetings of the WTO’s Trade Policy Review Body. The verification process is a unique feature of the WTO’s monitoring efforts and represents a quality control mechanism, allowing members to check the accuracy of the information before it is made public. Information contained in members’ notifications is now in large parts included in a consolidated database platform, the Integrated Trade Intelligence Portal (I-TIP, https://www.wto.org/english/ res_e/statis_e/itip_e.htm).

91 Merchandise trade statistics of the European Union 

Beginning with the 2002 report, EU data compiled according to national statistical practices have been replaced, starting 1993, with data compiled by Eurostat in accordance with EU legislation. The concepts and definitions adopted by the EU are in line with the United Nations’ International Trade Statistics, Concepts and Definitions, Series M, N° 52, Revision 2. As a result, the conceptual differences between EU member states’ data have been substantially reduced. Moreover, for the EU as a whole, Eurostat data are more timely than the previous source, thus reducing substantially the amount of estimation included in the EU aggregate. Since January 1993, statistics on the trade between the member states of the EU have been collected through the “Intrastat” system (see GATT 1994, International Trade Trends and Statistics). The coverage of this system, which relies on reports submitted by firms for transactions above a minimum value, is not as wide as the previous one, which was based on customs declarations. This is particularly noticeable on the import side. For example, prior to the adoption of the Intrastat system, reported intra-EU imports (c.i.f.) closely matched reported intra-EU exports (f.o.b.). However, from 1993 onwards, the reported value of intra-EU imports has been on average around 3 per cent lower than the value of intra-EU exports, indicating a substantial under-reporting of intra-EU imports. As a result of this inconsistency, the Secretariat has substituted intra-EU exports data for intra-EU imports at the aggregate EU level when estimating regional and world totals. However, this adjustment is not allocated between EU member countries. Hence, the sum of reported imports of individual EU members does not add to the figure for EU imports as a whole. This adjustment is also re fl ected in the volume estimates for the EU as a whole. 

Major breaks in data continuity of merchandise trade 

Beginning 2003, Singapore includes merchandise trade with Indonesia. Beginning 2008, Indonesia’s imports are reported according to the general trade system. With respect to the Russian Federation, considerable uncertainty remains about the accuracy of foreign trade statistics, especially as regards imports. A large proportion of the reported data on imports consists of official estimates of in fl ows of goods which enter the economy without being registered by the customs authorities. Such adjustments to import data accounted for 6 per cent of the officially reported totals in 2012; 8 per cent of the officially reported totals in 2013. As of 2012, data on merchandise trade values for Switzerland includes trade in gold. Merchandise trade  fl ows between the European Union member States include trade associated with fraudulent VAT declaration, which concerns mainly office and telecommunications equipment. Between 2006 and 2007, intra-EU merchandise trade statistics have been particularly affected by a considerable reduction in this fraudulent trade in the United Kingdom.

World Bank, World Development Indicators Figures for total merchandise trade are largely derived from national authorities supplemented by international databases and Secretariat estimates. Data on merchandise trade by origin, destination and product are mainly obtained from Eurostat’s Comext database, the Trade Data Monitor and UNSD’s Comtrade database. Some inconsistencies in the aggregate export and import data for the same country or territory between sources are inevitable. These can be attributed to the use of different systems of recording trade, to the way in which for example IMF and UNSD have converted data expressed in national currencies into dollars, and revisions which can be more readily incorporated in the IMF data. Statistics on trade in commercial services are mainly drawn from the IMF Balance of Payments Statistics or from the Trade in Services by Partner Country dataset of the OECD. Data for European Union members, as well as the EU(28) aggregate are drawn from Eurostat’s on-line database. For other economies that do not report to the IMF (e.g., Chinese Taipei) data are drawn from national sources. Estimations for missing data are mainly based on national statistics. GDP series in current dollars are mainly derived from the IMF World Economic Outlook database.

> Note: Breaks in the continuity of the value series for particular countries and regional groupings are indicated by an 'I'. They result mainly from changes in the methods of collecting and reporting merchandise trade statistics. It should be noted that the World and Asia totals contain a significant element of double counting due to the use of the general system of recording merchandise trade statistics which includes re-exports.

(2) Imports are valued f.o.b. Recent figures for a number of countries and territories have been estimated by the Secretariat.  

> Note: Breaks in the continuity of the value series for particular countries and regional groupings are indicated by an 'I'. They result mainly from changes in the methods of collecting and reporting merchandise trade statistics. It should be noted that the World and Asia totals contain a significant element of double counting due to the use of the general system of recording merchandise trade statistics which includes re-exports.
