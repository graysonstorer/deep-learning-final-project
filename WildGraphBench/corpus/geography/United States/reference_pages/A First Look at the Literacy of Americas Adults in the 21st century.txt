# Average Prose and Document Literacy Scores Rise for Blacks and Asians But Decrease Among Hispanics 

The 2003 National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) measures the English literacy of America's adults (people age 16 and older living in households or prisons).The average quantita-tive literacy scores of adults increased 8 points between 1992 and 2003, though average prose and document literacy did not differ significantly from 1992 (figure 1). Among Blacks, average prose literacy scores increased by 6 points and average document literacy scores rose by 8 points between 1992 and 2003 (figure 1).The average prose scores of Asians/Pacific Islanders increased as well, rising 16 points between 1992 and 2003.The average prose literacy scores of Hispanics fell 18 points from 1992 to 2003, while average document lit-eracy scores decreased by 14 points. Average prose and document literacy scores among Whites did not change significantly. (Differences are discussed in this report only if they were found to be statistically significant at the .05 level. Standard errors for all tables and figures in this report are available on the NAAL website.) 

* Significantly different from 1992. NOTE: Adults are defined as people 16 years of age and older living in households or prisons.Adults who could not be interviewed due to language spoken or cognitive or men-tal disabilities (3 percent in 2003 and 4 percent in 1992) are excluded from this figure.In 1992, respondents were allowed to identify only one race.In 2003, respondents were allowed to identify multiple races.In 2003, 2 percent of respondents identified multiple races and are not included in the White, Black, or Asian/Pacific Islander categories in this figure.All adults of Hispanic origin are classified as Hispanic, regardless of race.The Asian/Pacific Islander category includes Native Hawaiians.Total includes White, Black, Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Multiracial/Other.Although not reported separately, American Indians/Native Alaskans are included.

# Assessment Design 

The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) asked the National Research Council’s Board on Testing and Assessment (BOTA) to recommend a set of literacy levels for the 2003 assessment that would permit compar-isons with results from the 1992 assessment. Drawing on recommendations from BOTA’s Committee on Performance Levels for Adult Literacy, NCES has decided to report the assessment results by using four literacy levels. Descriptions of the abilities associated with each level and the types of tasks that adults at each level could complete are presented in table 1 on the following page.The complete BOTA report explaining their methodology in setting levels is available on the Web at http://books.nap.edu/ catalog/11267.html. 

# Description of Literacy Levels Defining Literacy 

The assessment defines litera-cy as “using printed and writ-ten information to function in society, to achieve one’s goals, and to develop one’s knowl-edge and potential.” Results are reported on three literacy scales (see Sample Assessment Questions section of the report): PPr ro os se e L Li it te er ra ac cy yThe knowledge and skills needed to perform prose tasks (i.e., to search, compre-hend, and use information from continuous texts). DDo oc cu um me en nt t L Li it te er ra ac cy yThe knowledge and skills needed to perform document tasks (i.e., to search, compre-hend, and use information from noncontinuous texts in various formats). QQu ua an nt ti it ta at ti iv ve e L Li it te er ra ac cy yThe knowledge and skills required to perform quantita-tive tasks (i.e., to identify and perform computations, either alone or sequentially, using numbers embedded in print-ed materials). 

Unlike indirect measures of literacy, which rely on self-reports of literacy skills or educational attainment, the assessment measures literacy by asking respondents to demon-strate that they understand the meaning of information found in texts they are asked to read. The literacy tasks in the assess-ment were drawn from actual texts and documents, which were either used in their orig-inal format or reproduced in the assessment booklets. Each question appeared before the materials needed to answer it, thus encouraging respondents to read with purpose. Respondents could correctly answer many assessment ques-tions by skimming the text or document for the informa-tion necessary to perform a given literacy task. All tasks were open-ended. A total of 152 prose, docu-ment, and quantitative literacy tasks were included in the 2003 assessment. Sixty-five of the tasks were taken from the 1992 survey and 87 were developed for the 2003 assess-ment.Tasks from the 1992 survey were included in the 2003 assessment to measure changes in literacy between 1992 and 2003. Asking each respondent to complete all the tasks would be too time-consuming, so the tasks were organized into 13 unique blocks. Respondents were asked to complete an assessment booklet that included seven literacy screen-ing tasks (with questions asked in either English or Spanish but based upon written mate-rials presented in English only) common to all booklets, fol-lowed by three blocks of tasks. Adults who were unable to answer a minimum number of literacy screening tasks, but who were able to communi-cate in either English or Spanish, were administered an alternative assessment with questions asked orally in either English or Spanish based upon printed materials presented in English only. Adults who were not screened into the alterna-tive assessment and completed the main assessment attempted approximately 40 literacy tasks (administered in English only). To compare results between 1992 and 2003, the 1992 results were rescaled using the criteria and methods estab-lished for the 2003 assessment. The assessment also included a background questionnaire that was used to collect data about the relationship between liter-acy and various demographic and background characteris-tics.The background question-naire was administered before the assessment and the ques-tions were asked orally in either English or Spanish. See Population and Sample Size, and Data Collection Procedures section of this report for more information about the assessment.

A First Look at the Literacy of America’s Adults in the 21 st Century 

The percentage of adults (people age 16 and older liv-ing in households or prisons) with Below Basic document literacy decreased 2 percent-age points between 1992 and 2003 and the percentage of adults with Below Basic quan-titative literacy decreased by 4 percentage points (figure 2). The percentage of adults with 

Basic literacy did not change significantly between 1992 and 2003 on any of the three scales.The percentage of adults with Intermediate docu-ment literacy increased by 4 percentage points and the percentage of adults with 

Intermediate quantitative litera-cy increased by 3 percentage points.The percentage of adults with Proficient prose and document literacy decreased 2 percentage points between 1992 and 2003.

# Nonliterate in English 4

An additional component of the adult population (defined as people age 16 and older liv-ing in households or prisons) is not shown in figure 2. Field interviewers determined that 2 percent of adults in 2003 and 3 percent in 1992 could not be tested because they spoke a language other than English or Spanish and were unable to communicate in English or Spanish.These adults are included in the population that is the basis for the per-centages in figure 3, but not in the population of adults that is the basis for figure 2 and the other figures in this report, because there is little or no background data on adults who could not be tested. In 2003, about 3 percent of adults took an alternative assessment because they were unable to complete a mini-mum number of simple liter-acy screening questions.These adults also performed in the 

Below Basic category in figure 2. Questions on the alterna-tive assessment were asked in either English or Spanish, but all written materials were in English only.While some of these individuals were able to identify letters, numbers, and simple words and phrases, most were unable to read and understand connected text in English.These adults are also nonliterate in English. For 2003, these two groups of adults who were nonliterate in English—the 2 percent who could not be tested because they could not com-municate in English or Spanish and the 3 percent who received the alternative assessment—account for 5 percent of the population (11 million). For 1992, the corresponding percentage could not be estimated. An unknown proportion of the 

Below Basic population in that year would have required such an alternative assessment, but it was not available then. In addition to the adults who could not be tested because of a language difficulty (3 per-cent in 1992 and 2 percent in 2003), other adults could not be tested because of a cogni-tive or mental disability that precluded conducting the interview (1 percent in 1992 and 1 percent in 2003).

A First Look at the Literacy of America’s Adults in the 21 st Century 

In 2003, 14 percent of American adults (defined as people age 16 and older liv-ing in households or prisons) had Below Basic prose litera-cy (figure 2). Examining the characteristics of these adults provides a profile of the adults with the lowest prose literacy performance. Hispanics, who represent 12 percent of the NAAL popula-tion, accounted for 39 per-cent of the adults with Below Basic prose literacy (table 2). Twenty percent of adults with 

Below Basic prose literacy were Black. In contrast, while 70 percent of the NAAL population is White, 37 per-cent of adults with Below Basic prose literacy were White. Adults age 65 or older repre-sent 15 percent of the NAAL population but 26 percent of adults in the lowest prose lit-eracy level (table 2). Although 35 percent of adults with 

Below Basic prose literacy spoke Spanish or Spanish and another non-English language before starting school, these individuals account for 8 per-cent of the population. Adults without a high school degree or GED represent 15 percent of the total NAAL population but 55 percent of the adults in the lowest prose literacy level (table 2). Fifty-two percent of adults in the total NAAL population com-pleted at least some educa-tion beyond high school, compared to 14 percent of adults with Below Basic prose literacy. Forty-six percent of adults with Below Basic prose literacy had one or more disabilities, compared to 30 percent of adults in the NAAL popula-tion (table 2).The percentage of adults with multiple dis-abilities in the Below Basic 

prose level (21 percent) was significantly higher than the percentage of adults with multiple disabilities in the NAAL population (9 per-cent).

# Profile of Adults With Below Basic Prose Literacy 5In 2003, average prose literacy and average document litera-cy were higher for women than for men, while average quantitative literacy was high-er for men than for women (figure 4). Between 1992 and 2003, the average prose score for women remained at 277, while the average prose score for men decreased by 4 points (figure 4). On the doc-ument literacy scale, women gained 4 points between 1992 and 2003, while the average score for men dropped by 5 points. In 2003, the average quanti-tative literacy score for women increased 10 points from 1992, while average quantitative literacy for men was not significantly different from 1992 (figure 4). The distribution of men and women across the literacy lev-els also changed between 1992 and 2003 (figures 5, 6, and 7).

On the quantitative scale, for example, the percentage of men and women with Below Basic literacy decreased between 1992 and 2003 (fig-ure 7). For men, the percent-age with Below Basic quantita-tive literacy declined by 3 per-centage points, while the per-centage of women with Below Basic quantitative literacy fell by 6 percentage points. The percentage of women with Below Basic document literacy also decreased, from 14 percent in 1992 to 11 percent in 2003 (figure 6). Despite the overall gain made by women in quantitative lit-eracy, in 2003, the percentage of men with Proficient quanti-tative literacy was 5 percent-age points higher than the percentage of women (figure 7). For the prose and docu-ment scales, there were no significant differences between the percentage of men and women with Proficient literacy (figures 5 and 6). The percentage of Whites, Blacks, and Asians/Pacific Islanders with Below Basic lit-eracy decreased between 1992 and 2003 on the prose, document, and quantitative scales (figures 8, 9, and 10). Among Hispanics, the per-centage with Below Basic 

prose literacy increased 9 percentage points between 1992 and 2003, while the percentage with Below Basic 

document literacy increased 8 percentage points (figures 8 and 9).The percentage of Hispanics with Below Basic 

quantitative literacy was 50 percent in both 1992 and 2003 (figure 10). Although the percentage of Hispanics with Below Basic

The aging of America’s adults is reflected in the increase in the percentage of adults between the ages of 40 and 49 and between the ages of 50 and 64. While the percentage of adults in these age groups rose between 1992 and 2003, the percentage of adults between the ages of 19 and 24 and between 25 and 39 decreased. 

10 34 percent had Below Basic 

quantitative literacy. Average prose literacy scores for adults in the 25 to 39 and 40 to 49 age groups fell from 1992 to 2003 (figure 11). Average document literacy decreased for adults ages 40 to 49, while the average quantitative literacy of adults ages 25 to 39 increased. Average literacy for adults in the 16 to 18 and 19 to 24 age groups was not signifi-cantly different in 1992 and 2003 across the literacy scales (figure 11). Among adults ages 50 to 64, the percentage with Proficient 

prose, document, and quanti-tative literacy increased between 1992 and 2003 (figures 12 and 13; quantita-tive data not shown).The percentage of adults age 65 and older with Proficient liter-acy did not change on any of the three scales between 1992 and 2003.

Among adults who spoke Spanish or Spanish and another non-English lan-guage before starting school, the percentage with Below Basic prose and document lit-eracy increased between 1992 and 2003 (figures 15 and 16). Average document literacy in 2003 was highest for the English-language-only group (figure 14). Prose and quanti-tative literacy did not differ significantly between the English-language-only and the English and other lan-guage groups. In 2003, among adults who spoke Spanish or Spanish and another non-English language before starting school, 61 per-cent had Below Basic prose lit-eracy, 49 percent had Below Basic document literacy, and 62 percent had Below Basic 

quantitative literacy (figures 15 and 16; quantitative data not shown). 

13 Average prose literacy decreased for all levels of edu-cational attainment between 1992 and 2003, with the exception of adults who were still in high school or com-pleted a GED (table 7). Average document literacy also decreased among adults who completed education above a vocational, trade, or business school. Differences in document literacy in 1992 and 2003 were not significant for adults with educational attainment less than some college.There were no signif-icant differences in average quantitative literacy between 1992 and 2003 for any edu-cational attainment level. In 2003, literacy was lowest across the three scales for adults who did not complete high school; these adults also accounted for the largest group with Below Basic prose, document, and quantitative lit-eracy (tables 7 and 8). On the quantitative scale, for example, over 60 percent of adults without a high school degree had Below Basic literacy.

In 2003, prose, document, and quantitative literacy rose with successive levels of educational attainment beginning with the completion of high school (table 7). Average prose, docu-ment, and quantitative literacy for adults who completed a GED was not significantly different from that of adults who stopped their education after graduating high school. The declining performance of adults with higher education-al attainment was reflected in the decrease between 1992 and 2003 in the percentage of adults with postsecondary degrees with Proficient prose and document literacy (table 8). On the prose scale, the percentage of college gradu-ates with Proficient literacy decreased from 40 percent in 1992 to 31 percent in 2003. For adults who took graduate classes or completed a gradu-ate degree, the percentage with Proficient prose literacy fell 10 percentage points between 1992 and 2003. The distribution of adults across the four literacy levels on the quantitative scale did not change significantly between 1992 and 2003 within any of the educational attainment categories.

Basic Below Basic Intermediate Proficient The ability to complete dif-ferent literacy tasks may influ-ence employability, so it is useful to look at the distribu-tion of adults by literacy lev-els across the four categories of employment. Among adults with Below Basic prose litera-cy, 51 percent were not in the labor force in 2003, while 35 percent were employed full time (figure 17; results for the document and quantitative scales are not shown here but are available on the NAAL website). The percentage of adults with Below Basic prose litera-cy who were employed full time increased 6 percentage points between 1992 and 2003, and the percentage with Below Basic document literacy who were employed full time increased 5 percent-age points (figure 17; docu-ment and quantitative results not shown). For adults with 

Basic prose literacy, 38 per-cent were not in the labor force and 6 percent were unemployed. Sixty-four percent of adults with Proficient prose literacy and 54 percent of adults with 

Intermediate prose literacy were employed full time (figure 17). Eighteen percent

of adults with Proficient prose literacy and 27 percent of adults with Intermediate prose literacy were not in the labor force; 3 percent of adults with 

Proficient prose literacy and 5 percent of adults with 

Intermediate prose literacy were unemployed. Among adults employed full time, average prose and docu-ment literacy scores decreased by 5 points between 1992 and 2003, while average quantitative scores rose by 4 points (figure 18). Average quantitative literacy also increased between 1992 and 2003 for adults employed part time and those not in the labor force. In 2003, average prose and document literacy was high-est among adults employed full or part time (the differ-ences between these groups were not statistically signifi-cant), and average quantita-tive literacy was highest for adults employed full time (figure 18). Literacy was low-est across the three scales for adults who were not in the labor force.

The 2003 assessment was administered to a nationally representative sample of 19,714 adults ages 16 and older residing in households or prisons. A smaller number of respon-dents (1,173) were selected for the prison sample and were interviewed in the facil-ities where they were incar-cerated. Sampled adults resid-ing in households, but tem-porarily in jail—where the median stay is about two weeks—would have been interviewed at some other time during the ten month period of data collection. The household sample is rep-resentative of the 221,020,000 adults in households, while the prison sample is represen-tative of the 1,380,000 adults in prisons in 2003. Data collection for the household sample was con-ducted between May 2003 and February 2004 and for the prison sample between March 2004 and July 2004. The household and prison samples were combined to create a national sample rep-resentative of the 222,400,000 American adults in house-holds or prisons. Administration procedures for the 2003 assessment were changed to provide more accurate data about English literacy levels of adults. One change was designed to increase the number of Spanish speaking adults who could participate in the study. In 1992, the easy literacy tasks at the beginning of the assess-ment were presented in English only. In 2003, the corresponding tasks were pre-sented in either English or Spanish, although the materi-als to be read were presented only in English. As a result, fewer adults had to be excluded due to the language of the interview. A second change was designed to make the assess-ment more like the demands of everyday life. In 1992, respondents were not allowed to use a calculator for most quantitative literacy questions. In 2003, respondents had access to a calculator. Allowing respondents to use calculators is consistent with the assessment's functional definition of literacy. Both of these changes require some caution in interpreting the changes in literacy levels from 1992 to 2003, but result in the ability of the 2003 assess-ment to provide more accu-rate data about the English literacy levels of adults. The final household sample response rate was 62 percent and the final prison sample response rate was 88 percent. NCES statistical standards require a nonresponse bias analysis when the unit response rate for a sample is less than 85 percent.The nonresponse bias analysis of the household sample revealed differences in the background characteristics of respondents who participated in the assess-ment compared to those who refused. Detailed information about the nonresponse bias analysis is available on the NAAL website. A nonresponse bias adjust-ment was performed to reduce the bias due to respondent refusal.The adjustment corrected for the initial nonresponse bias, resulting in negligible bias for the household sample.The adjustment procedures are discussed in detail in the forthcoming 2003 NAAL Technical Report.The analy-ses presented in this report are based on data from the corrected household sample and the prison sample. 

# Population and Sample Size, and Data Collection Procedures 

Definitions of all population groups presented in this report are available on the NAAL web-site. Literacy results for adults who indicated they were American Indian/Alaska Native or Multiracial/Other are not reported separately but are included in the total population literacy estimates. 

Comparisons between 1992 and 2003 for multiracial adults are not possible because respondents were allowed to identify only one race in 1992. In 2003, about 2 per-cent of respondents identified multiple races. Due to small sam-ple sizes, the Multiracial and Other categories were combined. Results for Multiracial/Other and American Indian/Alaska Native adults, as well as results by Hispanic origin, will be included in future NAAL reports. All respondents were asked to report their birth dates, and this information was used to calcu-late their age. Age groups reported are 16 to 18, 19 to 24, 25 to 39, 40 to 49, 50 to 64, and 65 and older. Age groups were selected to correspond to the key life stages of many adults (though not all adults enter the stages at the ages specified): 

■ 16 to 18: Completion of secondary education 

■ 19 to 24: College or job training 

■ 25 to 39: Early career 

■ 40 to 49: Mid career 

■ 50 to 64: Late career 

■ 65 and older: Retirement

# Sample Assessment Questions 

Respondents who participated in the 2003 assessment were asked to complete prose, document, and quantitative literacy tasks of varying levels of difficulty. The sample questions on the following pages illustrate the types of tasks used to measure the literacy of America's adults. These questions were originally developed for the 1992 survey and were reused in 2003. Consistent with the design of the assessment, each sample question appears before the text or doc-ument needed to answer the question. The percentage of respondents who answered the question correctly is reported, as well as the percentage of correct responses for each of the four literacy assessment levels. More information about the sample assessment questions can be found on the Web at http://nces.ed.gov/naal. A First Look at the Literacy of America’s Adults in the 21 st Century
