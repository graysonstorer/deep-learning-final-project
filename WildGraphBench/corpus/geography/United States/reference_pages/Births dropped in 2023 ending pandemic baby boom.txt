Data:CDC;Chart: Axios Visuals

The total number of U.S. births dropped in 2023, bringing an end to a [mini-baby boom](https://www.axios.com/2022/10/19/remote-work-baby-boom-america) that began in the pandemic.

**Why it matters:**The drop in births helped plunge the U.S. fertility rate to its lowest point in nearly a century.

**The big picture:**Nearly 3.6 million babies were born in the U.S. last year, a 2% drop from 2022, according to [provisional data](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr035.pdf) from the Centers for Disease Control and Protection released Thursday.

*   The U.S. fertility rate in 2023 amounted to about 1.62 births per woman — well below the "replacement rate" of 2.1 that would allow a generation to completely replace itself.

**Zoom in:**Birth rates fell among adult women younger than 40 and were unchanged for women in their 40s, the data shows.

*   The birth rate among teens aged 15-19 dropped 3%.
*    Birth rates declined across nearly all racial groups.

**State of play:**The provisional data shows a return to a [broader downward trend](https://www.axios.com/2023/10/04/birth-rate-fertility-rate-decline-data-statistics-graph-2022) in the nation's birth rate.

*   The total number of births in the U.S. declined an average of 2% per year from 2015 to 2020, then rose slightly in 2021 — but has now fallen off again.

**Between the lines:**The drop in birth rates comes as many Americans have struggled to come to grips with the [impacts of inflation](https://www.axios.com/2024/03/29/inflation-prices-us-economy), [high food prices](https://www.axios.com/2024/01/13/food-prices-grocery-stores-us-economy), and [high rents](https://www.axios.com/2024/01/27/rent-unaffordable-housing-market-apartment-prices-cost).
