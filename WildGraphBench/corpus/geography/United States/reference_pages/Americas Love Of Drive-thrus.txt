**America's Love Of Drive-thrus : 1A****Drive-thrus are a quintessentially American phenomenon. The first was in the U.S. and they spread quickly nationwide in the mid-20th century due to the rise of car culture and the highway system.

Now, estimates suggest there are around 200,000 drive-thrus across the country. They grew in popularity during the pandemic. 

Drive-thrus have a history of innovation. Fast food companies are experimenting with new technology at their fast food windows, like AI chatbots or elevator food delivery systems that cut out human-to-human interaction.

Drive-thrus also offer more than just fast food. Drive-thru funeral homes, banks, and convenience stores save people the step of getting out of their cars.

We discuss the history and future of America's drive-thrus.

America boasts an estimated 200,000 drive-thrus nationwide.

 Tim Boyle/Getty Images 

Drive-thrus are a [quintessentially American phenomenon](https://www.history.com/news/drive-thru-dining-history-in-n-out-burger). The first was in the U.S. and they spread quickly nationwide in the mid-20th century due to the rise of car culture and the highway system.

Now, estimates suggest there are [around 200,000 drive-thrus](https://www.qreadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tenant-Spotlight-QSR-Drive-Thru-2.pdf) across the country. They [grew in popularity](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/07/dining/drive-through.html) during the pandemic. At White Castle, drive-thru orders accounted for about 70 percent of sales pre-lockdown. Now, they account for about 80 percent.

Drive-thrus have a history of innovation. The [first two-way speaker was invented by the founder of In-N-Out Burger](https://www.insider.com/in-n-out-burger-first-drive-thru-history). That trend continues to this day. Fast food companies [are experimenting](https://www.vox.com/food/23711010/fast-food-dining-delivery-automation) with new technology at their fast food windows, like [AI chatbots](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-10/del-taco-and-carl-s-jr-fast-food-restaurants-test-drive-thru-ai) or [elevator food delivery systems that cut out human-to-human interaction](https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/7/23158666/taco-bell-defy-digital-online-orders-drive-thru).

Drive-thrus also offer more than just fast food. [Drive-thru funeral homes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mq9My8BM4Qg), [banks](https://www.americanbanker.com/creditunions/news/banks-credit-unions-steer-back-to-drive-thrus), and [convenience stores](https://www.pymnts.com/news/loyalty-and-rewards-news/2023/convenience-stores-use-drive-thru-boost-loyalty/) save people the step of getting out of their cars.

How did America invent the drive-thru and why does it keep pulling up for more? We talk about the [climate](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/cities-put-brakes-on-drive-thrus-to-curb-carbon-emissions/#:~:text=But%20the%20ease%20of%20idling,carbon%20emissions%20that%20are%20released.), culture, tech, [health](https://www.eatthis.com/sonic-menu-best-worst/), [labor](https://nypost.com/2023/09/08/mcdonalds-workers-reveal-they-ignore-drive-thru-customers-who-do-this-one-thing/), [politics](https://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article278538174.html) and history stories behind the drive-thru window.
