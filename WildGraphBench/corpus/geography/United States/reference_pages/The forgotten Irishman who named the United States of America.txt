About Ad Settings

We and our 985 advertising partners process your personal data using technology such as cookies in order to serve advertising, analyse our traffic and deliver customised experiences for you. You have a choice in who uses your data and for what purposes.

Some partners do not ask for your consent to process your data, instead, they rely on their legitimate business interest. [View our list of partners](https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/The-forgotten-Irishman-who-named-the-United-States-of-America.html#) to see the purposes they believe they have legitimate interest for and how you can object to it.

The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed are saved in the local storage in 'cookiebotTcfConsentString', for a maximum of 13 months. After up to 13 months, the CMP will prompt again.

Purposes 14

You can set your consent preferences and determine how you want your data to be used based on the purposes below. Each purpose has a description so that you know how we and our partners use your data. You can object to legitimate interest processing per purpose.

Purposes 11[Reject all](https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/The-forgotten-Irishman-who-named-the-United-States-of-America.html#)[Accept all](https://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/The-forgotten-Irishman-who-named-the-United-States-of-America.html#)

- [x] Store and/or access information on a device 

Cookies, device or similar online identifiers (e.g. login-based identifiers, randomly assigned identifiers, network based identifiers) together with other information (e.g. browser type and information, language, screen size, supported technologies etc.) can be stored or read on your device to recognise it each time it connects to an app or to a website, for one or several of the purposes presented here.
Examples:*   Most purposes explained in this notice rely on the storage or accessing of information from your device when you use an app or visit a website. For example, a vendor or publisher might need to store a cookie on your device during your first visit on a website, to be able to recognise your device during your next visits (by accessing this cookie each time).

- [x] Use limited data to select advertising 

- [x] Legitimate Interest 

Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times an ad is presented to you).
Examples:*   A car manufacturer wants to promote its electric vehicles to environmentally conscious users living in the city after office hours. The advertising is presented on a page with related content (such as an article on climate change actions) after 6:30 p.m. to users whose non-precise location suggests that they are in an urban zone.
*   A large producer of watercolour paints wants to carry out an online advertising campaign for its latest watercolour range, diversifying its audience to reach as many amateur and professional artists as possible and avoiding showing the ad next to mismatched content (for instance, articles about how to paint your house). The number of times that the ad has been presented to you is detected and limited, to avoid presenting it too often.

Vendors 722

- [x] Create profiles for personalised advertising 

Information about your activity on this service (such as forms you submit, content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (for example, information from your previous activity on this service and other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (that might include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present advertising that appears more relevant based on your possible interests by this and other entities.
Examples:*   If you read several articles about the best bike accessories to buy, this information could be used to create a profile about your interest in bike accessories. Such a profile may be used or improved later on, on the same or a different website or app to present you with advertising for a particular bike accessory brand. If you also look at a configurator for a vehicle on a luxury car manufacturer website, this information could be combined with your interest in bikes to refine your profile and make an assumption that you are interested in luxury cycling gear.
*   An apparel company wishes to promote its new line of high-end baby clothes. It gets in touch with an agency that has a network of clients with high income customers (such as high-end supermarkets) and asks the agency to create profiles of young parents or couples who can be assumed to be wealthy and to have a new child, so that these can later be used to present advertising within partner apps based on those profiles.

Vendors 579

- [x] Use profiles to select personalised advertising 

Advertising presented to you on this service can be based on your advertising profiles, which can reflect your activity on this service or other websites or apps (like the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects.
Examples:*   An online retailer wants to advertise a limited sale on running shoes. It wants to target advertising to users who previously looked at running shoes on its mobile app. Tracking technologies might be used to recognise that you have previously used the mobile app to consult running shoes, in order to present you with the corresponding advertisement on the app.
*   A profile created for personalised advertising in relation to a person having searched for bike accessories on a website can be used to present the relevant advertisement for bike accessories on a mobile app of another organisation.

Vendors 584

- [x] Create profiles to personalise content 

Information about your activity on this service (for instance, forms you submit, non-advertising content you look at) can be stored and combined with other information about you (such as your previous activity on this service or other websites or apps) or similar users. This is then used to build or improve a profile about you (which might for example include possible interests and personal aspects). Your profile can be used (also later) to present content that appears more relevant based on your possible interests, such as by adapting the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find content that matches your interests.
Examples:*   You read several articles on how to build a treehouse on a social media platform. This information might be added to a profile to mark your interest in content related to outdoors as well as do-it-yourself guides (with the objective of allowing the personalisation of content, so that for example you are presented with more blog posts and articles on treehouses and wood cabins in the future).
*   You have viewed three videos on space exploration across different TV apps. An unrelated news platform with which you have had no contact builds a profile based on that viewing behaviour, marking space exploration as a topic of possible interest for other videos.

Vendors 257

- [x] Use profiles to select personalised content 

Content presented to you on this service can be based on your content personalisation profiles, which can reflect your activity on this or other services (for instance, the forms you submit, content you look at), possible interests and personal aspects. This can for example be used to adapt the order in which content is shown to you, so that it is even easier for you to find (non-advertising) content that matches your interests.
Examples:*   You read articles on vegetarian food on a social media platform and then use the cooking app of an unrelated company. The profile built about you on the social media platform will be used to present you vegetarian recipes on the welcome screen of the cooking app.
*   You have viewed three videos about rowing across different websites. An unrelated video sharing platform will recommend five other videos on rowing that may be of interest to you when you use your TV app, based on a profile built about you when you visited those different websites to watch online videos.

- [x] Measure advertising performance 

- [x] Legitimate Interest 

Information regarding which advertising is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine how well an advert has worked for you or other users and whether the goals of the advertising were reached. For instance, whether you saw an ad, whether you clicked on it, whether it led you to buy a product or visit a website, etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of advertising campaigns.
Examples:*   You have clicked on an advertisement about a “black Friday” discount by an online shop on the website of a publisher and purchased a product. Your click will be linked to this purchase. Your interaction and that of other users will be measured to know how many clicks on the ad led to a purchase.
*   You are one of very few to have clicked on an advertisement about an “international appreciation day” discount by an online gift shop within the app of a publisher. The publisher wants to have reports to understand how often a specific ad placement within the app, and notably the “international appreciation day” ad, has been viewed or clicked by you and other users, in order to help the publisher and its partners (such as agencies) optimise ad placements.

- [x] Measure content performance 

- [x] Legitimate Interest 

Information regarding which content is presented to you and how you interact with it can be used to determine whether the (non-advertising) content e.g. reached its intended audience and matched your interests. For instance, whether you read an article, watch a video, listen to a podcast or look at a product description, how long you spent on this service and the web pages you visit etc. This is very helpful to understand the relevance of (non-advertising) content that is shown to you.
Examples:*   You have read a blog post about hiking on a mobile app of a publisher and followed a link to a recommended and related post. Your interactions will be recorded as showing that the initial hiking post was useful to you and that it was successful in interesting you in the related post. This will be measured to know whether to produce more posts on hiking in the future and where to place them on the home screen of the mobile app.
*   You were presented a video on fashion trends, but you and several other users stopped watching after 30 seconds. This information is then used to evaluate the right length of future videos on fashion trends.

- [x] Understand audiences through statistics or combinations of data from different sources 

- [x] Legitimate Interest 

Reports can be generated based on the combination of data sets (like user profiles, statistics, market research, analytics data) regarding your interactions and those of other users with advertising or (non-advertising) content to identify common characteristics (for instance, to determine which target audiences are more receptive to an ad campaign or to certain contents).
Examples:*   The owner of an online bookstore wants commercial reporting showing the proportion of visitors who consulted and left its site without buying, or consulted and bought the last celebrity autobiography of the month, as well as the average age and the male/female distribution of each category. Data relating to your navigation on its site and to your personal characteristics is then used and combined with other such data to produce these statistics.
*   An advertiser wants to better understand the type of audience interacting with its adverts. It calls upon a research institute to compare the characteristics of users who interacted with the ad with typical attributes of users of similar platforms, across different devices. This comparison reveals to the advertiser that its ad audience is mainly accessing the adverts through mobile devices and is likely in the 45-60 age range.

Vendors 533

- [x] Develop and improve services 

- [x] Legitimate Interest 

Information about your activity on this service, such as your interaction with ads or content, can be very helpful to improve products and services and to build new products and services based on user interactions, the type of audience, etc. This specific purpose does not include the development or improvement of user profiles and identifiers.
Examples:*   A technology platform working with a social media provider notices a growth in mobile app users, and sees based on their profiles that many of them are connecting through mobile connections. It uses a new technology to deliver ads that are formatted for mobile devices and that are low-bandwidth, to improve their performance.
*   An advertiser is looking for a way to display ads on a new type of consumer device. It collects information regarding the way users interact with this new kind of device to determine whether it can build a new mechanism for displaying advertising on this type of device.

Vendors 621

- [x] Use limited data to select content 

- [x] Legitimate Interest 

Content presented to you on this service can be based on limited data, such as the website or app you are using, your non-precise location, your device type, or which content you are (or have been) interacting with (for example, to limit the number of times a video or an article is presented to you).
Examples:*   A travel magazine has published an article on its website about the new online courses proposed by a language school, to improve travelling experiences abroad. The school’s blog posts are inserted directly at the bottom of the page, and selected on the basis of your non-precise location (for instance, blog posts explaining the course curriculum for different languages than the language of the country you are situated in).
*   A sports news mobile app has started a new section of articles covering the most recent football games. Each article includes videos hosted by a separate streaming platform showcasing the highlights of each match. If you fast-forward a video, this information may be used to select a shorter video to play next.

Special Purposes 3

Ensure security, prevent and detect fraud, and fix errors 

Your data can be used to monitor for and prevent unusual and possibly fraudulent activity (for example, regarding advertising, ad clicks by bots), and ensure systems and processes work properly and securely. It can also be used to correct any problems you, the publisher or the advertiser may encounter in the delivery of content and ads and in your interaction with them.
Examples:*   An advertising intermediary delivers ads from various advertisers to its network of partnering websites. It notices a large increase in clicks on ads relating to one advertiser, and uses data regarding the source of the clicks to determine that 80% of the clicks come from bots rather than humans.

Deliver and present advertising and content 

Certain information (like an IP address or device capabilities) is used to ensure the technical compatibility of the content or advertising, and to facilitate the transmission of the content or ad to your device.
Examples:*   Clicking on a link in an article might normally send you to another page or part of the article. To achieve this, 1°) your browser sends a request to a server linked to the website, 2°) the server answers back (“here is the article you asked for”), using technical information automatically included in the request sent by your device, to properly display the information / images that are part of the article you asked for. Technically, such exchange of information is necessary to deliver the content that appears on your screen.

Save and communicate privacy choices 

The choices you make regarding the purposes and entities listed in this notice are saved and made available to those entities in the form of digital signals (such as a string of characters). This is necessary in order to enable both this service and those entities to respect such choices.
Examples:*   When you visit a website and are offered a choice between consenting to the use of profiles for personalised advertising or not consenting, the choice you make is saved and made available to advertising providers, so that advertising presented to you respects that choice.

The Cork man who 'named' the "United States of America"
=======================================================

**Have you ever wondered where the name “United States of America” came from?**

For years I never really thought about it, but it turns out that it was an [Irish Catholic](https://www.irishcentral.com/topic/catholic)from County Cork who deserves the credit for the name.

Odd when I think about it, but I had never once considered where the name “United States of America” came from. Oh sure, it's kind of obvious now – all these independent states, but somehow united too – but still, someone had to first coin the phrase before it could take root and eventually become the name of the new nation.

So when I saw this tweet from the NY Historical Society I was immediately hooked. “This,” I said to myself, “is a story I should know, but I don't.”

My only assumption, when I started to [read the article](https://www.nyhistory.org/blogs/coined-phrase-united-states-america-may-never-guess), was that it wasn't going to be Jefferson because his name so quickly popped into my head. So not Jefferson, but who?

According to the [NY Historical Society,](http://blog.nyhistory.org/coined-phrase-united-states-america-may-never-guess/) Stephen Moylan was the man responsible for the earliest documented use of the phrase “United States of America.” But who was Stephen Moylan?

Moylan was an Irishman and a Catholic. He was from Cork, born in 1737 and the son of a merchant. His mother's family were also merchants and both families were “among the [most prosperous Catholic families](http://www.pmoylan.org/pages/family/kenmoylan/Stephen_Moylan.html) in Cork.“

The Moylans were well-to-do, but because they were Catholic, in order for Stephen to be educated he had to be smuggled out of Ireland to France because education was forbidden to Catholics under the penal laws imposed on Ireland at the time.

That was an experience that probably didn't engender a deep love for the British in him. So Stephen was educated in France and later went to work for the family business in Lisbon before moving on to Philadelphia in 1768.

Shortly after the Revolutionary War began in the spring of 1775, Moylan offered his services to George Washington, who took him on and made Moylan his Muster-Master General. Moylan's role was to bring order to the chaos of the assembled, but not so united, units of the “United Armies of the Colonies” around Boston.

Moylan's success in that role earned him more roles under Washington and during the war, he was Secretary and Aide-de-camp, Quartermaster-General, and then Colonel of the 4th Pennsylvania Light Dragoons. “Stephen Moylan had about as wide an experience in Revolutionary War actions as can be imagined.” From [Boston](https://www.irishcentral.com/topic/boston) to Yorktown, he was as involved as one man could have been.

So Moylan was an impressive member of the founders' generation, but he is relatively unknown. Maybe that will change now.

For years, the presumption was that the phrase “United States of America” first arose around the time that the members of the Continental Congress were meeting in Philadelphia in the run-up to the issuing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776.

Most of the research into the origins of the nation's name focused on that period. That's when the leaders of the colonies were beginning to think in grander terms than 'No taxation without representation.' They imagined a new nation, independent of Britain and, therefore, they probably tossed around phrases that would have described what they were imagining.

The phrase “United States of America” was, of course, used in the Declaration of Independence so Jefferson must have been using it in drafts before that. However, other delegates to the Continental Congress are known to have used the phrase at that time.

Yet, none of them – as far as current research shows – had used the phrase before [April 1776](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/48693538), when it was used in an anonymous essay published in the Virginia Gazette. That usage was discovered by Byron DeLear a couple of years ago, but later on he announced he had found an even earlier reference to the “United States of America” in a letter from Stephen Moylan to Joseph Reed.

Reed was a colonel in the Continental Army and George Washington's secretary. In January 1776 Reed was on leave in Philadelphia when Moylan, who was filling in for Reed, wrote to him and said that he wanted to go to Spain on a mission to seek help for the fight against Britain “with full and ample powers from the United States of America.”

There it is, the earliest documented use of the phrase “United States of America,” in a letter written by Stephen Moylan.

Moylan and Reed lived with Washington in Cambridge so any of those three may have first uttered the phrase among themselves. We can never be sure.

Yet, Moylan was an “outspoken advocate of independence,” a “hothead for independence,” according to the New York Historical Society's article. The very act of putting such a sentiment on paper was a bold step.

Even those among the leaders who may have thought such thoughts or even spoken them aloud were not yet ready to put such treasonous ideas on paper. Moylan did because he was that keen on ending the relationship with Britain, which was may have been due to his experiences in Ireland as much as those in America.

He was, in the modern parlance, an 'early adopter' of the view that there would be no resolution with Britain short of full independence and by writing that letter he put his head on the chopping block if it had all gone wrong. For that reason alone, barring any future finds of earlier references, Moylan deserves the credit for the name “United States of America."

Moylan was an Irish Catholic, an American patriot, and the man, for now anyway, who can be credited with coining the phrase “the United States of America.” Yet I'd never heard of him.* Now I have and I can say this: the Irish didn't just build America, they named it too.
