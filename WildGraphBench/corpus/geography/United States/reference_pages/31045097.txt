Urban mass transportation planning
==================================

Author: [Alan Black](https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=au=%22Black%2C%20Alan%22)

Summary: This book provides the perfect comprehensive introduction to mass transit for anyone interested in transportation planning as a career, as well as for those who simply have a personal interest in the subject area. It is a policy-oriented book that contains some technical material, but avoids in-depth coverage of the electric and mechanical engineering aspects. Distinctly factual, and not ideological, the book offers readers a balanced view of the debate between highways and transit - carefully presenting both sides of controversial issues. The intent is to give readers the solid understanding necessary to analyze problems objectively, and to assure that transit proposals are rationally planned and evaluated
