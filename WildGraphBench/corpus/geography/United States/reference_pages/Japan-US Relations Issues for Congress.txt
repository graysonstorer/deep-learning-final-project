RL33436 Japan -U.S. Relations: Issues for Congress 

> Congressional Research Service

# Summary 

Japan is a significant partner of the United States in a number of foreign policy areas, including 

addressing regional security concerns, which range from hedging against Chinese military 

modernization to countering threats from North Korea. The U.S. -Japan military alliance, formed 

in 1952, grants the U.S. military the right to base U.S. troops —currently around 54,000 strong —

and other military assets on Japanese ter ritory, undergirding the “forward deployment ” of U.S. 

troops in East Asia. In return, the United States pledges to help defend Japan. The two countries 

collaborate through multiple bilateral and multilateral institutions on issues such as science and 

techn ology, global health, energy, and agriculture. 

In the past several years , congressional interest in U.S. relations with Japan has centered on the 

strength of the U.S. -Japan alliance and particularly on how the governments of Japan and the 

United States co ordinate their China strategies. In the 11 8th Congress, legislation has the potential 

to re -shape U.S. policy with Taiwan, which in turn has the potential to create a policy gap 

between the United States and Japan. In the event of a military contingency th at engages the 

United States, U.S. bases in Japan wou ld almost certainly be heavily involved. Another element 

of congressional activity on Japan is the encouragement of greater coordination among U.S. allies 

in the Indo -Pacific and particularly in the ofte n-troubled relationship between Japan and South 

Korea . Congressional engagement with Japan has grown in the past decade, evident in frequent 

travel to the country and the interest in the bipartisan U.S. -Japan Congressional Caucus with over 

100 Members. 

Un der the President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Fumio Kishida Administrations, the two 

countries have reaffirmed the U.S. -Japan alliance as a centerpiece of their respective Indo -Pacific 

strategies. Biden has emphasized rejuvenating bilateral alliances to d eal with issues like North 

Korean denuclearization as well as China ’s maritime assertiveness, human rights violations, and 

attempts to set new economic rules and norms through its growing outward investment. Both 

capitals view China ’s policies and practice s as a threat to stability in the region, and have 

coordinated policies on initiatives like the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue —known as the 

“Quad. ” In the wake of Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine, Japan imposed harsh sanction s and other 

financial restrictions on Russia. Japanese leaders are increasingly public about their concern with 

Taiwan ’s security as linked to Japan ’s own security and have moved to substantially increase 

their defense spending to respond to the changing st rategic landscape .

Over the past decade, U.S. -Japan defense cooperation has improved and evolved in response to 

security challenges, such as the North Korean missile threat and the confrontation between Japan 

and China over disputed islands. Despite these advances, Japan ’s government has indicated a goal 

of develop ing a more autonomous defense posture that is less reliant on U.S. protection. As Japan 

ramps up defense spending, Japanese policymakers are weighing to what extent they should 

devote resources t o indigenous development or rather to focus on initiatives that deepen U.S. -

Japan joint capabilities. 

In the aftermath of the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in July 2022 , Japanese 

politics remain dominated by the Liberal Democratic Part y (LDP) and its smaller coalition 

partner Komeito. According to public opinion polls, Kishida ’s political standing is weak due to 

dissatisfaction with his government ’s handling of inflation, a weak yen, and a scandal involving 

the Unification Church and fe llow LDP members. Despite this lack of popularity, Kishida appears 

poised to remain in his position at least through next year given the weak opposition and in ternal 

problems within the LDP. Japan is to host the 2023 G -7 in Hiroshima, Kishida ’s hometown. Japan -U.S. Relations: Issues for Congress

Japan is the United States ’ fourth -largest overall trading partner and Japanese firms are the 

second -largest source of foreign direct investment in the United States. Tensions in the trade 

relationship increased under the Trump Administration , particularly over its efforts to reduce the 

bilateral U.S. trade deficit, such as in motor vehicles, which account for roughly one -third of 

Japan ’s annual exports to the United States. A limited bilateral trade agreement went into effect in 

January 2020 that i ncludes some tariff cuts and digital trade commitments by both sides. Japan is 

likely to be an important partner in the U.S. -led Indo -Pacific Economic Framework for 

Prosperity, although Japanese leaders have expressed disappointment that the United States has 

not indicated it will seek to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans -Pacific Partnership 

regional trade pact , previously known as the Trans -Pacific Partnership. Japan -U.S. Relations: Issues for Congress

his report contains two main parts: a section describing recent events and a longer 

background section on key elements of the U.S. -Japan relationship. 

# Developments in 2022 

# U.S. -Japan Strategy Aligns, w it h Converging Views on China and 

# Russia 

In 2022, the U.S. -Japan relationship continue d to expand, build ing on early indications by the 

Biden Administration and its Japanese counterparts that the U.S. -Japan alliance is a centerpiece of 

the two countries ’ Indo -Pacific strategies. Tokyo ’s and Washington ’s strategic priorities appear 

increasingly aligned in responding to China ’s rising military and economic power . Beyond the 

region, the two countries are workin g in tandem to respond to global challenges , including at the 

United Nations, where Japan will occupy a non -permanent seat on the Security Council in 2023 

and 2024 . Multiple high -level visits, including by President Biden in May 20 22, have reinforced 

the t ight bilateral ties. 

Japan ’s reaction to Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine is emblematic of this trend toward alignment .

Japan ’s sanctions against Russia for its annexation of Crimea in 2014 were arguably milder than 

those adopted by its Group of 7 (G -7) partn ers, a response that analysts attribute to Japan ’s

pursuit of energy cooperation with Russia and then -Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ’s drive to forge a 

strategic partnership with Russia. 1 In contrast, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida ’s government 

responded to Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine with alacrity, arguing that Russia ’s war on Ukraine has 

implications for Japan ’s security because of the war ’s potential to usher in an international system 

where the “rule of force ” replaces the “rule of law. ”2 Japan has adopted most of the sanctions and 

other penalties against Russia employed by the United States and Europe, provided humanitarian 

and material support for Ukraine despite Russia ’s threats to cu rtail energy supplies, and worked 

to rally international support for Ukraine. 3 Japan ’s membership in the G -7 has provided a venue 

for coordination with the United States and major European countries. Japan holds the presidency 

of the G -7 in 2023 and plans to host the leaders ’ summit in May 2023 in Kishida ’s hometown of 

Hiroshima. 

Congr ess has debated expanding ties with Taiwan through legislation and, together with the 

executive branch, is focused on possible threat s to the island from the People ’s Republic of China 

(China, or PRC) . Japan ’s government shares the concern that China may attempt to take military 

action against Taiwan in the coming years . After then -Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi visited 

Taiwan in August 2022 , China ’s military, the People ’s L iberation Army (PLA) , launched 

unprecedented large -scale military exercises near Taiwan .4 During one phase of the exercises,

several short -range ball istic missiles China test -launched splashed down in Japan ’s exclusive 

economic zone . China ’s actions appeared to underscore for many Japanese the impression that 

Taiwan ’s security is linked to Japan ’s security. 5 In response to China ’s actions , U.S. Secretary of 

Defense Lloyd Austin and his Japanese counterpart , Yasukazu Hamada , met in September 2022 

and condemned China ’s “coercive actions, ” calling them “provocative, destabilizing and 

unprecedented .” 6

# Japan Expands Its Defense Posture 

As perceived threats from North Korea and China have grown more acute, Japan ’s government 

has reconsidered national security. With the LDP and its smaller coalition party Komeito in firm 

control of the Diet (Japan ’s parliament) , Kishida theoretically has the power to loosen some of 

Japan ’s long -held restrictions on its military posture, particularly if he gains Komeito ’s support 

for these changes. (For background on the restrictions on Japan ’s offensive capabilities, see 

“Collective Self Defense ” below .) After seeing the aggression of Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine —

and possibly fearing that Chinese President Xi Jinping cou ld attempt a similar attack on Taiwan —

over half of the Japanese public appeared to shift in favor of spending more on Japan ’s defense. 7

The U.S. government has long supported Japan investing more in its defense and reinforcing 

deterrence against Chinese th reats. 8

In addition , Japan has expanded its security cooperation with other countries, with the 

encouragement of the U.S. government. In early 2022, Japan concluded a Reciprocal Access 

Agreement with Australia, allowing the Australian military and the Japa nese Self -Defense Forces 

(SDF) to conduct joint defense and humanitarian operations. In May, a similar agreement was 

signed with the United Kingdom, further expanding Japan ’s network of formal defense 

relationships. Japan has also continued outreach with I ndia ’s military forces to encompass 

defense technology and equipment cooperation as well as regular naval exercises to improve 

interoperability. 9 Although these relationships are not as developed or formalized as the treaty 

alliance with the United States, these burgeoning arrangements indicate efforts by Japan to 

diversify its defense partnerships and —potentially —lessen its dependence on the United States 

for its security. 

# Japan ’s Transformational Defense Documents 

On December 16, 2022, the government of J apan released a trio of much -anticipated security 

documents: the National Security Strategy (NSS), the National Defense Strategy, and the Defense 

Buildup Program. Taken together, these documents provide a blueprint that could fundamentally

reshape Japan ’s approach to defending itself and to its security relationship with the United 

States. The NSS describes China as an “unprecedented strategic challenge, ” a tougher 

characterization than the 2013 iteration of the NSS, which called China “an issue of concern to 

the international community. ”10 A t op U.S. official hailed the documents as “bold and historic ”11 

and praised Tokyo ’s pledged investments that would enhance deterrence in the region. A 

spokesperson for China ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented on Japa n’s security documents, 

saying: “Hyping up the ‘China threat ’ to find an excuse for its military build -up is doomed to 

fail. ”12 

Japan ’s determination to develop a “counter -strike ” capability is arguably among the most 

consequential of the policies unveiled in the documents. This capability would allow Japan to 

conduct missile strikes against missile -related sites within an adversary ’s territory under certain 

conditions. Japan currently does not possess the missiles necessary to carry out such strikes and 

th erefore relies on U.S. strike capabilities or its ballistic missile defense system to deter or defeat 

adversary strikes. Due to Japan ’s constitutional limitation of acting only in self -defense, the 

government has stipulated that Japanese forces are not per mitted to conducts pre -emptive attacks, 

though it has left vague what it defines as pre -emptive. Press reports indicate that Japan is 

considering acquiring the U.S. -made Tomahawk cruise missile as well as upgrading its own 

missiles to achieve this goal. 13 

Japan ’s Defense Buildup Program outlines plans to increase Japan ’s defense expenditures to 2% 

of its national gross domestic product (GDP) , in line with NATO standards , by the latter part of 

the decade . Post -war Japan has generally limited def ense spending to 1% of its GDP. If this 

increase were to take effect , Japan ’s defense budget would become the third -largest in the world 

after the United States and China. Questions remain about how Japan will reach this threshold, 

which may involve counting the Coast Guard and other costs not currently considered part of the 

defense budget as defense expenditures . Whether or not Japan ’s government meets the 2% goal ,

the country is poised to devote considerably more of its national budget to defense in a significant 

dep arture from its previous post -war practices. 

These documents frame a number of strategic challenges facing Japan, and Japanese 

policymakers face a phalanx of decisions about how to address them . To increase the defense 

budget , the Japanese government must decide whether to raise taxes, cut other government 

spending, and/or go further into debt .14 Will public sentiment supporting Japan ’s more assertive 

security posture remain durable? Does Japan purchase U.S. military hardware or invest more 

heavily in its do mestic industry? Defense experts question whether Japan ’s defense industry can 

produce cutting -edge technology yet caution that Japan may need to upgrade its information 

security in order to receive U.S. weapons systems. 15 Key to all of these considerations is the

extent to which Japan seeks to develop more self -sufficiency while simultaneously keeping the 

U.S. alliance strong. 

# Kishida ’s Public Approval Sinks after Abe Assassination 

In the summer and early fall of 2022, Japan ’s political situation continued to be colored by the 

after -effects of the July 2022 assassination of former Prime Minister Abe. Abe, 67 at the time of 

his murder, was postwar Japan ’s longest serving prime minister and arguably continued to be 

Japan ’s most powerful politician. Since Abe ’s death, Kishida ’s public approval ratings have fallen 

significantly, dipping below his disapproval ratings for the first time since he assumed the 

premiership in October 2021. 16 If this trend continues, it could destabilize Japanese politics and 

compli cate Kishida ’s ability to wield influence within his LDP and with its smaller coalition 

partner, the Komeito party. Kishida may then have less political clout, willingness, and/or time to 

push through Japan ’s Diet the controversial policies on his agenda, such as significantly 

expanding Japan ’s defense spending, backing a return to more full -scale use of nuclear power, 

and implementing his “new capitalism ” economic agenda. 17 Kishida ’s term as LDP president runs 

until 2024 , and parliamentary elections do not need to be held until 2025, potentially giving him 

time to recover his political standing. 

Pollsters and political analysts identify three principal causes for Kishida ’s difficulties: discontent 

with the government ’s response to rising prices , significant public opposition to the government 

holding and financing a state funeral for Abe , and his response to revelations in the wake of Abe ’s

assassination of the extent of the LDP ’s ties to the Unification Church (see the text box below) .18 

In an apparent effor t to remove political appointees with the closest links to the church, Kishida 

reshuffled his cabinet in August. However, evidence subsequently surfaced that many of the 

newly appointed cabinet ministers and vice -ministers had ties to the church, and an in ternal LDP 

survey revealed that nearly half the LDP ’s Diet members have had dealings with the church , such 

as receiving political donations or attending church functions. 19 In a four -week period in the fall 

of 2022, three members of Kishida ’s new cabinet re signed due to a variety of scandals.

# A Thaw in Japan -South Korea Tensions 

Japan –South Korea relations are perennially fraught because of a territorial dispute and sensitive 

historical issues stemming from Japan ’s colonization of the Korean Peninsula from 1910 to 1945. 

Beginning in 2018, a series of actions and retaliatory countermeasures by both governments 

involving trade, security, and history -related controversies caused South Korea –Japan relations to 

plummet, eroding U.S. –South Korea –Japan policy coordination. Relations have shown signs of 

improvement since the conservative Yoon Suk -yeol beca me president of South Korea in May 

2022. Yoon , who has said he is seeking to increase alignment with the United States on many 

Indo -Pacific policies, has placed a priority on improving relations with Japan. With 

encouragement from the Biden Administration, Tokyo and Seoul have taken a number of steps to 

restore a positive relationship, including holding three trilateral heads -of -state meetings (the first 

since 2017 ) in 2022 in June, September, and November . Following North Korea ’s flurry of 

missile tests in 2022, the United States, Japan, and South Korea have resumed public t rilateral 

military exercises, including a first -ever trilateral bal listic missile defense naval exercise in 

October 2022. In their November summit, Biden, Kishida, and Yoon issued a joint statement 

declaring their intent to “share DPRK missile warning data in real time .” 23 

While relations appear to be improving, it is unclear how the two governments might resolve the 

thorniest historical issues in order to deepen trust and whether Jap an ’s leaders will reciprocate the 

efforts being made by the Yoon government . (See Japan –South Korea Relations section below for 

more details.) Since the mid -2010s, many public opinion polls have shown that over 40% of 

Japanese respondents and over half of South Korean respondents have poor impressions of the 

other country, though these negative ratings appear to have fallen between 2021 and 2022. 24 

Making concessions to South Korea is reportedly particularly unpopular among many LDP 

conservatives, constraini ng Kishida ’s options. 25 

# Economic Recovery from COVID -19 

Relative to other developed economies, Japan has lagged behind in its economic recovery from 

the COVID -19 pandemic. 26 Japan ’s GDP increased in 2021 by 1.7% after decreasing by 4.5% in 

2020, but the eco nomy contracted in the third quarter of 2022 , raising some concerns over

sustained recovery. 27 The government remains focused on economic recovery and is providing 

continued fiscal and monetary support. In late October 2022, the Kishida government announced 

a new package of economic measures worth ¥39 trillion ($264 billion) , building on past stimulus 

for economic relief from rising food and energy prices in the fallout from Russia ’s invasion of 

Ukraine. 28 The Bank of Japan (BoJ) , unlike other central banks, remains committed to 

maintaining a loose monetary policy, taking actions to prevent interest rate increases. Ultra -low 

interest rates —the BoJ ’s policy rate is set at minus 0.1% —have placed downward pressure on the 

yen, which fell to a historic low against the U.S. dollar in October 2022. 29 Japanese officials have 

historically lauded a weak yen (which makes Japan ’s exports cheaper and imports more 

expensive), but the effect on import costs is also of increasing concern to many observers given 

the already high costs of imported energy and other commodities and Japan ’s recent economic 

contraction. 30 The weak yen, which boosts spending power of foreigners, supports Kishida ’s

pledge to revive Japan ’s tourism industry, with a goal of increasin g foreign tourists ’ total 

spending to more than 5 trillion yen ($35 billion) annually .31 To this end, on October 11, 2022, the 

Japanese government ended pandemic -related visa and other border restrictions on international 

travelers . S ome critics had describ ed these measures as overly strict. 32 Despite some signs of 

recovery since 2020 , experts suggest the Japanese economy faces major headwinds in the near 

term due to a resurgence in COVID -19 cases , rising cost s of import ed goods , and the economic 

slowdo wn in the United States and other trading partners. 33 

# U.S. -Japan Renew al of Regional Economic Engagement 

In May 2022, Japan joined 13 other countries as an inaugural negotiating partner in the U.S. -led 

Indo -Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) initiat ive. IPEF appears to be the Biden 

Administration ’s response to urging —from policymakers, stakeholders, and U.S. allies such as 

Japan —for the United States to advance a trade agenda in what many consider the world ’s most 

dynamic economic region. 34 IPEF will not take the form of a traditional comprehensive U.S. Free 

Trade Agreement ( FTA ) but instead is focused on four sepa rate “pillars ” covering trade, supply 

chains, infrastructure and decarbonization, and tax and anti -corruption. At their ministerial in 

Septe mber 2022, IPEF members announced the negotiating objectives for each pillar . Japan and 

most countries ( all except for India) opted to participate in all four pillars .35 Unlike typical U.S.

FTAs, IPEF will not cover tariffs and some other market access provisions. Japan and other IPEF 

partner countries have generally welcomed renewed U.S. engagement via the framework but also 

voiced various concerns and hopes for the agreement. 36 

Many observers argue that since President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the 

proposed Trans -Pacific Partnership (TPP) in 2017, the United States has failed to present a robust 

alternative economic strategy in the region. 37 Some Members of Congress and other stakeholders 

have expressed support for IPEF as an opportuni ty for the United States to take a leading role in 

establishing updated trade and economic rules in partnership with Japan and key partners in the 

region. At the same time, others have raised concerns over the initiative ’s potential lack of 

substantive com mitments, including on market access, the binding nature (or lack thereof ) of any 

commitments reached, and overall ambition to effectively deepen economic linkages. 38 The Biden 

Administration has suggested IPEF is to take the form of executive agreements, p recluding a role 

for Congress in approving the future agreements. 39 Some Members have raised concerns over this 

approach and the perceived lack of consultation with Congress , emphasizing the need for a 

greater congressional role. 40 The leaders of Japan and s ome trading partners have urged the Biden 

Administration to consider joining the 11 -nation Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for 

Trans -Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), which Japan helped form after U.S. withdrawal from the TPP. 

Previously, the Trump and Abe Administrations negotiated two limited bilateral trade deals, 

which took effect in 2020, liberalizing some agricultural and industrial goods trade and 

establishing rules on digital trade. 

# Congressional Role in U.S. -Japan Relations 

Prior to the late 20 10s, congressional engagement on Japan tended to focus on trade -related 

issues, concerns about the pace of base realignment on Okinawa, and Japan ’s treatment of 

history -related disputes with South Korea. (See “Comfort Women Issue ” section below.) As 

China ’s rise re -shaped security outlooks, Congress focused more on the strength of U.S. defense 

partnerships in the Indo -Pacific as part of its oversight responsibility . In 2014, the bipartisan U.S. -

Japan Congressional Caucus was formed, with over 100 Members jo ining the group. In 2015, 

Congress invited then -Prime Minister Abe to address a joint meeting of Congress —the first time 

a Japanese leader did so —and Abe outlined a more forceful role for Japan in the alliance. After 

Abe was assassinated in 2022, both cham bers of Congress passed resolutions honoring his 

commitment to the alliance and praising his vision for a free and open Indo -Pacific. 

When Congress grew concerned about the state of U.S. alliances in Asia under the Trump 

Administration —specifically with J apan and South Korea —it passed the Asia Reassurance 

Initiative Act ( P.L. 115 -409 ) in late 2018 . The law assert ed congressional prerogatives, authorize d

more spending, and direct ed the executive branch to develop a more strategic and long -term 

strategy in Asia. The act provides a n example of how Congress conducts oversight of U.S. foreign 

policy. 

More recently, congressional interest in U.S. relations with Japan has centered on the strength of 

the U.S. -Japan alliance and particularly on how Japan and the United States coordinate their 

China strategies. Members ’ concern about China ’s ability to forcefully seize Taiwan has led to the 

introduction of legislation that has the pot ential to re -shape U.S. policy with Taiwan, which in 

turn could create a policy gap between the United States and Japan . Japan has not committed to 

help Taiwan defend itself. (See “The Role of Taiwan ” section below.) In the event of a military 

contingency that engages the United States, U.S. bases in Japan would likely be involved , and 

Japan could become a target for Chinese strikes. Congress may consider consulting with Japanese 

interlocutors as they chart a course for U.S. legislation relating to Taiwan. 

Congressional interest in U.S. security policy in the Indo -Pacific has also led some Members to 

encourage greater coordination among U.S. allies in the region. In the past, Congress ha d passed 

resolutions that encourage greater trilateral cooperation among the United States, South Korea, 

and Japan, underscoring the value of the two allies working together. 41 During official travel and 

other engagement with Japanese and South Korean officials, some Members have emphasized 

this importance to Japanese and South Korean officials . Some Members have engaged in trilateral 

legislative exchanges, which could be expanded in order to encourage more coordination. 

Annual authorization and appropriations bills —including the National Defense Authorization Act 

(NDAA), State Department -Foreign Operations Appropriations bills, Military Construction -

Veterans Affairs (VA) Appropriations bills, and any hearings surrounding these measures —

provide opportunities for congressional involvement in and oversight of U.S. -Japan relations, 

particularly on issues related to the U.S. -Japan alliance. The FY2023 NDAA ( P.L. 117 -263 , as 

amended) , for example, included a sense of Congress provision (§1265) stating that the United 

States should “further the comparative advantage of the United States in strategic competition ”

with China in part by “enhancing cooperation with Japan … including by developing advanced 

military capabilities, fostering interoperability acr oss all domains, and improving sharing of 

information and intelligence. ”

# Overview of U.S. -Japan Relations 

Forged in the wake of Japan ’s defeat in World War II, the U.S. -Japan relationship has transformed 

dramatically , with the two former adversaries becoming close allies over the course of seven 

decades. After the United States occupied the archipelago from 1945 to 19 52, the U.S. Senate 

ratified the Treaty of Peace with Japan in March 1952. 42 As the confrontation with the Soviet 

Union developed, the Un ited States increasingly came to view Japan as a strategic bulwark in the 

Pacific. In the post –Cold War period, the relationship endured as Japan embraced international 

institutions and practices promoted by the United States. As North Korean threats emerg ed and

China rose economically and militarily, both countries found an imperative to maintain and 

modernize the bilateral alliance. 

The U.S. -Japan relationship is broad and deep -seated. Globally, the two countries cooperate on 

scores of non -traditional se curity issues through multilateral fora and international institutions, 

from nuclear nonproliferation to global health to disaster relief to climate change. The U.S. -Japan 

relationship has enjoy ed broad support from Congress 43 as well as strong public suppo rt among 

both populations, according to opinion polls. 44 As challenges to the international rules -based 

order have developed, Japan and the United States have made efforts to strengthen their military 

cooperation. Under the Japanese constitution —drafted by U.S. officials during the American 

occupation —Japan has limitations on its ability to expand its military capability. 45 As threat 

perceptions have intensified, however, Japan has made significant changes to how it interprets 

legal constraints. U.S. and Japanese defense officials say that the two allies are worki ng more 

closely together than ever before. 46 

Despite these strengths, difficult issues remain. The challenges and threats from China and North 

Korea have grown sharper over the past several years : North Korea has accelerated its nuclear 

weapon and missile capabilities dramatically since 2016 , and China ’s economic strength and 

military capabilities have grown significantly in the past decade . Japanese leaders expressed 

dismay when the United States withdrew from the TPP in 2017. Trump ’s apparent skepticism of 

the value of the alliance with Japan may have exacerbated the Japanese defense establishment ’s

long -standing fears of U.S. abandonment. Many analysts in Japan have indicated worry that U.S. 

commitment to the alliance could be impermanent, dependent on who is elected to the U.S. 

presidency. 47 In addition, Japanese concerns about what Joseph Nye calls the “relative decline ” of 

U.S. power and presence in the region have risen. 48 In the United States, v oices have emerged 

calling on Japan to contribute more resou rces to its own defense. 49 

# Biden Administration Policy 

The Biden Administration has sought to elevate the U.S. -Japan alliance as a centerpiece of the 

U.S. strategy in the Indo -Pacific and embraced an approach to the region that dovetails well with 

Japan ’s vision. Biden has emphasized the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue —known as the

Article 9 of the Japanese constitution outlaws war as a “sovereign right” of Japan and stipulates that “land, sea, and 

air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained.” The constituti on has never been amended. Any 

attempt to change the constitution would require formidable political and procedural hurdles. A constitutional revision 

requires a two -thirds vote in each Diet chamber followed by approval in a nationwide referendum. Furtherm ore, any 

constitutional changes passed by the Diet must also be approved by a majority in a nationwide referendum, and many 

opinion polls show the Japanese public to be skeptical about the need for a revision, particularly of Article 9.

“Quad ”—with Japan, India , and Australia. Biden, like Trump before him, has affirmed that 

Article 5 of the mutual defense treaty applies to the S enkaku Islands, a territory claimed by both 

Japan and China . The Biden Administration included this pledge in its National Security 

Strategy .50 In December 2021, the two governments anno unced a new five -year cost -sharing 

agreement that raised Japanese contr ibutions by around 7% to defray the costs of the U.S. 

military presence in Japan. During the Trump Administration, as the previous agreement 

approached its expiration, the United States reportedly requested that Japan pay $8 billion 

annually, compared to t he roughly $2.5 billion it now pays. 51 By concluding an agreement that 

continued Japan ’s approximate contribution from years past , the Biden Administration appeared 

to signal its support of long -standing U.S. alliances. 

# U.S. and Japanese Policy on China 

Le aders of Japan and the United States share a fundamental and profound concern about China ’s

role in the Indo -Pacific. Both governments have expressed distrust of Beijing ’s intentions and 

indicated that they see China ’s rising power and influence as detrime ntal to their national 

security. This shared strategic vision tethers the two countries and propels closer cooperation. 

Japan ’s proximity to China heightens its concern, particularly because of China ’s expansive 

maritime claims and regular military activit ies near Japan ’s southwestern islands . Apparently 

driven by its apprehension, Japan has developed stronger and more integrated defense relations 

with Australia and India —als o U.S. partners —that facilitate military enga gement through the 

Quad and other coop erative activities such as the annual Malabar naval exercises among the four 

countries . These multilateral efforts, which the Obama , Trump , and Biden Administrations 

encouraged, reinforce U.S. -Japan alliance cohesion and cement the focus on pushing back on 

China ’s increas ed power. 

Differences remain, however, in how the U.S. and Japanese governments re spond to threats posed 

by China . Most fundamentally, Japan and China are uniquely bound by their proximity, requiring 

the Japanese government to manage relat ions with its larger and more powerful neighbor in ways 

the United States need not. Japa nese leaders have asserted that they seek to stabilize Japan ’s

relationship with China as an important trading partner .52 Before the disruption of the pandemic, 

the Japa nese government was preparing to welcome Chinese President Xi for an official state 

visit in the spring of 2020 , an example of Japan ’s outreach to China before relations soured in the 

subsequent years .

The Role of Tai wan 

Since 1972, Japan has had “unofficial ” relations with Taiwan, the democratic and self -governed 

island east of mainland China over which the PRC claims sovereignty. 53 As with the United 

States, the lack of formal ties belies the depth and breadth of the Japan -Taiwan relationship . Th e

two countries are each other ’s third -largest trading partner s.54 People -to -people ties are robust :

Taiwan is a top tourism destination for Japanese visitors, and vice versa . T he two sides maintain 

de facto embassies (the Ta ipei Economic and Cultural Repre sentative Office in Japan, in Tokyo, 

and the Japan -Taiwan Exchange Association, in Taipei) and have found creative ways to conduct 

quasi -diplomacy, including through their respective ruling parties and g roups such as the Japan -

ROC Diet Members ’ Consultativ e C ouncil .55 In 2013, Taiwan and Japan concluded a n agreement 

governing reciprocal fishing rights in disputed areas of the East China Sea and have explored 

possible future cooperation between their coast guards. Unlike those of the United States, Japan ’s

un official ties with Taiwan do not extend to military cooperation. 56 

Japan ’s 2021 defense white paper stated that “stabilizing the situation surrounding Taiwan is 

important … for Japan ’s security ” and that “it is necessary that we pay close attention to the 

[cross -Strait] situation with a sense of crisis more than ever before. ”57 Some observers caution 

that if China were to occupy Taiwan, it could project power deeper into the Western Pacific and 

more easily coerce Japan and other U.S. allies in the region. 58 Particularly since 2020, some 

Japanese politicians have drawn links between Taiwan ’s security and that of Japan. Former Prime 

Minister Abe cultivated closer ties with Taiwan throughout his career and , after stepping down in 

2020 , took an even more explicitl y pro -Taiwan position, arguing that the United States should 

abandon its long -standing policy of “strategic ambiguity ” and “make clear that it will defend 

Taiwan against any attempted Chinese invasion. ”59 

A cross -Strait military conflict —particularly if it involved the United States —would carry a range 

of implications for Japan . Beyond massive long -term economic and geopolitical ramifications, 

PRC operations against Taiwan would likely involve military combat operations close to Japan ’s

southwest island cha in . A PRC blockade of Taiwan could affect Japan ’s trade and sea lines of 

communication. The PRC could also launch strikes against U.S. (and/or Japanese) bases in Japan 

in an effort to cripple the U.S. military ’s ability to come to Taiwan ’s aid. 

Should the United States come to Taiwan ’s defense in the event of a PRC attack, some experts 

argue that the U.S. military ’s prompt and effective response would hinge on access to U.S. troops, 

weapons systems, and materiel based in Japan, particularly in Okinawa. 60 Th e SDF has a range of 

capabilities —including but not limited to missile defense; intelligence, surveillance, and 

reconnaissance; anti -submarine warfare; logistics support; and humanitarian assistance and

disaster relief —that could feasibly augment a U.S. re sponse. 61 Some e xperts have called for more 

vigorous alliance planning for potential cross -Strait conflict scenarios. 62 

Fundamental to Japan ’s involvement in a potential cross -Strait conflict are domestic legal and 

political considerations. Although Japan ov er the past decade has enhanced its military 

capabilities and the legal powers to deploy them, legal and political barriers would confront a 

Japanese leader who seeks to work in tandem with U.S. military forces .63 Navigating the 

constraining constitutional requirements for Japan to respond militarily could be particularly 

challenging in the absence of a direct PRC attack against Japan. Under Japanese law , crafted to 

abide by the constitution , such scenarios would require the alliance to conduct “prior 

consul tation ” whereby Japan grants the United States “the use of facilities and areas in Japan as 

bases for military combat operations to be undertaken from Japan .” Further, whether the 

government of Japan deems such a scenario an “important influence situation ” or “survival -

threatening situation ” would dictate Japan ’s legal options to respond. 64 

# U.S. World War II –Era Prisoners of War (POWs) 

For decades, U.S. soldiers who were held captive by Imperial Japan during World War II have 

sought official apologies from the Japanese government for their treatment. A number of 

Members of Congress have supported these campaigns. The brutal conditions of Japanese POW 

camps have been widely documented. 65 In May 2009, the Japane se Ambassador to the United 

States attended the last convention of the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor to 

deliver a cabinet -approved apology for their suffering and abuse. In 2010, with the support and 

encouragement of the Obama Administration, the Japanese government financed a 

Japanese/American POW Friendship Program for former American POWs and their immediate 

family members to visit Japan, receive an apology from the sitting Foreign Minister and other 

Japanese Cabinet members, and travel to the sites of their POW camps. Annual trips were held 

from 2010 to 2018. 66 

In 2011 , Congress introduced several resolutions that thanked the government of Japan for its 

apology and for arranging the visitation program. 67 The resolutions also encouraged the J apanese 

government to do more for the U.S. POWs, including by continuing and expanding the visitation 

programs as well as its World War II education efforts. They also called for Japanese companies 

to apologize for their or their predecessor firms ’ use of un - or inadequately compensated forced

Mitsubishi Group) became the first major Japanese company to apologize to U.S. POWs on 

behalf of its predecessor firm, which ran several POW camps that incarcerated over 1,000 

Americans. 68 

# U.S. -Japan Alliance Issues 

The U.S. -Japan alliance has long been an anchor of the U.S. security role in Asia. The alliance ’s

foundational documents 69 give the U.S. military the right to base U.S. troops and other military 

assets o n Japanese territory, undergirding the “forward deployment ” of U.S. troops in East Asia. 

In return, the United States pledges to protect Japan ’s security. The U.S. -Japan alliance was 

originally constructed as a fundamentally asymmetric arrangement —in the 1 950s and 1960s, the 

United States assumed most of the responsibility for Japan ’s defense. O ver the decades , however, 

this partnership has shifted toward more equality as Japan ’s military capabilities and policies 

have evolved. About 54,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Japan and have the exclusive use of 

approximately 85 facilities (see  Figure 2). The U.S. security guarantee to Japan includes 

extended dete rrence, known colloquially as the U.S. “nuclear umbrella. ”

Since the early 2000s, the United States and Japan have improved the operational capability of 

the alliance as a combined force, despite political and legal constraints. Even before the Kishida 

go vernment announced plans to raise defense spending close to 2% of GDP, the Abe 

administration ’s record -high 2019 defense budget had exceeded Japan ’s decades -long unofficial 

cap on defense spending of 1% of GDP. Further, Japan ’s major strategic documents re flect a new 

attention to operational readiness and flexibility. In 2014 , the Diet passed a law permitting the 

SDF to engage in collective self -defense. (See the “Collective Self -Defense ” section below.) 

Unlike 25 years ago, the SDF is now active in overseas missions, including efforts in the 2000s to 

support U.S. -led coalition operations in Afghanistan and the reconstruction of Iraq. Japanese 

military contr ibutions to global operations like counter -piracy patrols relieve some of the burden 

on the U.S. military to manage security challenges. Due to the increased co -location of U.S. and 

Japanese command facilities, coordination and communication have become mo re integrated in 

the past 15 years . The joint response to the 2011 tsunami and earthquake in Japan demonstrated 

the interoperability —and limitations —of the two militaries. The United States and Japan have 

steadily enhanced bilateral cooperation in many oth er aspects of the alliance, such as ballistic 

missile defense, cybersecurity, and military use of space.

# Mutual Defense Guidelines 

In April 2015, the United States and Japan announced the revision of th eir bilateral defense 

guidelines. First codified in 1978 and later updated in 1997, the guidelines outline how the U.S. 

and Japanese militaries will interact in peacetime and in war, as the basic framework for defense 

cooperation based on a division of lab or. The revised guidelines account for developments in 

military technology, improvements in interoperability of the U.S. and Japanese militaries, and the 

complex nature of security threats in the 21 st century. For example, the 2015 revision addressed 

bilat eral cooperation on cybersecurity, the use of space for defense purposes, and ballistic missile 

defense, none of which were mentioned in the 1997 guidelines. The revised guidelines also laid 

out a framework for bilateral, whole -of -government cooperation in defending Japan ’s outlying 

islands and expanded the scope of U.S. -Japan security cooperation to include defense of sea lanes 

and, potentially, Japanese contributions to U.S. military operations outside East Asia. 

The revised bilateral defense guidelines also sought to improve alliance coordination. The 

guidelines establish ed a standing Alliance Coordination Mechanism (ACM), which involve s

participants from all relevant agencies in the U.S. and Japanese governments, as the main body 

for coordinating a bila teral response to any contingency. The ACM provides a platform for 

peacetime planning as well as for contingency and crisis situations. This mechanism remove d

obstacles that had inhibited alliance coordination in the past , though one study in 2016 question ed 

whether it is capable of effectively coordinating alliance actions in a military conflict. 70 

# Collective Self -Defense 

Perhaps the most symbolically significant —and controversial —security reform Japan has 

undertaken over the past 30 years was a set of moves in 2014 -20 15 allowing Japan ’s potential 

participation in collective self -defense. Under the U.N. Charter, collective self -defense is the right 

to defend another country that has been attacked by an aggressor. 71 Former Prime Minister Abe 

pushed to adju st a highly asymmetric aspect of the alliance: the inability of Japan to defend U.S. 

forces or territory under attack. Article 9 of the Japanese constitution renounces the use of force 

as a means of settling international disputes . However, Japan has inter preted Article 9 to mean 

that it can maintain a military for national defense purposes and, since 1991, has allowed the SDF 

to participate in non combat roles overseas in a number of U.N. peacekeeping missions and in the 

U.S. -led coalition in Iraq. The Abe government expanded that interpretation and in 2015 passed a 

security legislation package that provides a legal framework for new SDF missions. The removal 

of the blanket prohibition on collective self -defense enables Japan to engage more in cooperative 

se curity activities, like noncombat logistical operations and defense of distant sea lanes, and to be 

more effective in other areas, like U.N. peacekeeping operations. 

# Realignment of the U.S. Military Presence on Okinawa 

Due to the legacy of the U.S. occupa tion and the island ’s key strategic location, Okinawa hosts a 

disproportionate share of the U.S. military presence in Japan . (The westernmost point of the 

Ryukyu Island Chain, of which Okinawa is a part, is less than 70 miles from the coast of Taiwan.)

Abo ut 25% of all facilities used by U.S. Forces Japan (USFJ) and over half of USFJ military 

personnel are located in the prefecture, which comprises less than 1% of Japan ’s total land area. 

Many native Okinawans reportedly resent the large U.S. military prese nce, reflecting in part the 

island ’s tumultuous history and complex relationships with “mainland ” Japan and with the United 

States. Although Okinawans ’ views are far from monolithic, many Okinawans —including those 

who largely support the U.S. -Japan allianc e—express concerns about the burden of hosting 

foreign troops, particularly about issues like crime, safety, environmental degradation, and 

noise. 72 As a result, t he sustainability of the U.S. military presence in Okinawa remains a critical 

challenge for th e alliance. 73 

In 1996, the alliance established a Special Action Committee on Okinawa, which mandated the 

return to Okinawa of thousands of acres of land used by the U.S. military since World War II. 

Subsequent bilateral negotiations aimed at addressing loc al resistance culminated in the 2006 

U.S. -Japan Roadmap for Realignment, in which United States agreed to remove roughly 8,000 

marines from Okinawa to Guam by 2014. Congressional concerns over the scope and cost of the 

Guam realignment, as well as broader U.S. government concerns about Guam ’s preparedness, led 

to lat er revisions that adjusted the number of personnel and dependents to be relocated. 

The central —and most controversial —task of the realignment on Okinawa is to move Marine 

Corps Air Station (MCAS ) Futenma from crowded Ginowan City to Camp Schwab in Nago 

City ’s less congested Henoko area. The encroachment of residential areas around the Futenma 

base over the decades has raised the risks of a fatal aircraft accident. Most Okinawans oppose the 

constr uction of a new U.S. base for a mix of political, environmental, and quality -of -life reasons, 

and demand the Futenma Replacement Facility be moved outside Okinawa. 74 In February 2019, 

Okinawa held a nonbinding referendum on the relocation of the U.S. base. About 72% of those 

who voted opposed the construction of the new base. 75 

The relocation of MCAS Futenma is frequently challenged by local politicians and activists and is 

also beset by construction delays. 76 In three successive elections, most recently in September 

2022, Okinawan citizens have elected governors who ran on platforms opposed to the relocation 

plan and who employed a variety of political and legal strategies to prevent or delay construction 

of t he base. In the months before the 2022 gubernatorial election, however, LDP -backed 

candidates who were more friendly to the relocation scored upset victories, raising the prospect 

that politics could be shifting in the prefecture. In the October 2021 parli amentary elections, two 

ruling LDP candidates for Okinawa ’s seats defeated the anti -base All Okinawa party, and two 

more LDP candidates secured proportional representation seats. In January and February 2022 

mayoral races on Okinawa —including in the city a djacent to Camp Schwab —incumbent 

candidates backed by the central government also won re -election over the All Okinawa

among younger Okinawan voters. 78 

# Burden -Sharin g Issues 

Calculating how much Tokyo pays to defray the cost of hosting the U.S. military presence in 

Japan is difficult and depends heavily on how the contributions are counted. Further, the two 

governments present estimates based on different data depend ing on the political aims of the 

mathematical exercise. Because of the skepticism among some Japanese about paying the U.S. 

military, for example, the Japanese government may use different baselines in justifying its 

contributions to the alliance when argu ing for its budget in the Diet. Other questions make it 

challenging to assess the value and costs of the U.S. military presence in Japan. Is the value to the 

United States determined strictly on activities that provide for the defense of Japan, in a narrow 

sense? Or is the system of American bases in Japan valuable because it enables the United States 

to more quickly, easily, and cheaply disperse U.S. power in the Western Pacific? U.S. defense 

officials often cite the strategic advantage of forward -deployin g the most advanced American 

military capabilities in the Asia -Pacific at a far lower cost than stationing troops on U.S. soil. 

Determining the percentage of overall U.S. costs that Japan pays is even more complicated. 

According to D OD’s 2004 Statistical Compendium on Allied Contributions to the Common 

Defense (the last year for which the report was required), Japan provided 74.5% of the U.S. 

stationing cost .79 In January 2017, Japan ’s Defense Minister provided data that set the Japanese 

portion of the tota l cost for U.S. forces stationed in Japan at over 86%. 80 Other estimates from 

various media reports are in the 40 -50% range. Many analysts concur that there is no 

authoritative, widely shared view on an accurate figure that captures the percentage that Japa n

shoulders. 

Host Nation Support 

One component of Japan ’s contribution is t he Japanese government ’s payment of $1.7 billion -

$2.1 billion per year (depending on the yen -to -dollar exchange rate) to offset the direct cost of 

stationing U.S. forces in Japan. These contributions are provided both in -kind and in cash. 81 For 

at least the past decade , the United States has spent $1.9 billion -$2.5 billion per year on non -

personnel costs on top of the Japanese contribution, according to the DOD comptroller. 82

Japanes e host nation support is composed of two funding sources: Special Measures Agreements 

(SMAs) and the Facilities Improvement Program (FIP). Each SMA is a bilateral agreement, 

generally covering five years, which obligates Japan to pay a certain amount for u tility and labor 

costs of U.S. bases and for relocating training exercises away from populated areas. Although 

negotiations for the SMAs are always contentious, tensions surrounding burden -sharing talks 

during the Trump Administration spiked. As the deal n eared expiration in late 2020, the Trump 

Administration reportedly requested a multifold increase. According to former National Security 

Advisor John Bolton, President Trump demanded that Japan increase its contribution to $8 billion 

per year. 83 Shortly aft er Biden assumed the presidency, the two sides agreed to extend the existing 

agreement for an additional year. In December 2021, a new agreement committed Japan to pay 

roughly 7% more than it had in the past: The average annual expenditures for host nation support 

over 2022 -2026 is approximately ¥211.0 billion (roughly $1.5 billion in current exchange rates) .84 

Additional Japanese Contributions 

In addition to host nation support, which offsets costs that the U.S. government would otherwise 

have to pay, Japan subsidize s or compensate s base -hosting communities. These are not costs that 

would be necessarily passed on to the United States, but U.S. and Japanese alliance managers 

argue that the U.S. bases would not be sustainable without these payments to areas affected by the 

U.S. military presence. Based on its ob ligations defined in the U.S. -Japan Mutual Security Treaty, 

Japan also pays the cost of relocating U.S. bases within Japan and rent to any landowners of U.S. 

military facilities in Japan. Japan pays for the majority of the costs associated with three of th e

largest international military base construction projects since World War II: the Futenma 

Replacement Facility in Okinawa (Japan provides $12.1 billion), construction at the Marine 

Corps Air Station Iwakuni (Japan pays 94% of the $4.8 billion), and const ruction of facilities on 

Guam to support the move of 4,800 marines from Okinawa (Japan pays $3.1 billion, about a third 

of the cost of construction). 85 

Japan is also a major purchaser of U.S. defense equipment. Japan is the third -largest recipient of 

overa ll U.S. Foreign Military Sales delivered in the past five decades .86 The United States 

accounted for 94% of Japan ’s arms imports from 2010 to 2020, according to estimates from the 

Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. 87 Recent major acquisitions include Lockheed 

Martin F -35 Joint Strike Fighters, Boeing KC -46 Tankers, Lockheed Martin and General 

Dynamics Aegis weapons systems, Northrup Grumman E -2D Hawkeye airborne early warning 

aircraft, General Dynamics Advanced Amphibious Assault Vehicles, and Boeing/Bell MV -22 

Ospreys.

# Extended Deterrence 

The growing concerns in Tokyo about North Korean nuclear weapons development and China ’s

modernization of its nuclear arsenal in the 2000s garnered renewed attention to the U.S. policy of 

extended deterrence, commonly known as the “nuclear umbrella. ” The U nited States and Japan 

initiated the bilateral Extended Deterrence Dialogue in 2010, perhaps recognizing that Japanese 

confidence in the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence was critical to its effectiveness , as some 

analysts have argued .88 The dialogue is a forum for the United States to assure its ally and for 

both sides to exchange assessments of the strategic environment. The Japanese government 

welcomed the 2018 and 2022 Nuclear Posture Reviews. 89 

Japanese leaders have repeatedly rejected the idea of developing their own nuclear weapons 

arsenal. Although Japan is a ratified signatory to the Treaty on the Non -Proliferation of Nuclear 

Weapons, and Japanese public opinion is largely antinuclear, a lack of confidence in the U.S. 

security guarantee could l ead Tokyo to reconsider its own status as a nonnuclear weapons state. 

Then -candidate Trump in 2016 stated that he was open to Japan (and South Korea) developing its 

own nuclear arsenal to counter the North Korean nuclear threat. 90 Proponents of Japan develo ping 

nuclear weapons argue that this would deter Chinese aggression and allow the United States to 

use its own capabilities elsewhere, essentially freeing up U.S. assets. 91 Other analysts have argued 

that Japan would face negative consequences if it were to develop its own nuclear weapons, 

including significant budgetary costs , reduced international standing in the campaign to 

denuclearize North Korea , and the possible imposition of economic sanctions that would be 

triggered by leaving the global nonprolifer ation regime .92 Some commentators also warn about 

potentially encouraging South Korea and/or Taiwan to develop nuclear weapons capability and 

triggering a counterreaction by China , which might create instability that could lessen Japan ’s

economic and diplom atic influence in the region. 93 For the United States, analysts have note d that 

encouraging Japan to develop nuclear weapons could mean diminished U.S. influence in Asia, the 

unraveling of the U.S. alliance system, and the possibility of creating a destabil izing nuclear arms 

race in Asia. 94

Ballistic Missile Defense and Strike Capabilities 

Japan also plays an active role in extended deterrence through its ballistic missile defense (BMD) 

capabilities , which it began to pursue in 2003, largely in response to the growing ballistic missile 

threat from North Korea . Whereas prior to the introduction of BMD Japan was entirely reliant on 

the U.S. nuclear deterrent, it now actively contributes to extended deterrence, 95 and m any analysts 

see U.S. -Japan efforts on BMD as the most robust aspect of bilateral security cooperation. DOD ’s

2019 Missile Defense Review stated that “Japan is one of our strongest missile defense 

partners. ”96 Japan and the United States both deploy land - and sea -based missile defense systems 

in Japa n. 97 

In an about -face that was reportedly unanticipated by U.S. and Japanese observers , Japan 

announced in June 2020 that it would suspend a high -profile plan to purchase from the United 

States two Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense batteries. The plan had been announced in 2017 

as North Korea ramped up nuclear and ballistic missile testing, and alliance officials had touted 

the move as a central component of Japan ’s defense against North Korea. 98 Aegis Ashore would 

have provided a new layer of defense a gainst incoming North Korean ballistic missiles for Japan 

and U.S. forces stationed there and could have afforded the U.S. military the flexibility to deploy 

its own Aegis ships now defending Japan to other parts of the region, including the South China 

Se a, Philippine Sea, and Indian Ocean. 99 

The 2020 Aegis Ashore reversal intensified a decades -long debate over whether Japan should 

acquire strike capabilities. Although Japan is pursuing other missile systems for defensive 

purposes, it currently does not ha ve the ability to conduct missile strikes on enemy territory. In 

August 2020, shortly before Abe announced his resignation, the LDP called on the Japanese 

government to consider acquiring this capability. 100 Kishida has reportedly said that it is an 

“option ,” and many observers expect this provision to be included in the upcoming defense policy 

documents. 101 Movement toward adopting a strike mission reflects aspirations by some Japanese 

to achieve greater strategic autonomy and could mark a departure from the l ong -standing division 

of labor in the alliance with the United States as the “spear ” and Japan as the “shield. ”102

# Japan ’s Foreign Polic y

Japan ’s foreign policy is broadly shaped by its security alliance with the United States and by its 

concern about China ’s military and economic power. Abe and his two successors have moved to 

diversify Japan ’s international network of relations to pursue its interests. 

# Japan -China Sovereignty Dispute over the Senkaku Islands in the 

# East China Sea 

Japan , China , and Taiwan c laim a group of uninhabited land features 103 in the East China Sea 

known as the Senkaku Island s in Japan, Diaoyu in China, and Diaoyutai in Taiwan. The eight 

small, uninhabited land features are administered by Japan but also claimed by China and Taiwan .

The Senkakus dispute has simmered for decades and first became a major source of discord in 

China -Japan relations in 2010. Tensions have spiked multiple times since then, and although 

Beijing and Tokyo have renewed efforts to deescalate tensions and avoid cla shes, the dispute has 

remained potential kindling for a major flare -up in an increasingly uneasy bilateral relationship. 

Starting in the fall of 2012, in the wake of another intensification of the dispute, China began 

regularly deploying maritime law enfo rcement ships near the islands and stepped up what it 

called “routine ” patrols to assert jurisdiction in “China ’s territorial waters. ”104 The number of 

Chinese vessels entering the territorial sea s105 surrounding the islands from 2013 through August 

2022 range d from zero to 24 per month (and averaged 8.3 per month). While the average number 

of Chinese vessels entering the territorial sea was fairly consistent during that time frame, the 

average number of vessels entering the contiguous zone —a zone extending an additional 12 

nautical miles out from the outer edge of the territorial sea —increased markedly beginning in 

mid -2019 .106 Most of these patrols appear to be conducted by the China Coast Guard, which has 

been instrumental in advancing China ’s interests in disp uted waters in the East and South China 

Seas .107 

China -Japan tensions have played out in the air domain near the Senkakus as well. The 

government of Japan reported that scrambles by Japan Air Self Defense Force aircraft against 

“Chinese aircraft ” increased eightfold between FY 2010 (96 scrambles) and FY 2016 (851 

scrambles). The average number of scrambles from FY2017 to FY 2020 was 568. 108  

> 103

Although the disputed territory commonly is referred to as “isl ands,” it is unclear if any of the features would meet 

the definition of island under international law .

These patrols exemplify how the dispute over the Senkakus has played out primarily in the “gray 

zone, ” defined by some as the ambiguous space between peace and conflict, with nonmilitary 

actors such as coast guards, fishermen, and China ’s maritime militia on the front lines. 109 China ’s

approach to the dispute (as well as its disputes in the South China Sea) appears to be aimed at 

exploiting the gray zone to gradually consolidate its control and influence over contested space 

without escalating to armed conflict. 110 Japan has prioritized enhancing its ability to counter gray 

zone activities in addition to strengthening its traditio nal military capabilities. 111 

Japan ’s administration of the Senkakus is the basis of the U.S. treaty commitment to defend that 

territory. U.S. administrations going back at least to the Nixon Administration have stated that the 

United States takes no positio n on the territorial disputes. However, it has also been U.S. policy 

since 1972 that the 1960 U.S. -Japan Security Treaty covers the Senkakus , because Article 5 of the 

treaty stipulates that the United States is bound to protect “the territories under the A dministration 

of Japan ,” and Japan administers the Senkakus .112 In its own attempt to address this perceived gap 

between U.S. official neutrality on the sovereignty question and its support for Japan against 

China ’s attempts to change the status quo , Congres s inserted in the FY2013 (P.L. 112 -239 ) and 

FY201 8 National Defense Authorization Act s (H.R. 4310 , P.L. 112 -239 ) a resolution stating, 

among other items, that “the unilateral action of a third party will not affect the United States ’

acknowledgment of the administratio n of Japan over the Senkaku Islands. ”113 

China and Japan also dispute maritime rights in the East China Sea more broadly, with Japan 

arguing for a “median line ” equidistant from each country ’s claimed territorial border dividing 

the two countries ’ exclusive economic zones in the East China Sea . China rejects Japan ’s claimed 

median line, arguing that it has maritime rights beyond this line. 114 

# The Quad Signals Broader Approach 

In 2017, the Trump Administration renewed an effort to develop the Quadrilateral Security 

Dialogue, also known as “the Quad, ” a coalition of Australia, India, Japan , and the United States

According to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, coastal states are entitled to an “exclusive

that has adopted a common platform of protecting freedom of navigation and promoting 

democratic values in the region. Abe was an early champion of th e Quad during his first stint at 

prime minister from 2006 to 20 07. The Biden Administration has adopted the initiative, 

convening a virtual leader -level meeting in March 2021. At this summit the leaders announced a 

promise to jointly expand availability of COVID -19 vaccines and deliver up to a billion doses to 

Southeast Asia and the broader Indo -Pacific by the end of 2022. 115 This step, along with a plan to 

reduce dependence on China ’s near -monopoly on rare earth materials used in high -technology 

products and to work together to strengthen the Paris Agreement, could usher in a new chapter in 

cooperation. 

Japan hosted the second -ever in -person Quad summit in May 2022 at which the four countries, 

among other steps, announced a new Indo -Pacific Partnership for M aritime Domain Awareness .

The White House says the partnership aims to offer “a near -real -time, integrated, and cost -

effective ma ritime domain awareness picture ” that will “transform the ability of partners in the 

Pacific Islands, Southeast Asia, and the I ndian Ocean region to fully monitor the waters on their 

shores .” 116 Questions remain about the durability of the arrangement if leadership shifts in 

member countries, whether other countries will be brought into the Quad ’s initiatives, and 

particularly about India ’s inconsistent enthusiasm for the grouping. Many Members of Congress 

have been enthusiastic about the Quad. 117 

Japan has also worked steadily to build closer bilateral security ties with both Australia and 

India. 118 For the past decade Japan has deepene d defense relati ons with Australia, and in 2020 the 

two agreed to a Reciprocal Access Agreement (similar to a Status of Forces Agreement) to define 

rules and procedures when troops are stationed temporarily in the other ’s country for joint 

exercises or dis aster -relief activities. As another U.S. treaty ally, Australia uses similar practices 

and equipment, which may make cooperation with Japan more accessible. Japan has inked an 

Acquisition and Cross -servicing Agreement (the formal mechanism that allow s a co untry to 

acquire or provide logistic support, supplies, and services directly from/to another country) with 

India, along with agreements concerning the protection of classified military information and 

transfer of defense equipment and technology. Bilatera l exercises with both countries have grown 

in number and sophistication. 

# Japan and the Korean Peninsula 

Japan -South Korea Relations 

In the 21 st century, Japan ’s relationship with South Korea has fluctuated between troubled and 

tentatively cooperative, depending on external circumstances and the leaders in power. The state 

of relations is framed by the legacy of history, with current events causin g the spike in tension. 

Many Koreans hold strong grievances about Japan ’s colonial rule over the peninsula (1910 -

1945), especially on the issue of Korean “comfort women ” who were forced to provide sex to 

Japanese soldiers in the World War II era. 119 Relation s often became bitter with Abe in power, 

driven by South Korean criticism of Abe ’s past statements on the two countries ’ contentious 

history and his affiliations with nationalist organizations, as well by Japanese frustration that

> Congressional Research Service 25

South Korean governments were abandoning previously negotiated agreements intended to 

address bilateral conflicts. 

In addition to the comfort women issue (see below), the perennial issues of how Japan ’s behavior 

before and during World War II is depicted in Japanese school textboo ks , and a territorial dispute 

between Japan and South Korea , continue to periodically rile relations. Seoul has expressed 

disapproval of some of the history textbooks approved by Japan ’s Ministry of Education, which 

South Koreans claim diminish or whitewas h Japan ’s colonial -era atrocities. A group of small 

islands in the Sea of Japan, known as Dokdo in Korean and Takeshima in Japanese (the U.S. 

government refers to them as the Liancourt Rocks), are administered by South Korea but claimed 

by Japan. Japanese assertions of their claim in defense documents or by local prefectures 

routinely spark official criticism and public outcry in South Korea. 

Currently, one of the most salient bilateral issue is whether the South Korean Supreme Court 

decides to liquidate t he seized assets of Japanese companies that the court in 2018 ruled must 

compensate South Koreans for forced labor during Japan ’s occupation . Japan argues that the 1965 

Japan –South Korea normalization agreement resolved situations such as compensating forc ed 

laborers. According to press reports, the Yoon administration has established a consultative body 

to seek ways to avoid the liquidation of the seized Mitsubishi Heavy and Nippon Steel 

Corporation assets and has reportedly offered a proposal that involve s compensating the victims 

through an existing South Korean government fund plus statements of regret and voluntary 

contributions from the Japanese corporations. However, it is unclear whether Yoon, who is 

confronting relatively low public approval ratings , can manage the anticipated negative response 

from South Korea ’s opposition parties, which have a majority in South Korea ’s parliament. 120 

Bitter relations between Japan and South Korea dim prospects for effective trilateral cooperation 

with the United Stat es, particularly in responding to North Korean threats. This became clear in 

2019 when South Korea —in the midst of a trade dispute with Japan —threatened to withdraw 

from a bilateral military intelligence sharing agreement with Japan, spurring U.S. official s to 

intervene and convinc e Seoul to remain in the pact. 121 From its initial weeks in office, the Biden 

Administration has sought to “reinvigorate and modernize ” both alliances, and senior 

Administration officials have expressed hope that this effort will in clude more trilateral 

cooperation. 122 Washington , including Congress through various resolutions, has generally 

encouraged closer ties between Tokyo and Seoul as two of its most important alliance partners .

The two countries have shared security concerns ; de veloped economies ; and a commitment to 

open markets, international rules and norms, and regional stability. A poor relationship between 

Seoul and Tokyo jeopardizes U.S. interests by complicating trilateral cooperation on North Korea 

policy and on respondin g to China ’s rise. In 2021 and 2022, the three countries convened a 

number of trilateral meetings ranging from the working level to the heads -of -state level. In a 

further sign that relations were beginning to normalize, in the fall of 2022, Kishida and Yoon held 

two bilateral meetings, the first such meetings since 2019 .

Comfort Women Issue 

A perennial stumbling block to better Japan –South Korean relations involves the “comfort 

women, ” a literal translation of the Japanese euphemism referring to women w ho were forced to 

provide sexual services for Japanese soldiers during the imperial military ’s conquest and 

colonization of several Asian countries in the 1930s and 1940s. In 2015, then -Prime Minister Abe 

and then -President Park Geun -hye of South Korea con cluded an agreement that included Abe 

issuing a new apology from a Japanese premier and the provision of 1 billion yen (about $8.3 

million) from the Japanese government to a new Korean foundation that supports surviving 

victims. 123 The two governments ’ forei gn ministers agreed that this long -standing bilateral rift 

would be “finally and irreversibly resolved ” pending the Japanese government ’s implementation 

of the agreement. 124 Although the main elements of the agreement appeared to have be en 

implemented in 201 6, the deal remain ed deeply unpopular with the South Korea n public , and 

former President Moon Jae -in disband ed the foundation established by the agreement in 2018 .125 

The comfort women issue has had visibility in the Unite d States due in part to Korean -American 

activist groups. These groups have pressed successfully for the erection of monuments in 

California and New Jersey commemorating the victims, passage of a resolution on the issue by 

the New York State Senate, the naming of a city street in the New York City borough of Queens 

in honor of the victims , and approval to erect a memorial to the comfort women in San Francisco. 

In 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.Res. 121 (110 th Congress), calling on the 

Japanese government to “formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical responsibility in 

… an unequivocal manner ” for forcing young women into military prostitution . The resolution 

passed by voice vote and at tracted 167 co -sponsors, driven in part by a June 2007 Washington 

Post advertisement signed by several Japa nese legislators —some of whom Kishida included in 

his August 2022 cabinet —and academics rejecting the historical basis of the resolution. 126 

Japan ’s No rth Korea Policy 

Japan has employed a hardline policy toward North Korea, including a virtual embargo on all 

bilateral trade, and has been a vocal proponent of efforts by United Nations to punish Pyongyang 

for its human rights abuses and military provocati ons. Japan is directly threatened by North Korea 

given the demonstrated capability of Pyongyang ’s medium -range missiles. In October 2022, 

North Korea test -launched a long -range ballistic missile that flew over northern Japan, the first 

test to fly over Jap anese territory in five years. North Korea has long -standing animosity toward 

Japan for its colonialism of the Korean peninsula in the early 20 th century. When multilateral 

diplomacy with North Korea was more active, one of the potential elements of a broa d deal was a 

Japanese assistance package in recognition of the suffering caused during this period —along the 

lines of the aid Japan negotiated when it normalized relations with South Korea in 1965 —that 

could be worth several billions of dollars. 127 North Kor ea may also target U.S. bases in Japan in 

the event of a conflict.

In addition to direct security concerns, Japan has prioritized addressing the long -standing issue of 

Japanese citizens kidnapped in the 1970s and 1980s by North Korean agents. In 2002, then -North 

Korean leader Kim Jong -il admitted to the abductions and returned five survivors, claiming that 

the others had perished from natural causes. Japan ’s government officially identifies 17 

individuals as abductees and says that relations can never be no rmalized without resolution of this 

issue. 128 

Coordination between Japan and the United States on North Korean policy has fluctuated 

depending on the approach taken by different U.S. leaders. In general, when the United States has 

engaged North Korea with di plomacy, Japanese leaders have expressed concern that the abductee 

issue does not receive sufficient attention. Under the Trump Administration, Tokyo supported 

Trump ’s initial “maximum pressure ” approach . W hen Trump turned to personal diplomacy with 

Kim Jong -un in 2018 and 2019, Japanese officials expressed concern that the United States would 

make a deal on long -range missiles that left Japan vulnerable. According to many analysts, some 

Japanese are unconvi nced that North Korea will give up its nuclear weapons or missiles and fear 

that Tokyo ’s interests vis -à-vis Pyongyang will be marginalized if U.S. –North Korea relations 

warm. 129 When the Six -Party Talks ( established to deal with North Korea ’s nuclear weapon s

program and that included Japan, South Korea, North Korea, China, Russia, and the United 

States) were active, U.S. officials identified Japan a key actor in a possible resolution of problems 

on the Korean peninsula, but the multilateral format has been d ormant since 2009. 

# Relations with Southeast Asia 

For decades, Japan has pursued productive relations with Southeast Asian countries, providing 

generous official development assistance and earning broadly positive reviews from regional 

leaders. In one 2020 survey, Southeast Asians rated Japan as the most trusted major power. 130 

With China ’s rising influence, Tokyo has redoubled these efforts. Japanese officials frequently 

visit the region , and the government has launched several initiatives that emphasize capa city -

building in the security sphere. Japan ’s approach generally complements U.S. policy toward 

Southeast Asian countries, with both the United States and Japan pursuing strong relations with 

Vietnam and the Philippines in particular. Japan has developed s tronger relations with countries 

such as Cambodia and Burma, in contrast to the United States, which has placed sanctions and 

restrictions on interactions with their authoritarian regimes. S ome s cholars argue that by utilizing 

their respective comparative advantages, the United States and Japan can coordinate for a 

broader, more strategic joint approach to Southeast Asia. 131 Under the Biden and Trump 

Administrations, the United States and Japan have launched a number of initiatives to cooperate 

on infrastruct ure projects, including many involving significant public -private partnerships, in 

Southeast Asia. 132

# Economic Issues 

U.S. trade and economic ties with Japan are assessed by many experts and policymakers as highly 

important to the U.S. national interest. By the most conventional method of measurement, the 

United States and Japan are the world ’s largest and third -largest economies (China is number 

two), accounting for about 30% of the world ’s GDP in 2021. 133 Furthermore, their economies are 

closely intertwined by two -way trade in goods and services and by investment in each other ’s

economies. 

# Overview of the Bilateral Economic Relationship 

Japan was the United States ’ fifth -largest export market for goods and services (behind Canada, 

Mexico, China, and the Unit ed Kingdom) and the fifth -largest source of U.S. imports (behind 

China, Mexico, Canada, and Germany) in 2021. Japan accounted for 4% of total U.S. exports in 

2021 ($112 billion) and 5% of total U.S. imports ($168 billion). 134 The United States was Japan ’s

se cond -largest goods export market and second -largest source of goods imports (after China) in 

2021. 135 Japan is also a major investor in the United States, accounting for more than 14% of the 

stock of inward foreign direct investment in 2021 ($690 billion). 136 U.S. affiliates of Japanese 

multinational firms employed about 1 million U.S. workers in 2020 (latest available data). 

The relative significance of the bilateral economic relationship for the United States has arguably 

declined as other countries, including China, have become increasingly important global 

economic actors. 137 Some of this shift stems from structural changes in the global economic 

landscape, including the growth of global supply chains. Data fr om the Organization for 

Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) suggest that even on a value -added basis, 

which adjusts conventional trade data by attributing intermediate components of traded products 

to their country of origin, Japan accounts for a d eclining share of U.S. import activity. 138 At the 

same time, U.S. import figures may underestimate the importance of Japan and Japanese 

companies in U.S. consumption patterns since Japanese firms have invested heavily in export -

oriented production facilities in Asia and around the world as well as directly in the United States. 

U.S. trade with Japan has largely risen over the past few decades. Major economic events have 

also influenced U.S. -Japan trade patterns in recent years, such as the global economic dow nturn 

stemming from the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID -19 pandemic, which dampened both 

U.S. exports and imports. The decline in the value of the Japanese yen since 2012 —which hit 

historic lows in 2022 and is tied to aggressive monetary stimulus in Ja pan as part of “Abenomics ”

(described below) —likely affected both the value and quantity of trade as measured in yen.

The Trump Administration ’s trade policy largely focused on challenging “unfair ” trading 

practices, boosting U.S. import competition, and reducing bilateral trade deficits and strained U.S. 

economic relations with Japan and other countries. U.S. and Japan ese officials addressed some of 

these concerns in limited trade agreements reached in 2019 (see below). The Biden 

Administration emphasizes that while opening markets and reducing trade barriers remains 

fundamental to its trade agenda, repairing U.S. partnerships and alliances is a major priority. 139 

Key issues in the bilateral trade relationship of ongoing U.S. attention and of priority for so me 

Members of Congress include concerns over market access for U.S. products such as autos and 

agricultural goods and various nontariff barriers, which U.S. companies argue favor domestic 

Japanese products. 140 The United States has also prioritized renewed r egional economic 

engagement with its launch of the IPEF with Japan and 12 other trading partners. Japan has 

welcomed U.S. engagement and analysts see it as a key partner for IPEF (see below). The 

Japanese government, in addition to major auto producers the EU and South Korea, has recently 

raised concerns over new requirements for electric vehicle (EV) tax credits in P.L. 117 -169 

(commonly referred to as the Inflation Reducti on Act of 2022) and potential discriminatory 

effects, which some observers see as potentially injecting some tension in the IPEF talks. 141 

Despite some renewed trade tensions, the major trend in U.S. -Japan bilateral economic relations 

over the past two decad es has largely been easing tension, in particular compared to the 

contentious and frequent trade frictions at the fore of the bilateral relationship in the 1980s and 

early 1990s. By contrast, increasing tension in the U.S. -China economic relationship, part icularly 

threats of decoupling, presents significant risks to Japan given its extensive economic ties with 

both countries. 

# Japan ’s Domestic Economy: Seeking Growth amid Challenges 

In their first ever “Economic 2+2” meeting held in July 2022, U.S. and Japanese officials 

emphasized the need to make their economies more competitive and resilient amid various risks 

and uncertainties in the global economy. 142 Prime Minister Kishida inherited a challenging 

domestic economic landscape in the wake of COVID -19 an d, more broadly, in building on the 

legacy of Abe ’s economic policies. Japan ’s economy grew rapidly from the end of World War II 

through the 1980s. However, since the collapse of an asset bubble in the early 1990s, the Japanese 

government has struggled to end persistent deflation (decreasing prices) and weak economic

growth. For the past three decades Japan ’s GDP growth has been below most advanced 

economies, including the United States (see  Figure 3).143

Brief periods of recovery have continually been followed by devastating economic events, 

including the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s ; the global financial crisis in the late 2000s ;

and the earthquake, tsunami, and nuclear reactor meltdown in northeastern Japan in 2011. (For 

more on Japan ’s “triple disaster, ” see the “Nuclear Energy ” section below.) 

Most recently, the global recession caused by the COVID -19 pandemic has been acutely felt in 

Japan. International tourism, for example, had been a targeted growth sector in recent years 

before the pandemic effectively halted such activities in 2020, including tourism related to the 

Tokyo Olympics. Japan ’s economy contracted by 4.5 % in 2020 and grew 1.7% in 2021 —a

relatively low rebound compared to other advanced economies. 144 The economy underperformed 

relative to expectations and contracted in the third quarter of 2022 , raising further concerns over 

sustained recovery. 145 As such, the government remains focused on economic recovery from the 

pandemic, with continued fiscal and monetary support. 146 In October 2022, Kishida announced a 

new package of economic measures worth ¥39 trillion ($264 billion), building on past stimulus 

for economic relief from rising food and energy prices. 147 The B oJ, unlike other central banks, 

remains committed to loose monetary policy, taking actions to prevent interest rate increases. 148 

Japan ’s ultra -low interest rates —the BoJ ’s policy rate is set at minus 0.1% —ha ve in turn put 

downward pressure on the yen, which fell to historic lows against the dollar i n the fall of 2022,

prompting Bo J intervention for the first time since 1998. Japanese officials have historically 

lauded a weak yen, which makes Japan ’s exports c heaper and imports more expensive and 

supports the Kishida government ’s aim to boost tourism spending, but the weaker yen ’s effect on 

import costs is of increasing concern given soaring costs of imported energy and other 

commodities. 149 

In addition to the effects of the pandemic, Japan faces a number of ongoing, long -term structural 

economic challenges. Primary among these is a rapidly aging and shrinking population, which 

among other difficulties places increasing strain on a heavily indebted government, a s the 

working age population declines relative to retirees. 150 At 259% of GDP in 2020, the size of 

Japan ’s federal government ’s gross debt relative to its economy was already the largest in the 

world before it implemented massive fiscal stimulus in response to COVID -19. 151 Attempt ing to 

put Japan on a path of long -term fiscal sustainability without disrupting the economy in the short -

term has proven a difficult balancing act. Consumption tax increases in 2014 and in 2019 pushed 

down domestic consumption , result ing in sizeable quarterly economic contractions. As a result, 

Japan ’s economy was already in the midst of contraction when the COVID -19 shutdowns took 

effect. 

Faced with a declining working -age population and an aversion to immigration, Japan ’s future 

econ omic growth depends on increasing labor productivity (the output of each individual 

worker), which has grown slowly for the past several decades and declined relative to other major 

economies. 152 Although the causes of this decline are debated, many economis ts see Japan ’s rigid 

and bifurcated labor market as a significant impediment to improving productivity. The rigidity in 

the system stems from the traditional Japanese employment model, a result of both cultural and 

legal structures in which “salaryman ” wor kers accept a grueling work schedule in exchange for 

the benefit of long -term job security with pay strongly linked to seniority. 153 Some experts have 

argued that this “job -for -life ” system potentially dampens productivity by lowering the incentive 

to learn new skills during the course of a career and by impeding the dissemination of innovations 

and best practices that would normally occur when workers change from one employer to 

another. 154 Businesses have made the employment system more flexible by expanding the group 

of nonregular or temporary employees who garner less competitive salaries and face easier 

dismissal than their salaryman counterparts. Since the 1980s, the share of nonregular workers in 

the workforce has grown from 15% to nearly 40%, with women accounting for the bulk of the 

growth. 155 Instead of improving productivity, many analysts see this dual system as having 

exacerbated the problem while adding to concerns over gender inequality. 156 The Japanese 

government has attempted to reform the system, in cluding through legal measures to ensure that

nonregular workers receive “equal pay for equal work, ” but enforcing such provisions has proven 

a challenge. 157 A related challenge, which may also help explain Japan ’s sluggish wage growth 

despite its tight labo r market, is the disparity in productivity between firms, which is among the 

highest in the OECD. 158 

Former Prime Minister Abe attempted to tackle a number of these domestic challenges through a 

three -pronged economics program known as “Abenomics. ” The prog ram ’s three components or 

“arrows ” consisted of expansionary monetary policy, flexible fiscal stimulus, and structural 

reforms. The BoJ has deployed unprecedented levels of monetary stimulus, including quantitative 

easing through massive purchases of gover nment bonds and the use of negative interest rates to 

encourage lending. Government spending under Abe was also largely stimulative, but some 

observers argue that consumption tax increases in 2014 and 2019 put unnecessary strain on a still 

weak economy. 159 The Abe government also made some progress on structural reforms , including 

in the energy and agriculture sectors and in corporate governance, and sought to spur productivity 

by opening the Japanese marketplace to greater international competition, lowering tariff and 

nontariff barriers through a series of trade agreements. Another key component focused on 

“womenomics, ” or boosting economic growth through policies to encourage the participation and 

advancement of women in the workforce (see text box ). 160

Mixed  Success of “Womenomics” 

A key component of the third arrow in Abe’s economic reform focused on “womenomics,” or boosting economic 

growth through reforms and policies to encourage the participation and advancement of women in the 

workforce. 161  Japan lags be hind many other high -income countries in gender equality and continues to underutilize 

the potential of its female labor force. Women  were  also disproportionately affected by employment cuts in 

response to the pandemic, as they are highly over -represented  among Japan’s nonregular workers. 162  To advance 

“womenomics,” the government has proposed or implemented a number of policies, such as expanding the 

availability of day care. Japan’s overall female participation rate in the labor force increased from 48% in  2012 to 

53% in 2021. 163 

Despite some progress, a dearth of women in top management and government positions has left many 

disappointed in the results. 164  Japan’s position in the World Economic Forum’s national rankings of gender equality 

remains low —116 th  out  of 146 countries in 2022. 165  Japan fared worse in political empowerment rankings (139 th ), 

reflecting the relatively low number of female legislators and high -ranking government officials. According to the 

OECD, in 2021 women occupied 12.6% of board seats  across major Japanese companies, compared to 29.7% in 

the United States. 166  Japan’s pay differential or gender wage gap at 22.1% was the third -highest in the OECD in 

2021, which researchers attribute largely to lack of female leadership in the workplace. 167  In  May 2022, Prime 

Minister Kishida announced plans to require large companies to disclose their gender wage gap s as part of efforts 

to  improve transparency and address disparities. 168 

Overall, the program appears to have had moderate success, primarily by halting deflation. Price 

levels exceeded their previous 1998 peak for the first time in recent years (see  Figure 4). 169 In 

addition, during Abe ’s tenure the labor force participation rate increased as additional workers, 

especially women, joined the labor force, despite a declining working age population (see  Figure 

5). In 2019 , the unemployment rate fell to 2.4%, its lowest levels in more than 25 years , and 

increased slightly to 2.8% since the pandemic .170 Some analysts also credit the program with 

injecting optimism into Japan ’s economy after its decades -long period of sluggish economic 

growth coupled with its demographic challenges had given rise to a narrative of Japan as a nation 

in decline. 171

Many analysts agree, however, that further structural reforms remain vital for Japan to maintain 

its standard of living in the face of persistent demographic challenges. 172 To mitigate these 

challenges and enhance economic growth, the International Monetary Fund , for example, has 

recommended prioritizing (1) la bor market reforms aimed at increasing participation among 

women, older workers, and foreigners, and reducing distortive effects of Japan ’s two -tier labor 

market system by providing more training for nonregular workers; (2) reforms to increase long -

term pr oductivity growth (such as deregulation aimed at facilitating expansion of higher 

productivity small - and medium -sized enterprises and exit of poor -performing firms); and (3) 

continued reduction of tariff and nontariff barriers. 173 The COVID -19 pandemic in p articular has 

further highlighted the structural inequities in the Japanese labor market : W omen, young, and 

nonregular workers who remain overrepresented in vulnerable industries were hit particularly 

hard .174 

Prime Minister Kishida has pledged to correct fo r the perceived shortcomings of Abenomics with 

a focus on a “new form of capitalism ” aimed toward reducing social disparities and driving 

broad -based growth in the economy. 175 His plan calls for more investment in human capital and 

expanded support of innova tion and startups, as well as efforts to decarbonize the economy and 

advance digitalization. While the response to the economic fallout from the COVID -19 pandemic 

remains at the forefront, Kishida has emphasized economic priorities including supply chain

# U.S. Tariffs Modified Under the Biden Administration 

Unilateral tariff increases on several significant U.S. imports from Japan imposed during the 

Trump Administration remain in place under the Biden Administration with some 

modifications. 177 In 2018, President Trump announced tariffs of 25% and 10% on certain U.S. 

steel and aluminum imports, respectively. 178 The tar iffs, imposed under Section 232 of the Trade 

Expansion Act of 1962 on the premise that such imports threaten U.S. national security, drew 

criticism from Japan (the fifth -largest supplier of affected U.S. steel imports in 2020) given its 

close security rela tionship with the United States. Japan did not retaliate against the tariff actions, 

in contrast to other trading partners including the EU and China. Japan, however, appeared to be a 

relatively significant beneficiary of the Department of Commerce ’s produ ct exclusion process, 

which allowed U.S. importers to petition the government for tariff relief on individual products 

from specific countries. 179 Bilateral tensions heightened further when President Trump also 

declared auto imports, including from Japan, a national security threat, but the U.S. government 

ultimately refrained from imposing additional tariffs. 180 

The Biden Administration has expressed preference for multilateral solutions to the economic 

issues the Trump Administration sought to address throug h its tariff actions, including 

overcapacity in the global steel market, while acknowledging that tariffs are a legitimate and at 

times necessary U.S. trade policy tool. 181 In February 2022, the Biden Administration reached an 

agreement with Japan to partly lift the Section 232 tariffs through a tariff -rate quota, which 

exempts up to 1.25 million metric tons of Japanese steel annually from the 25% tariff. 182 

Japanese exports of washing machines and solar panels were also subject to additional temporary 

U.S. sa feguard tariffs imposed under Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 to address serious or 

threatened serious injury from these imports to domestic industries. U.S. safeguards on large 

washers are currently in effect through 2023 . I n February 2022, President Biden extended the 

safeguard tariffs on solar products, with some product exclusions, for four years until 2026. 183

# U.S. -Japan Trade Negotiations 

After facing potential Section 232 auto tariffs, Japan agreed to enter into negotiations with the 

United State s on a bilateral trade agreement. In October 2019, the United States and Japan signed 

two agreements: the U.S. -Japan Trade Agreement (USJTA), which provides for limited tariff 

reductions and quota expansions to improve market access, and the U.S. -Japan Dig ital Trade 

Agreement. The agreements, which took effect in January 2020, without formal action by 

Congress, constituted what the Trump and Abe Administrations described as “stage one ” of a 

broader U.S. -Japan trade agreement, but further talks did not mater ialize. 

The USJTA commitments cover about 5% of bilateral trade. Under its provisions, the United 

States is reducing tariffs on mostly industrial goods and certain Japanese niche agricultural 

products. Japan is reducing or eliminating tariffs on about 600 agricultural tariff lines, such as 

beef, pork, and cheese, and expanding preferential tariff -rate quotas (which permit access for a 

specified quantity at a specified tariff rate). Opening Japan ’s highly protected agriculture sector 

(the fourth -largest U.S . agriculture market in 2021) and reaching parity with exporters from 

Japan ’s FTA partners were key drivers of the agreement for the United States. 184 The USJTA does 

not cover trade in motor vehicles, a driver of the U.S. bilateral trade deficit and long -sta nding 

area of bilateral tension. 185 The agreement on digital trade, an area in which the two countries 

have broadly similar goals, largely reflects the digital trade rules in the 2020 U.S. -Mexico -Canada 

Agreement. 

The limited scope agreement was a significan t shift in approach from recent U.S. FTAs, which 

typically involve one comprehensive negotiation. The Trump Administration used delegated tariff 

authorities in Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to proclaim the tariff provisions, while treating 

the digital tr ade agreement, which did not require changes to U.S. law, as an Executive 

Agreement. 186 Some Members of Congress and U.S. stakeholders raised questions regarding the 

congressional role in approving trade agreements and urged second -stage talks to achieve a 

comprehensive deal. 187 Expeditious reduction of Japan ’s agricultural tariffs, however, was widely 

supported in Congress and by some U.S. agriculture stakeholders given growing concerns that 

Japan ’s other trade agreements disadvantage U.S. exports. 188 At the sam e time, many industries 

expressed concerns about the extent of USJTA ’s new market access or lack of attention to other 

key issues typically covered in comprehensive FTAs.

Japan has continued to enter trade agreements with its other trading partners. Follo wing U.S. 

withdrawal from the TPP in 2017, Japan led efforts among the remaining 11 countries to conclude 

the CPTPP, which took effect in December 2018 for Japan. Japan ’s FTA with the EU, which went 

into effect soon after in 2019, is to eventually remove n early all tariffs, including for example the 

EU ’s 10% auto tariff. 189 In addition, in early 2022, the Regional Comprehensive Economic 

Partnership entered into force and will lower trade barriers among Japan and 14 other Asian 

members, including China. 190 Some experts and Members of Congress see the advancement of 

mega -regional trade deals without U.S. participation as limiting U.S. economic and strategic 

influence in the Asia -Pacific . O ther stakeholders and Members have supported the United States 

not participa ting in agreements such as the CPTPP. 191 Th ose concerned over limited U.S. 

influence contend, moreover, that following TPP withdrawal, the United States failed to present 

an alternative economic strategy in the region. 192 While Japan continued to urge the Unit ed States 

to consider joining the CPTPP, the Biden Administration has currently expressed no such interest. 

In May 2022, Japan joined 13 other countries as an inaugural negotiating partner in the U.S. -led 

IPEF initiative. IPEF appears to be the Administrat ion ’s response to urging from policymakers, 

stakeholders, and U.S. allies such as Japan for the United States to advance a more robust trade 

agenda in the region. 193 IPEF will not take the form of a traditional comprehensive U.S. FTA and 

instead involves commitments in four separate “pillars ” covering (1) select trade issues (e.g., 

labor, environment, digital trade, trade facilitation) ; (2) supply chains ; (3) infrastr ucture and 

decarbonization ; and (4) tax and anti -corruption. IPEF members held their first in -person 

ministerial meeting in September 2022. 194 The Biden Administration has said it sees the potential 

agreement as attracting a broad base of U.S. domestic support, which it argues was missing from 

the TPP. 195 Unlike U.S. FTAs, IPEF will not cover tariffs and comprehensive market access 

provisions. The Administration has also suggested that IPEF is to take the form of executive 

agreements, which has prompted concern among some Members who say that the Administration 

is potentiall y circumventing “congressional input, authority, and approval. ”196 In December 2022, 

a group of Members of the Senate Finance Committee asserted that Congress must have a role in 

approving any future IPEF agreement as it aims to regulate foreign commerce and reshape 

international trade flows. 197 Some Members of Congress and stakeholders support IPEF as an

opportunity for the United States to take a lead role in establishing updated trade and economic 

rules in partnership with key partners in the region. At the same time, some observers have raised 

concerns over IPEF ’s potential lack of substantive commitments, including in market access, and 

overall ambition to deepen economic linkages. 198 Japan and IPEF partner countries have generally 

welcomed U.S. engagement vi a the framework but also voiced various concerns and hopes for the 

agreement. 199 

The Biden Administration is concurrently pursuing other bilateral initiatives and economic 

engagement with Japan. It announced a new Competitiveness and Resilience (CoRe) Partn ership 

with Japan during the April 2021 bilateral summit, which is to focus on cooperation in 

technological innovation. 200 The Administration also launched a cooperative U.S. -Japan 

Partnership on Trade to advance collaboration and engagement on common areas of interest and 

address specific trade issues. 201 The Administration has emphasized the importance of working 

with allies such as Japan to meet the challenges posed by China. The United States, European 

Union, and Japan recently renewed trilateral talks, whi ch had been held intermittently since 2018, 

“to address the global challenges posed by non -market policies and practices of third countries 

that undermine and negatively affect our workers and businesses. ”202 

# Energy and Climate Issues 

Unlike security cooper ation, which has reflected continuity across recent U.S. and Japanese 

governments, U.S. -Japan cooperation on energy, climate, and other environmental issues has been 

more prone to changing priorities by U.S. and Japanese political leaders. 

# Energy 

Enhancing energy security is a high priority for Japan ’s policymakers. The country ’s archipelagic 

geography and vulnerability to natural disasters, limited domestic energy sources, and under -

connected energy transmission infrastructure make it vulnerable t o energy supply and 

transmission disruptions. Japan ’s reliance on imported oil and natural gas for more than 90% of 

its energy needs has led policymakers to seek to diversify the country ’s energy sources. 203

The United States and Japan convene several energy -focused dialogues and initiatives. 204 These 

aim to promote shared energy security, accelerate “the clean energy transition ” in both countries, 

and facilitate public -private efforts to provide access to “affordable, clean, and reliable energy ” in 

third countries, particularly in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Islands. 205 

Nuclear Energy 

Japan is undergoing a national debate over the future of nuclear energy, with major implications 

for Japan ’s energy diversification efforts, U.S. businesses operating in Japan, and nuclear safety 

and nonproliferat ion measures worldwide. In 2010, nuclear power was providing roughly 30% of 

Japan ’s power generation capacity, with the Japanese government aspiring to increase that share 

to as much as 40% by 2030. 206 

However, the policy to further expand nuclear power was abruptly reversed in the aftermath of 

the March 11, 2011, natural disasters and meltdowns at the Fukushima Dai -ichi nuclear power 

plant (see text box, below). Public trust in the safety of nuclear power collapsed, and a vocal 

antinuclear political movemen t emerged. 207 This movement tapped into an undercurrent of 

popular antinuclear sentiment, a legacy of the U.S. atomic bomb attacks on Japan in 1945. 

Following the disaster, all of the country ’s 54 nuclear reactors were shut down until 2015, when 

some gradual ly began to come back online. As of October 2022, Japan had 33 operable reactors, 

with two more under construction. 208 The drawdown of nuclear power generation resulted in 

many short - and long -term consequences for Japan: increased fossil fuel imports; risin g electricity 

costs for residences and businesses; heightened risk of blackouts in the summer; widespread 

energy conservation efforts by businesses, government agencies, and ordinary citizens; and 

significant losses for and near -bankruptcy of major utility companies. 209

Japan’s  March 2011 “Triple Disaster” 

In March 2021, Japan observed the  10 th  anniversary of what it refers to as the “triple disaster.”  On March 11, 

2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake jolted a wide swath of Honshu, Japan’s largest island , shiftin g it eastward 

approximately  eight  feet . The quake generated a tsunami  that  pounded Honshu’s northeastern coast, causing 

widespread destruction. Some 20,000 lives were lost, and entire towns were washed away . O ver 500,000 homes 

and other buildings and aroun d 3,600 roads were damaged or destroyed. Up to half -a-million Japanese  people 

were displaced. Damage to several reactors at the Fukushima Dai -ichi nuclear power plant complex led the 

government to declare a state of emergency and evacuate nearly 80,000 res idents within a 20 -kilometer radius 

due to dangerous radiation levels. 

Japan’s  immediate  response to the multifaceted disaster  received widespread praise . Over 100,000  SDF  troops 

deployed quickly to the region. After rescuing nearly 20,000 individuals in  the first week, the troops turned to a 

humanitarian relief mission in the displaced communities. Construction of temporary housing began a week after 

the quake. Japan’s preparedness —strict building codes, a tsunami warning system that alerted many to seek  higher 

ground, and years of public drills —likely saved tens of thousands of lives. 

Appreciation for the U.S. -Japan alliance  among the Japanese public  surged after the two militaries worked 

effectively together to respond to the earthquake and tsunami. Yea rs of joint training and many interoperable 

assets facilitated the integrated alliance effort. “Operation Tomodachi,” using the Japanese word for “friend,” was 

the first time that SDF helicopters used U.S. aircraft carriers to respond to a crisis. The USS  Ronald Reagan  aircraft 

carrier provided a platform for air operations as well as a refueling base for SDF and Japan ese  coast  guard 

helicopters. Other U.S. vessels transported SDF troops and equipment to the disaster -stricken areas. For the first 

time, U.S.  military units operated under Japanese command in actual operations. 

Since 2015, the Japanese government has aspired for nuclear energy to account for 20 %-22% of 

Japan ’s power supply by 2030. 210 Public opinion on the role of nuclear power in Japan remains 

divisive, however. One 2022 poll suggested that public support for restarting inactive reactors 

reached 53%, the highest level of support since 2011. 211 Russia ’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine 

appears to be shaping debates over nuclear power in Japan, with some arguing that the country 

should expand nuclear power to reduce dependency on Russian fossil fuel imports and others 

arguing that Russia ’s targeting of Ukrainian nuclear facilities demonstrates th e vulnerability and 

danger nuclear reactors present in wartime. 212 U.S. -Japan cooperation on nuclear energy ranges 

from technical collaboration (to extend reactor life and ensure a secure fuel supply, for example) 

to leveraging financial, technical, and comm ercial tools to expand nuclear power capacity 

elsewhere in the Indo -Pacific region. “Fully utilizing existing nuclear power ” is a goal of the U.S -

Japan “CoRe Partnership, ” which aims to address climate change and promote green, sustainable 

global economic growth, according to the White House. 213 

Natural Gas 

Following the “triple disaster ” of 2011, natural gas grew as a share of Japan ’s energy mix . I t

constitutes approximately one -quarter of Japan ’s energy mix. 214 More than 90% of Japan ’s

natural gas consumption comes from liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports. 215

LNG is an area where the United States and Japan claim to have complementary interests. Both 

governments foresee LNG contributing to their respective energy security needs, and the sector 

emerged as a prio rity area of energy cooperation during the Trump and Abe Administrations. 216 A

Clean Energy and Energy Security Initiative established by the two countries in 2022 aims to, 

among other things, promote stable and sufficient energy supply through LNG. 217 Japan w as the 

third -largest destination for U.S. LNG exports in 2021, 218 while the United States is the world ’s

third -largest LNG exporter, set to become the top exporter by 2025. 219 Japanese companies are 

invested in U.S. LNG projects, and Japan is increasing its im ports of U.S. LNG. Since 2016, 

Japan has pursued a strategy of trying to establish itself as a regional LNG trading and pricing 

hub. 220 

# Climate Change 

On climate policy, Tokyo has taken cues on from Washington and shifted its own priorities in 

response to U. S. pressure. 221 During the Obama Administration, Japan and the United States 

cooperated on a wide range of bilateral and multilateral environmental and climate initiatives. 

During the Trump Administration, cooperation shifted away from climate change toward regional 

energy security in service of the two countries ’ shared interest in a “free and open Indo -Pacific. ”

Facing pressure from the Biden Administration, Japan since 2021 has embraced more ambitious 

climate -related targets, and leaders from both countrie s have signaled that cooperation on the 

“climate crisis ” is “a pillar of the U.S. -Japan bilateral partnership. ”222 In 2021, Washington and 

Tokyo announced a “U.S. -Japan Climate Partnership ” to “reinforce ” existing cooperation in 

several “priority areas ” such as climate finance, advanced clean energy technology development, 

and supply chain resilience and diversity “to support energy security and the clean energy 

transition. ”223 

Japan ’s 2021 Nationally Determined Contribution to global climate actions notes that the country 

“aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 46 percent ” by FY 2030 (from 2013 levels) and 

aims to realize carbon neutrality by 2050. 224 Climate Action Tracker, an international research 

consortium that rates countries ’ progress toward the Par is Agreement goal of “holding warming 

well below 2℃, and pursuing efforts to limit warning to 1.5℃,” rated Japan “insufficient ” in 

2021 and 2022, a slight improvement from “highly insufficient ” ratings in previous years. 225

# Japanese Politics 

# The LDP Coalitio n’s Control over the Diet 

Since 2012, the locus of Japanese politics has been centered in the dynamics within Japan ’s ruling 

LDP and its smaller coalition partner, the Komeito party. (The coalition has won every 

parliamentary election since December 2012. Since that time, Japan ’s opposition parties have 

generally struggled to reach double digits in many public opinion polls.) Prime Minister Ki shida ’s

LDP enjoys a dominant position in the Japanese political world. With Komeito, the LDP holds 

nearly two -third s of the seats in the Lower House of Japan ’s Diet and nearly 60% of the seats in 

the Upper House. (See  Figure 6 for a display of major parties ’ strength in Japan ’s parliament.) 

The LDP has been in this position of parliamentary supremacy since former Prime Minister Abe 

led it back into power in Decembe r 2012. Since then, the LDP, in coalition with the Komeito 

party, has won victories in seven consecutive parliamentary elections in July 2013, December 

2014, July 2016, October 2017, July 2019 , October 2021, and July 2022 . The last two wins 

occurred under the leadership of Kishida, whom the LDP selected as party leader in September 

2021. 

Since 1955, the LDP h as ruled Japan for all but about four years. Its most recent, and longest, 

time out of power was in 2009 -2012, when the left -of -center Democratic Part y of Japan (DPJ) 

ruled the country. Japan ’s political stability since 2012 stands in contrast to the turmoil of the 

2007 -2012 period, when t he premiership changed hands six times in those six years, and no party 

controlled both the Lower and Upper Houses o f the parliament for more than a few months. Japan -U.S. Relations: Issues for Congress

The LDP and Its Partner, Komeito, Control the Lower House, Which Elects the Prime Minister. 

Source: Japan’s Lower and Uppe r Houses of the Diet. 

The LDP ’s reliance on Komeito to maintain its political dominance extends beyond the latter 

party ’s crucial Upper House seats, which give the coalition a majority in that chamber. Komeito 

is a political offshoot of the Soka Gakkai Bud dhist movement that is able to mobilize its 

followers into a reliable voter bloc in many electoral districts. According to one estimate, by 2019 

the organization was providing 5% -20% of the votes for each LDP candidate. 226 Komeito ’s

outsized political importance also manifests itself on selected security issues, given Soka 

Gakkai ’s pacifist leanings. Komeito arguably influence d former Prime Minister Abe to water 

down a number of the provisions of his 2014 reforms allowing J apan to participate in collective 

self -defense activities. Komeito ’s more pacifist tendencies also appeared to have complicate d

Abe ’s unsuccessful efforts to revise Japan ’s constitution, particularly its pacifist -oriented Article 

9. Ultimately , Abe was una ble to realize these reforms during his nearly eight years in office .227

Any attempt to change the constitution would have to surmount other formidable political and procedural hurdles. A 

constitutional revision requires a two -thirds vote in each Diet chamber followed by approval in a nationwide 

referendum. Decisions about priorities will also likely take time, because there are calls to amend a number of other 

provisions of the constitution, which was written by the United States during the U.S. occupation of Japan in 1946 and 

has never been chan ged. Furthermore, any constitutional changes passed by the Diet must also be approved by a 

majority in a nationwide referendum, and many opinion polls show the Japanese public to be skeptical about the need Japan -U.S. Relations: Issues for Congress  

> Congressional Research Service 44

Revising the constitution has been a long -standing goal of Japanese conservatives, who have 

come to dominate the LDP. Many of these politicians in the LDP ’s dominant wing are also know n

for advocating nationalist (and in some cases ultra -nationalist ) views that many argue embrace a

revisionist view of Japanese history that rejects the narrative of Imperial Japanese aggression and 

victimization of other Asians in the first half of the 20 th century .228 In contrast, Kishida is 

generally not associated with the LDP ’s nationalist wing and , prior to seeking the premiership in 

2021 , had tended to advocate a more dovish approach to foreign and defense policy matters. 

However, as with many LDP members of parliament, Kishida is a member of Nippon Kaigi 

Kyokai, a group that contends Japan should be applauded for liberating much of East Asia from 

Western colonial powers in the 20 th century , that the 1946 -1948 Tokyo War Crimes tribu nals were 

illegitimate, and that the killings by Imperial Japanese troops during the 1937 “Nanjing massacre ”

were exaggerated or fabricated. 229 

# Japan ’s Main Opposition Parties 

Since 2012, Japan ’s opposition parties have generally struggled to reach double digits in many 

public opinion polls, com pared to over 30% for the LDP. In general, disarray among Japan ’s

opposition parties has arguably contributed to the LDP -Komeito coalition ’s electoral success 

since the center -left DPJ lost power in December 2012. Th e DPJ subsequently split, and one of its 

successor parties, the Constitutional Democratic Party , has been the largest opposition party since 

2019. Another opposition grouping, the center -right Nippon Ishin (Japan Innovation) Party, which 

has strong roots i n the Osaka -Kyoto region, increased its seat total in the July 2022 Upper House 

election. Its members, along with those of the smaller Democratic Party for the People, have 

supported revising the constitution and a more robust defense policy. In the future , they could 

potentially provide the LDP with additional votes to offset the possible loss of Komeito votes on 

those issues. 

Popular Views on Japan ’s Security 

Public opinion polls in Japan reveal a citizenry that is considerably more concerned about threa ts 

to Japan but still reluctant to drastically revise Japan ’s approach to security. In one poll, just over 

one -third of respondents favored increasing defense spending to 2% of GDP, in contrast to the 

enthusiasm among many Japanese politicians. 230 Another po ll showed just over half supporting 

some increase in the defense budget. 231 Further, the LDP ’s coalition partner, the Komeito party, 

has expressed major reservations about shifting to more security activism. 232

Shinzo Abe’s Legacy 

The July 2022 assassination o f former Prime Minister Abe sent shockwaves through Japan and the world. Abe was 

credited with bringing unusual stability to Japanese politics and foreign policy, was known as a key architect of the 

“Free and Open Indo -Pacific” concept —much of which the Un ited States subsequently adopted as its own 

policy —and a champion of the TPP  trade agreement.  After resigning in 2020, he remained politically active, 

pushing for Japan to increase its defense spending, acquire more advanced military capabilities, and take  a more 

assertive stance toward China, especially its threats to Taiwan —all moves widely supported by the United States. 

Abe was a stalwart supporter of the U.S. -Japan alliance who worked closely with Presidents Obama and Trump to 

strengthen the operationa l capabilities of the two militaries and align U.S. and Japanese strategies toward the Indo -

Pacific. Obama and Abe together made historic visits to Hiroshima (where the United States dropped its first 

atomic bomb in 1945) and Pearl Harbor (site of the init ial Japanese attack on the United States in 1941), and in 

2015 Abe became the first Japanese prime minister to address a joint meeting of Congress. Abe developed a close 

rapport with Trump that sustained the relationship despite the U.S. withdrawal from th e TPP, U.S. imposition of 

tariffs on Japanese steel and aluminum on national security grounds, and Trump’s skepticism of alliances. In 2019, 

Trump and Abe completed two limited trade deals covering some goods and digital trade. (The agreements took 

effect  without formal action by Congress. )

Abe’s nationalist views on Japan’s history of colonialism and invasion during the first half of the 20 th  century at 

times generated controversy in Japan and abroad. Abe was associated with groups and promoted individual s to 

important posts who rejected  the narrative of Japanese aggression and victimization of other Asians.  Early in his 

premiership, some observers voiced concern that his leadership could harm U.S. interests in the region by 

inflaming historical tensions.  Examples include a 2013 visit to the controversial Yasukuni Shrine that honors Japan’s 

wartime dead —including several Class A war criminals —and his suggestion that women forced to provide sex to 

Imperial Japanese soldiers were not coerced into the military ’s extensive brothel system. However, Abe generally 

refrained from major diplomatically inflammatory statements and drew praise for his pragmatic foreign policy. 

Japan’s regional standing and influence generally improved, aside from China and South Korea.  During visits to the 

United States and Australia, Abe made speeches expressing regret for World War II. 

# Japan ’s Demographic Challenge 

Japan ’s combination of a low birth rate, strict immigration practices, and a shrinking and rapidly 

aging population presents policymakers with a significant challenge. Polls suggest that Japanese 

women are avoiding marriage and childbearing because of the difficulty of combining career and 

family in Japan : T he fertility rate is 1. 36 , below the 2.1 rate necessary to sust ain population 

size. 233 Japan ’s population growth rate is -0.2%, according to the World Bank, and its current 

population of 126 million is projected to fall to about 102 million by mid century. 234 Concerns 

about a huge shortfall in the labor force have grown, p articularly as the elderly require more care. 

The ratio of working -age persons to retirees is projected to fall from 5:2 around 2010 to 3:2 in 

2040, reducing the resources available to pay for the government social safety net. 235 Japan ’s

immigration policies have traditionally been strictly limited, limiting one potential source of new 

workers. In 2019, the Japanese government introduced a new visa policy aiming to attract
