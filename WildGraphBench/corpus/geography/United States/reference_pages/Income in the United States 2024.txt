Income in the United States: 2024
=================================

 September 09, 2025 

**Report Number:** P60-286 

Written by:

Melissa Kollar and Zach Scherer

Introduction
------------

This report presents estimates on income, earnings, and inequality in the United States for calendar year 2024, based on information collected in the 2025 and earlier Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplements (CPS ASEC) conducted by the Census Bureau.

The income estimates in the main sections of this report are based on the concept of money income, which is pretax and does not account for the value of in-kind transfers. Appendix A provides a detailed explanation of how income is measured using the CPS ASEC. Estimates of post-tax income and inequality are included in Appendix B.

### Highlights

*   Median household income was $83,730 in 2024, not statistically different from the 2023 estimate of $82,690 (Figure 1 and Table A-1).
*   Between 2023 and 2024, median income increased by 5.1 percent for Asian households and 5.5 percent for Hispanic households, while it declined by 3.3 percent for Black households. Median income did not change significantly for White or non-Hispanic White households (Figure 2 and Table A-1).
*   Income inequality as measured by the Gini index was not significantly different between 2023 and 2024 (Figure 3 and Table A-3).
*   Household income at the 90th percentile increased 4.2 percent, but did not change significantly at the 10th and 50th percentiles between 2023 and 2024 (Table A-3).
*   Among full-time, year-round workers, median earnings increased 3.7 percent for men, but did not change significantly for women between 2023 and 2024 (Figure 4 and Table A-6).
*   For full-time, year-round workers, the female-to-male earnings ratio in 2024 fell to 80.9 percent from 82.7 percent in 2023 (Figure 5 and Table A-7). This is the second consecutive annual decrease in the female-to-male earnings ratio.

### For More Information

To adjust for changes in the cost of living over time, historical income and earnings estimates in this report are expressed in real or 2024 dollars. The current method for inflation-adjustment is based on the[Chained Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (C-CPI-U)](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/additional-resources/chained-cpi.htm)between 2000 and 2024[](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2025/demo/p60-286.html)and the[Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers Retroactive Series (R-CPI-U-RS)](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/research-series/r-cpi-u-rs-home.htm)prior to 2000. More information on the inflation adjustment and the annual index values are available in Appendix A.
