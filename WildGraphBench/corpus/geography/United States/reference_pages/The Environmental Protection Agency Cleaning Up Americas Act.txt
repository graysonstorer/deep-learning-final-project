Bloomsbury Academic, 2006 - [Law](https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=subject:%22Law%22&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0) - 385 pages

The Environmental Protection Agency is a young and dynamic federal agency facing the challenges of modern environmental protection. The political controversies and social impacts of the agency are immense, involving courts, legislatures, and elected officials, and the effects of its actions are far reaching, affecting every single person in the United States.

After a brief history of the agency, chapters describe its organization, programs, controversies, key events, notable people, and impact on society. Topics covered include the _Exxon Valdez_ oil spill, Three Mile Island, and The Clean Air Act, as well as biographies on administrators Carol Browner, William Ruckelhaus, and Anne M. Gorsuch.
