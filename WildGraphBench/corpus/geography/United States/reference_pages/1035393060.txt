First peoples : a documentary survey of American Indian history
===============================================================

Author: [Colin G. Calloway](https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=au=%22Calloway%2C%20Colin%20G.%22) (Author)

Summary: "First Peoples' hallmark approach to American Indian history continues to make it the best-selling and most respected text for the American Indian history survey, while Colin G. Calloway provides timely scholarship and a narrative that brings a largely untold history to students. The signature format of First Peoples strikes the ideal balance, combining in every chapter a compelling narrative and, through its documents and picture essay sections, rich written and visual documents from Native and non-Native voices alike. The new edition includes more pedagogical support for students with a conclusion and chapter review in every chapter"--Back cover
