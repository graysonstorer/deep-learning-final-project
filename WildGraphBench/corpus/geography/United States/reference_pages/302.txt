Dear readers:

If you can, please help the Legal Information Institute [LII]. Donor support is very important to us. If everyone reading today donated the price of their morning cup of coffee, we would meet our fundraising goal for the entire campaign. We're a small operation with costs of a top website: servers, staff and programs. We serve millions of readers, but we run on a fraction of what other top sites spend. If the LII is useful to you, please take one minute to show your support. _Thank you._
