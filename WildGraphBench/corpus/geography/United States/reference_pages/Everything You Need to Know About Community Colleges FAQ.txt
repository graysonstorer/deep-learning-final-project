Commu n ity Colleges vs. Four-Year Colleges
-------------------------------------------

Community colleges are primarily public higher education institutions that strive to provide affordable, shorter-term education that's accessible to all.

An associate degree, which takes about two years full time to complete, is usually the highest degree available, but community college students can also receive certificates and job training. Many students begin their postsecondary studies at [community colleges](https://www.usnews.com/education/community-colleges) before transferring to a four-year institution to pursue a bachelor's degree.

"In addition to transfer degrees, many community colleges provide career and technical programs that lead directly to in-demand jobs, allowing students to gain skills and enter the workforce quickly," Bobbi Stannard, assistant dean of student access and outreach at the [College of Southern Idaho](https://www.usnews.com/education/community-colleges/college-of-southern-idaho-CC01740), wrote in an email.

### How Are Community Colleges Different From Four-Year Colleges and Universities?

The types of degrees offered is one of the main differences between community colleges and four-year colleges and universities, experts say.

Four-year colleges and universities award bachelor's degrees. Many also award graduate and doctoral degrees, and most have more selective admissions than community colleges. Almost all community colleges are open access, which means almost anyone who applies is accepted.

Small class sizes, affordability, convenience and faculty who are focused on teaching– as opposed to research –are often cited as the main benefits of attending a community college, experts say.

"All of our community colleges fit their communities in terms of the complexion and the offerings that are available to them," says Jee Hang Lee, president and CEO of the Association of Community College Trustees. "So many of our workforce-based programs are aligned with the business and local needs. Our institutions really try to support our students and highlight those programs because those are the programs that our business partners need."

### What Types of Jobs Are Available to Community College Graduates?

The most popular associate degrees for community college graduates include liberal arts and sciences, general studies, and humanities, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Some of the fast-growing careers for people with associate degrees are physical therapist assistants, [dental hygienists](https://www.usnews.com/education/community-colleges/articles/2015/02/06/frequently-asked-questions-community-college), and radiologic and MRI technologists, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics projections for 2024 to 2034.

**Applying to Community Colleges**
----------------------------------

### Do I Have to Apply for Admission to Attend a Community College?

Students may have to submit an application, but most community colleges have open admissions policies. This means that any student with a high school diploma or GED can attend and typically doesn't have to fulfill academic requirements or submit [SAT or ACT](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/act-vs-sat-how-to-decide-which-test-to-take) scores to compete with others for admission.

However, there may be selective admissions to certain high-demand programs such as nursing, experts say. If a student doesn't qualify for a specific program, there are generally other options.

Community colleges usually review and admit applicants [year-round](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2018-01-11/rolling-admissions-10-frequently-asked-questions).

### Can I Attend a Community College While Still in High School?

Most high school students can take college courses at a community college, usually within a [dual enrollment program](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/how-to-earn-college-credit-through-dual-enrollment "Link: https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2012/03/09/some-teens-start-college-work-early-via-dual-enrollment") or a high school [early college program](https://www.usnews.com/education/k12/articles/early-college-programs-what-to-know). In these programs, high school students take community college courses and receive both high school and college credits. Sometimes these courses are held at the student's high school.

Students must meet certain GPA or placement requirements; obtain approval from a high school counselor and parent or guardian; and submit a college application to participate in a dual enrollment program, Kristen Carter, associate director of dual enrollment at [Northern Virginia Community College](https://www.usnews.com/education/community-colleges/northern-virginia-community-college-CC06263), wrote in an email.

"These courses offer valuable benefits, including students saving time and money, gaining exposure to college expectations and rigor, and strengthening future college applications. These credits often transfer to colleges and universities after graduation. Dual enrollment opens doors for students by giving them the confidence and early exposure to college expectations that prepares them for success long before high school graduation."

### Do I Need to Take Placement Tests to Register for Community College Courses?

Community colleges are moving away from traditional standardized tests a n d instead are using multiple measures assessment systems, such as GPA, says Mark Mannheimer, assistant director of student success initiatives at Northern Virginia Community College.

"Most new students at NOVA do not need to take a traditional placement test for math and English," Mannheimer says. "Instead, they fill out a direct enrollment survey to be placed based on factors like their high school GPA and coursework. However, some groups – including military students using tuition assistance and veteran affairs benefits, dual enrollment students taking specific courses and students who graduated more than five years ago without prior college credit – may still need to take the Virginia Placement Test."

### Can I Attend a Community College Outside of My Hometown or State?

Students can attend a community college in another state. However, some districts charge higher tuition to out-of-district and out-of-state students. The average in-district tuition and fees for full-time students at public two-year colleges ranged from $1,430 in California to $8,660 in Vermont in 2022-2023, according to the College Board.

"There may be a program in a different state that someone's interested in," says Martha M. Parham, public relations senior vice president at the American Association of Community Colleges. "They are also a very valid pathway to a four-year university. So if there's a university you really want to go to, there may be a community college closer to that university that has a transfer pathway. So we'll see students doing that. But for the majority of students, they tend to stay in the local area."

### Is It Easy to Transfer to a Four-Year College or University From a Community College?

The ease of [transferring](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/2017-09-22/transferring-colleges-10-frequently-asked-questions) from a community college to a four-year college or university varies greatly based on many factors, including the state of residence, educational institutions involved and a student's intended major, experts say.

Students can take advantage of articulation agreements, which generally confirm that the credits earned at one institution will apply at another.

"Many community colleges have strong partnerships with four-year institutions and offer clear transfer pathways to make the process seamless," Stannard says. "Students are encouraged to meet with academic or faculty advisers early to plan their courses and ensure they are on track. Most community college classes transfer smoothly, but working with an adviser helps students choose the right courses and avoid surprises when they're ready to make the move."

**Academics at Community College**
----------------------------------

### What Kinds of Credentials Can Be Earned at a Community College?

Community colleges typically award associate degrees, which usually take about two years to complete full time.

There are mainly three types: Associate of Arts, Associate of Science and Associate of Applied Science. The first two are often used as a pathway to a bachelor's degree and are considered condensed versions of bachelor's degree programs, as they include a mix of general education requirements and elective courses.

Workers with only a high school diploma earn a weekly median wage of $930, while workers with an associate degree earn a median of $1,099 per week, according to BLS [data](https://www.bls.gov/emp/chart-unemployment-earnings-education.htm) for 2024. Average weekly earnings jump to $1,543 for bachelor's degree-holders.

Community colleges also award postsecondary certificates, which can take a few months to several years to complete.

Most [certificate programs](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/what-is-a-certificate-program) are highly focused on a specific field and are geared toward particular occupations, similar to associate of applied science degrees. Occupations projected to see much faster than average growth from 2024 to 2034 and that require only a certificate include wind turbine technicians; heating, air conditioning and refrigeration installers and mechanics; and massage therapists, according to the BLS.

Postsecondary certificates are earned for college credit and the courses could eventually be applied toward graduation requirements in a formal degree program, such as an associate degree.

Community colleges that offer bachelor's degrees are uncommon but growing. More than 200 two-year colleges in 24 states grant bachelor's degrees, according to the Community College Baccalaureate Association.

### What's the Difference Between Credit and Noncredit Classes?

Classes that are taken for credit count toward graduation requirements in an accredited program of study, such as in an associate degree program, experts say.

Noncredit classes don't count toward graduation requirements. These courses are generally for learning new skills or earning certifications and don't qualify for federal financial aid.

"Those are what we call the career and technical education programs," Parham says. "They are, by design, created so that students have an opportunity to gain the skills they need to be employable in the local job market. And even quite frankly, the global job market, because we're seeing a lot of AI and IT and those classes that kind of translate location."

Students who enroll in noncredit programs that offer job-focused, short-term training experience higher earnings and are more likely to be employed after training completion compared to their unenrolled peers, according to a 2025 [study](https://www.aera.net/Newsroom/Labor-Market-Returns-to-Community-College-Noncredit-Occupational-Education?utm_source=Informz&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=test) published by the American Educational Research Association.

### Do Community Colleges Offer Flexible Courses?

Community colleges typically offer in-person and [online classes](https://www.usnews.com/higher-education/online-education/articles/how-online-classes-work-frequently-asked-questions), the latter offering benefits such as convenience and affordability.

Students can also take night or weekend classes at many community colleges, but those are more limited in number, experts say.

"They offer the same types of flexibility that I think all of higher education really does in our post-COVID world," Parham says. "They have online options, they have hybrid options, there are cohort models, there are individual study models. Community colleges are looking at meeting students where they are, so they tend to offer even more flexibility than other types of higher education."

### Do International Students Attend Community Colleges?

Nearly 64,000 [international students](https://www.usnews.com/education/community-colleges/slideshows/community-colleges-with-the-most-international-students) attended U.S. community colleges during the 2024-2025 school year, a 7.8% increase from the year prior, according to [data](https://opendoorsdata.org/data/international-students/enrollment-by-institutional-type/) from the Institute of International Education. This represents slightly over 5% of all international student enrollment at U.S. colleges during that time.

"A lot of international students that come to the nation's community colleges are looking for programs in specific locations," Parham says. There are more than 1,000 U.S. community colleges, so "that really provides them the most flexibility to be in the location of their choosing. We also see that they tend to come to community colleges in order to transfer to other universities. It provides them with a greater number of options as they consider education in the United States."

Most community colleges have a variety of [student clubs](https://www.usnews.com/education/articles/how-college-clubs-can-lead-to-careers) and organizations that allow students to socialize with their peers.

Many offer athletic opportunities, too. Dozens of community colleges compete against one another in sports and are members of the National Junior College Athletic Association. Early in their history, community colleges were called junior colleges.

Extracurriculars "are wonderful opportunities for students to increase their knowledge base and really get more involved in their student community," Lee says. "It does have that campus feel that many students desire as part of their student experience."

### What Type of Campus Services Do Community Colleges Provide Students?

Specific service offerings vary per school, but students should expect the same campus services they would from any other type of higher education institution, Parham says.

"Community colleges offer a wide range of resources that support both academic and personal success," Stannard says. "Students may have access to tutoring, counseling, career services, food services, transportation assistance, fitness centers and more. ... Community colleges provide flexible options, supportive environments and endless opportunities – making them a strong starting place for many students."

### Do Community Colleges Have Student Housi n g?

Most community colleges are commuter schools and don't have [housing](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/what-to-know-about-choosing-between-housing-on-or-off-campus) for students. However, that has been changing in recent decades, and about 28% of public community colleges now provide on-campus housing, according to an AACC analysis.

**Cost and Financial Aid at Community Colleges**
------------------------------------------------

### How Do Community College Costs Compare With Four-Year Colleges and Universities?

Community colleges tend to be considerably cheaper than four-year colleges and universities.

At public four-year colleges in 2025-2026, the average in-state [tuition](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/what-you-need-to-know-about-college-tuition-costs) and fees for full-time undergraduate students were $11,950 while tuition and fees for their out-of-state counterparts were $31,880, according to the College Board's 2025 Trends in College Pricing [report](https://research.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/Trends-in-College-Pricing-and-Student-Aid-2025-final_1.pdf). Comparatively, the average in-district tuition and fees for full-time students at public two-year colleges in the same year were $4,150.

### Do Community College Students Qualify for Financial Aid?

Sixty-seven percent of community college students received a financial aid offer for the 2024-2025 academic year, according to the annual Sallie Mae/Ipsos survey "[How America Pays for College](https://www.salliemae.com/content/dam/slm/writtencontent/Research/HAP_2025.pdf)."

In most cases, the same kind of financial aid available to students at four-year institutions is available at community colleges. The federal [Pell Grant](https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/paying-for-college/articles/everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-pell-grant), federal student loans, state assistance and institutional aid are among the most common forms of financial aid that community college students receive. Local [scholarships](https://www.usnews.com/education/scholarships/search) are another source of aid.

"Some colleges also offer emergency funds or additional support programs to help students through unexpected financial challenges," Stannard says.
