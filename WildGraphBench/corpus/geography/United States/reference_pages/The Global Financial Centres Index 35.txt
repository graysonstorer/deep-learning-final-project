The Global Financial Centres Index 35
=====================================

The thirty-fifth edition of the Global Financial Centres Index (GFCI 35) was published on 21 March 2024. GFCI 35 provides evaluations of future competitiveness and rankings for 121 financial centres around the world. The GFCI serves as a valuable reference for policy and investment decision-makers.

China Development Institute (CDI) in Shenzhen and Z/Yen Partners in London collaborate in producing the GFCI. The GFCI is updated and published every March and September, and receives considerable attention from the global financial community.

133 financial centres were researched for GFCI 35 of which 121 are in the main index. The GFCI is compiled using 145 instrumental factors. These quantitative measures are provided by third parties including the World Bank, the Economist Intelligence Unit, the OECD and the United Nations.

The instrumental factors are combined with financial centre assessments provided by respondents to the GFCI online questionnaire. GFCI 35 uses 48,365 assessments from 8,494 respondents.
