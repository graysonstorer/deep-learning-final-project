**The 5 Best Countries for Education**
--------------------------------------

Education is one of the most important services a country can offer to its citizens and to international students who come to study. And the reputations of some nations’ educational systems are especially strong, according to a global survey.

A companion to the overall [2024 Best Countries rankings](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries) from U.S. News, the 2024 Best Countries for Education rankings are drawn from an [international survey](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/articles/methodology) of nearly 17,000 people and highlight nations according to respondents’ perceptions of them in three areas. Those include whether a country has a [well-developed public education system](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-countries/rankings/well-developed-public-education-system), whether respondents would consider attending university there and if that country has a reputation for top-quality universities.

In Germany, the birthplace of the [concept](https://germanculture.com.ua/famous-germans/who-invented-kindergarten/) of kindergarten, most students [between the ages of 3 and 6](https://www.expatica.com/de/living/family/daycares-and-preschools-in-germany-107640/#Types) attend class at that level, though some schools accept children under 3. Compulsory school attendance begins at age 6.

Primary school typically lasts for four grades, after which most students follow [various tracks of secondary education](https://the-red-relocators.com/relocation-guides-germany/children-in-germany/german-school-system/), such as the Hauptschule, or general school, which provides basic secondary education and often a path to [vocational training](https://www.studying-in-germany.org/german-education-system/). A Gymnasium school, meanwhile, is geared toward [university enrollment](https://the-red-relocators.com/relocation-guides-germany/children-in-germany/german-school-system/#secondary).

German students scored [slightly above the OECD average](https://gpseducation.oecd.org/CountryProfile?primaryCountry=DEU&treshold=10&topic=PI) in all three domains of reading, math and science on the OECD’s Program for International Student Assessment in 2022.
