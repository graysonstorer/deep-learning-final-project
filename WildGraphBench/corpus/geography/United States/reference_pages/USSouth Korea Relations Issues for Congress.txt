> Congressional Research Service

# Summary 

Overview 

South Korea (officially the Republic of Korea or ROK) is one of the United States ’ most 

important strategic and economic partners in Asia. The 1953 U.S. -ROK Mutual Defense Treaty 

commits the United States to help South Korea defend itself. Approximately 28,500 U.S. troops 

are based in the ROK, which is included under the U.S. “nuclear umbrella. ” The two countries ’

economies are join ed by the Korea -U.S. Free Trade Agreement (KORUS FTA). South Korea is 

the United States ’ seventh -largest trading partner and the United States is South Korea ’s second -

largest trading partner . South Korean President Moon Jae -in, a left -of -center politician elected in 

2017, is due to leave office in May 2022. 

In recent years, Members of Congress have expressed interest in and conducted oversight over 

U.S. -ROK cooperation over North Korea policy, the U.S. military presence in South Korea, 

bilateral trade and investment flows, the state of political and civil rights in South Korea , and 

other issues . South Korea ’s rise into the ranks of the world ’s top industrialized economies and 

most powerful militaries has prompted many Members to explore whether and how the ROK 

government, companies, and organizations can serve as par tners in many U.S. Indo -Pacific 

initiatives , particularly on those that involve the People ’s Republic of China (PRC , or China ).

ROK officials generally are reluctant to raise objections about PRC behavior that do es not 

directly affect South Korea , though this may be changing due to rising negative attitudes towards 

China among South Koreans. 

Coordination of North Korea Policy 

Dealing with North Korea (officially the Democratic People ’s Republic o f Korea, or DPRK) is 

the domin ant bilateral strategic concern and the Biden and Moon governments have worked to 

harmonize their approaches and minimize public disagreements . The Biden Administration 

policy , which Moon has welcomed, appears to envision incr ementally offering partial sanctions 

relief in exchange for partial steps toward denuclearization. During his tenure, Moon has more 

aggressively promoted engagement initiatives with the DPRK , which he says are critical to 

prevent military conflict and esta blish a durable peace on the Korean Peninsula. U.N. and U.S. 

sanctions , which have reduced DPRK exports by around 90%, severely limit Seoul ’s ability to 

conduct inter -Korean cooperation activities. Since early 2019, the DPRK largely has ignored U.S. 

and ROK outreach, including offers of humanitarian aid .

The U.S. -ROK Alliance 

For nearly two decades , the United States and South Korea have accelerated steps to reform their 

alliance , including relocating U.S. troops on the Korean Peninsula , boosting ROK defense 

capabilities , and preparing to transfer wartime operational control (OPCON) to a binational 

command led by an ROK ge neral with a U.S. deputy. Under the existing arrangement, South 

Korean soldiers would be under a binational command led by a U.S. general in the event of war. 

Many of President Donald Trump ’s actions and words strained the alliance, and the Biden 

Administr ation in its first year in office sought to repair the rifts, particularly by renewing an

agreement on sharing the costs of South Korea hosting U.S. troops that had expired under the 

Trump Administration . Polls in recent years indicate over 85% of South Ko reans say they value 

the U.S. -ROK alliance. 

Bilateral Economic Relations 

The KORUS FTA has been the centerpiece of U.S. -South Korea trade and investment relations 

since its entry into force in 2012. Most U.S. business groups support the agreement, highlig hting U.S. -South Korea Relations 

> Congressional Research Service

market access improvements in South Korea and a more robust mechanism for dispute resolution, 

but some U.S. stakeholders have raised concerns over an increase in the bilateral U.S. trade 

deficit since the agreement took effect. The two countries cont inue to engage on KORUS FTA 

implementation issues using the agreement ’s consultative mechanisms. Bilateral trade frictions 

have been less pronounced under President Biden than under the Trump Administration, in line 

with the Biden Administration ’s interest in working with allies to address global economic 

challenges and ensure greater U.S. supply chain security and reliability. However, President 

Biden has maintained several u nilateral U.S. import restrictions affecting major South Korean 

industries, such a s steel, washing machines, and solar panels, which were imposed by President 

Trump using trade authorities delegated by Congress. U.S. -South Korea Relations

# Recent Developments and Upcoming Events 

# Possible Opportunities for Congress to Influence U.S. -ROK 

# Relations 

Over the past decade, congressional interest in U.S. rela tions with South Korea (officially the 

Republic of Korea or ROK) primarily has been focused on issues concerning U.S. -ROK 

cooperation over North Korea policy, the U.S. -ROK alliance, and U.S. -South Korea trade and 

investment flows. Additionally, South Korea ’s rise into the ranks of the world ’s top industrialized 

economies and most powerful militaries has prompted many Members to explore whether and 

how the ROK government, companies, and organizations can serve as partners in many U.S. 

Indo -Pacific initiative s, particularly on those that involve the People ’s Republic of China (PRC, 

or China). In 2021 and 2022 , as shown in the “Legislation in the 117 th Congress ” section below, 

some Members also expressed interest in immigration from South Korea and in the state of South 

Korea ’s political and civil rights situation. 

A number of expected or routine events and legislative vehicles in 2022 could present 

opportunities for Members to seek to influence or address U.S. -South Korea relations: 

 The Biden Administration has made a selection for U.S. ambassador to Seoul, a post that 

has been vacant since Januar y 2021. This development would provide the Senate with an 

opportunity to review U.S. policies toward the Korean Peninsula. 1

 In March or April of each year, the Armed Services Committees in both chambers 

generally hold hearings with theater combatant comma nders, including the Commander 

of U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) , that provide opportunities to discuss alliance issues such 

as U.S. and South Korean militaries ’ state of readiness, the implementation of the 

transition of wartime operational control to South Kor ea, and the impact the relocation of 

U.S. headquarters from downtown Seoul to a site an hour south of the city has had on 

alliance coordination. 

 South Korea is scheduled to hold a presidential election on March 9, 2022, and the new 

president is to be inau gurated on May 10. In the past, Members have attended South 

Korean presidential inaugurations . E arly outreach to a new South Korean President and 

his or her team would offer an opportunity to collaborate on next steps on North Korea 

policy and on approache s to the Indo -Pacific region. President Biden reportedly is 

considering traveling to Seoul to attend the event , a trip that may also include a stop in 

Japan to hold a bilateral summit there and to meet with the three other members of the

Quadrilateral Se cu rity Dialogue, also known as “the Quad. ”2 The President ’s trip, if it 

occurs, could provide Members with an opportunity to express their views on various 

items in the U.S. -South K orea relationship. 

 The launch of a new ROK presidential administration also could provide an opportunity 

for Members to encourage South Korea and Japan to improve their relationship, which 

has been highly strained since 2018. In the past, Congress has passed resolutions that 

encourage greater trilateral cooperation among the Unite d States, South Korea, and 

Japan, underscoring the value of the two allies working together. During official travel 

and other engagement with South Korea officials, some Members have emphasized this 

importance to their Japanese and South Korean interlocuto rs. Some Members have also 

engaged in trilateral legislative exchanges, which could be enhanced in order to 

encourage more coordination. 

 Annual authori zation and appropriations bills, including the National Defense 

Authorization Act (NDAA), State Departmen t-Foreign Operations 

Appropriations bill , Military Construction -Veterans Affairs (VA) Appropriations 

bill, and any hearings surrounding these measures provide opportunities for 

congressional involvement in and oversight of U.S. -ROK relations , particularly 

on issues related to North Korea policy coordination and the U.S. -ROK alliance .

 In February 2022, the Biden Administration released its Indo -Pacific strategy. 

Key components of the approach are pursuing “unprecedented cooperation ” with 

U.S. allies and part ners, including South Korea , and “moderniz[ing] ” U.S. 

alliance relations . Additionally, o ne of the strategy ’s ten “core lines of effort ” is 

encouraging South Korea and Japan to increase their cooperation. 3 Later in 2022, 

the Administration is expected to r elease its national security strategy. These 

documents are likely to have implications for U.S. -South Korea relations that 

Members may seek to incorporate into their oversight. 

 The Biden Administration has stated it plans to begin negotiations on an Indo -

Pacific Economic Framework initiative in early 2022, which may include South 

Korea. 4 Congress, given its constitutional authority to regulate foreign 

commerce, may consider how to ensure its trade and economic priorities are 

reflected in these negotiations, and the extent to which congressional approval of 

the framework is required under U.S. law. 

# Biden and Moon ’s May 2021 Summit 

In May 2021, Biden and Moon Jae -in met in Washington, DC. The meeting, Biden ’s second in -

person summit after one with Japan ’s prime minister, was one of several early signal s that the 

Administration was placing a priority on the Indo -Pacific region and on reinvigorating U.S. 

alliances. 5 U.S. -ROK p olicy under the administrations of Donald Trump and Moon featur ed

cooperation but also tensions over North Korea policy, sharing the costs of the U.S. -ROK 

alliance, and trade that strained the relationship , prompting the 115 th and 116 th Congresses to take 

legislative and oversight actions . (See the “Security Relations and the U.S. -ROK Alliance ”

section bel ow.) In 2021, Biden and Moon took steps to restore and reinvigorate the relationship. 

In the weeks prior to Moon ’s May 2021 visit, the two governments removed a major area of 

tension by concluding a new five -year agreement to share the costs of hosting U.S . troops in 

South Korea. South Korea agreed to raise its contribution by nearly 14% compared to the 

previous agreement that had expired over a year earlier . (For more, see the “Cost Sharing ” section 

below .) 

The Biden -Moon summit was widely interpreted in the United States and South Korea as 

restoring the health of the alliance and expanding the aperture of the relationship to focus more 

directly and more often on cooperating on global and regional issues. 6 During their summit, 

Biden and Moon discussed North Korea policy, terminated an agreement that had restricted ROK 

ballistic miss ile development , and stated their shared values on many issues pertaining to China, 

including the first -ever mention of Taiwan in a U.S. -ROK leaders ’ joint statement. Biden and 

Moon also announced :

 a Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) vaccine partnership ;

 a U.S. pledge to vaccinate 550,000 South Korean troops (increased to 1 million 

after the summit) who work closely with U.S. military forces; 

 investments in the United States by ROK technology companies in key sectors; 

 a South Korean pledge of $220 mil lion in aid to Northern Triangle Central 

American countries to help resolve U.S. inward migration challenges ; and 

 expanded cooperation on critical technologies, climate change, energy, cyber -

security, nuclear energy, global health, and space. 7

Moon also met with several Members of Congress , participated in the groundbreaking for a new 

feature at the Korean War Memorial on the National Mall, and participated in Biden ’s awarding 

of the National Medal of Honor to an American Korean War veteran .

# North Korea Policy Coordination 

North Korea is the dominant strategic concern in the U.S. -South Korea relationship . Moon has 

championed U.S. -North Korea talks, which he views as critical to preventing military conflict and 

to realizing his goal of establishing a durable peace on the Korean Peninsula. 9 Since early 2019, 

Pyongyang largely has ignored U.S. and South Korea n outreach, including offers of humanitarian 

assistance, and has severed all overt inter -Korean communication channels for extended periods. 

South Korea ’s room for maneuver with North Korea policy is constricted by U.N. and U.S. 

sanctions , which not only b ar most North Korea n exports and many imports, but also require that 

South Korea obtain a waiver from the United States for many of the cooperation activities the 

Moon government favors. 

The Biden Administration has stated it will pursue a “calibrated, practical approach that is open to 

and will explore diplomacy with North Korea ” to “make step -by -step p rogress toward 

denuclearization ” even as U.S. and international sanctions remain in place. 10 The approach 

appears to envision an incrementa l process of offering partial sanctions relief in exchange for 

partial steps toward denuclearization. Administration officials say they have reached out to North 

Korea, offering to meet “without preconditions ,” and that “the ball is in [Pyongyang ’s] court. ”11

The purchasing power parity method of calculating GDP accounts for how much people can buy for their money in a 

given country. Instead of simply measuring total output, the PPP GDP method attempts to gau ge how much a person 

would have to pay in the local currency for a set basket of goods. That amount is then converted to the equivalent value 

in U.S. dollars, so that analysts can make cross -country standard of living comparisons.

Incremental sanctions relief could be difficult to accomplish without congressional support, given 

limitations enacted into law under the past three Congresses. 12 

To implement his policy, Biden has appointed the U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia, Sung Kim, to 

serve concurrently as special representative for North Korea , a position he also occupied during 

the Obama Administration from 2014 - 2016 . From 2011 - 2014, Ambassador Kim served as U.S. 

Ambassador to South Korea. Ambassador Kim has stated that his top p riority “is to collaborate 

closely with my ROK counterparts ” on North Korea ’s denuclearization. 13 

Since January 2021, the United States and South Korea generally have avoided the public 

surfacing of differences over North Korea policy that occurred under th e Trump Administration. 

(See “North Korea Policy Coordination under Obama and Trump .”) Moon has welcomed the 

Biden policy, arguing that it shows an openne ss for U.S. -DPRK dialogue. Biden has supported 

inter -Korean dialogue, and has said that 2018 U.S. -North Korea and South Korea -North Korea 

agreements negotiated by Moon and former President Donald Trump could form the basis for 

denuclearization and achievin g “permanent peace ” on the Korean Peninsula. 14 

As of mid -February 2022 , North Korea has rejected U.S. offers to meet U.S. diplomats. DPRK 

leader Kim Jong -un has characterized U.S. offers of diplomacy as “no more than a petty trick for 

deceiving the international communi ty and hiding its hostile acts, ” specifically the continuation of 

U.S. -ROK military exercises, the maintenance of sanctions against North Korea, and South 

Korean acquisition of and advances in indigenous sophisticated military equipmen t. 15 North 

Korea also generally has ignored South Korean offers of aid, cooperation, and diplomatic 

engagement. Perhaps in reaction to the ongoing stasis in U.S. -DPRK and ROK -DPRK diplomacy 

as Moon approaches his May 2022 departure from office , in the late summer and early fall of 

2021 Moon government officials began emphasizing their preference for pre -emptively offering a 

declaration formally ending the Korean War , which Moon argues will “help us start negotiations 

for denuclearisation and the peace in [si c] the Korean Peninsula. ”16 Some Members of Congress 

have supported pre -emptively issuing such an end -of -war declaration (see H.R. 3446 in the 

Legislation section below), while other s have opposed doing so in the absence of comprehensive 

negotiations with North Korea .17 Among Moon ’s other efforts is an attempt to promote reunions 

among South Korean and North Korean family members who have been divided since the Korean 

War. In 2021, by a 415 -0 vote, the House passed t he Korean War Divided Families Reunification 

Act (H.R. 826 ), which would require the State Department to report to Congress on consultations 

with Sout h Korea on potential opportunities to reunite Korean Americans with family in North 

Korea. 

North Korea has continued to conduct cyber operations around the globe and to test short - and 

medium -range missiles. In September and October 2021, for example, North Korea test -launched 

three new missiles (long -range cruise missiles, short -range ballistic missiles launched from a 

train, and a hypersonic glide missile) and claimed it had developed a quicker fueling system. It

also test -launched what the South Kore an military described as a submarine -launched ballistic 

missile. 18 In January 2022, North Korea conducted seven missile tests, including two it claimed 

demonstrated a new hypersonic glide vehicle that may be nuclear -capable. 19 Some analysts say 

that if these claims are true, these new capabilities would make North Korean missiles more 

difficult to detect and more adept at evading missile defenses. 20 Some analysts worry DPRK 

leader Kim Jong -un will abandon his four -year -old unilateral moratorium on nuclear test s and 

long -range ballistic missile tests. 21 

# South Korea ’s Response to Russia ’s Invasion of Ukraine 

On February 24, 2022, following Russia ’s invasion of Ukraine, South Korea ’s National Security 

Council (NSC) reportedly “expressed strong regret ” over Russia ’s actions and said “the 

government has no other option but to join sanctions against Russia, including export controls .” 

Multiple media outlets said the NSC statement linked ROK sanctions to Russia proceeding to 

launch “a full -fledged war .” 22 South Korea ’s r esponse to Russia ’s actions , which in the build -up 

to the invasion many described as “cautious ,” is likely to be tempered by Seoul ’s strategic and 

economic interests. 23 Since the late 1980s, South Korean leaders have cultivated positive ties with 

Russia (an d the Soviet Union before it) as a way to promote their strategic objectives, particularly 

toward North Korea. 24 Russia ’s veto power on the United Nations Security Council and its 

longstanding diplomatic and economic ties to Pyongyang provide it with opport unities to 

influence North Korea -related developments. Russo -ROK economic ties may also play a role in 

the Moon government ’s calculations. As South Korea ’s ninth -largest trading partner, Russia is an 

important source of South Korea ’s energy imports and is an economic gateway to Eurasia. 25 

Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors together are Russia ’s top -selling automotive brands, and 

Hyundai Motors, Samsung Electronics, and LG Electronics have factories in Russia. 26 South 

Korea did not impose sanctions on Russia follow ing its 2014 seizure of the Crimean Peninsula.

# Economic Ties: Bilateral Supply Chain Partnership Announced as 

# U.S. Import Restrictions Remain 

The Biden Administration has stated its interest in working more with South Korea, and other 

U.S. allies, to addr ess global economic challenges, including as part of its supply chain security 

initiatives. At the May 2021 U.S. -ROK bilateral summit, the two countries announced plans to 

pursue greater cooperation on supply chain issues related to key industries, includi ng electric 

vehicle batteries, semiconductors, and artificial intelligence. 27 South Korean companies also 

announced promises of $25 billion in future U.S. investment in these industries. 

To date, however, the Biden Administration ’s economic policy has focused largely on domestic 

issues and pandemic recovery . In addition, the Administration has maintained (and in one case 

extended) Trump -era import restrictions on certain South Korean imports, a result of action under 

trade authorities (Section 201 and S ection 232 ) delegated by Congress in U.S. trade laws .

Congress may consider whether these import restrictions reflect congressional intent under the 

delegated trade authorities and if such authorities would b enefit from reform . A WTO panel ruled 

in early 2 022 , in response to a South Korean dispute initiated in 2018, that some aspects of the 

U.S. Section 201 import restrictions on washing machines violate WTO commitme nts . It is 

unclear how the Biden and Moon Administrations may seek to resolve the dispute. (See “U.S. 

Section 201 and 232 Import Restrictions Affecting South Korea .”) 

In late 2021, during a visit to South Korea, United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai 

noted the Administration ’s plans for an economic framework agreement in the Indo -Pacific 

region that could potentially include South Korea. 28 It is unclear what form the agreement may 

take, how it may relate to existing South Korea -U.S. Free Trade Agreement ( KORUS FTA )

commitments , and whether it would require congressional approval .29 Some U.S. stakeholders, 

including several Members of Congress, have urged the Administration to focus on establishing 

regional rules on digital trade issues , inc luding during a hearing on the issue in January .30 The 

KORUS FTA ’s digital trade commitments have not been modified since they were originally 

negotiated in the mid -2000 ’s and are less extensive than more recent digital trade disciplines 

negotiated by the U nited States, such as in the U.S. -Mexico -Canada Agreement (USMCA). 31 

# South Korea ’s March 2022 Presidential Election 

The outcome of South Korea ’s March 9 presidential election could shape the extent to which 

Washington, DC and Seoul align on North Korea, China , and on a range of other issues that 

concern many Members of Congress. 32 Moon, elected in 2017, is ineligible to run again because

the ROK constitution limits presidents to one five -year term . Moon belongs to the left -of -center 

Minjoo (Democratic) Par ty, which holds a commanding majority in South Korea ’s unicameral 

National Assembly over the right -of -center People Power Party (PPP) and other opposition 

groups. (See  Figure 1.) Moon ’s popularity fell markedly in 2021, however, to below 30% in 

some polls , due to complaints about soaring housing prices as well as about rising income 

inequality. 33 (For more, see “Increasing Housing Costs and Widening Inequality ” below.) 

Although South Korea ’s two main parties support the ROK -U.S. alliance, they have notably 

different views on how to approach North Korea, Chi na, and Japan. In general, compared to their 

conservative counterparts, Minjoo politicians often advocate for South Korea achieving greater 

strategic autonomy, for more conciliatory approaches to North Korea, and express greater distrust 

of Japan. Compared to their progressive counterparts, PPP politicians tend to emphasize the 

importance of maintaining a strong U.S. -ROK alliance, are more skeptical of the value of 

engaging North Korea, express less reluctance to enter into formal cooperative arrangements w ith 

Japan, and during their time as opposition party in recent years have become more willing to 

criticize China ’s behavior.

Thus far, the front -runners in the South Korean presidential campaign have been by the Minjoo 

Party ’s Lee Jae -myung and the opposition, right -of -center People Power Party ’s Yoon Seok -

youl . Lee is the governor of Gyeonggi Province, which surrounds Seoul and Incheon. He has 

proposed a universal basic income policy that eventually would provide every South Korean with 

annual payments of 6 million won (around $5,000), to be paid in monthly allocations. 34 (South 

Korea ’s per capita GDP is around $29,000, about half the U.S. level.) On foreign policy issues, 

Lee has said he would continue to expand Moon ’s emphasis on engaging North Korea by 

establishing a Korean Peninsular “peace economy, ” securing sanctions relief for North Korea, and 

obtaining permanent exemptions from sanctions for inter -Korean projects. He also has said 

sanctions should be “immediately reinstated ” if North Korea does not uphold its denuclearization 

commitments. Stating that South Korea should assert its “spirit of independence, ” when de aling 

with PRC -U.S. tensions, Lee has said, “There is no reason to choose either side to narrow the 

scope of our movement on our own. ”35 

A political newcomer, Yoon had a nearly three -decade career as a prosecutor before announcing 

his bid for the Presidency . In 2016, he helped lead the investigation into a corruption scandal that 

led to then -President Park Geun -hye ’s impeachment and removal from office. Yoon has criticized 

the Moon government for being insufficiently committed to North Korea ’s denuclearizati on, and 

has proposed making economic aid to North Korea and inter -Korean economic cooperation

conditional upon North Korea ’s progress in denuclearizing. However, he has argued that 

humanitarian aid to ordinary North Koreans be provided unconditionally —whic h also is the 

Moon government ’s preferred approach —and has pledged to set up a permanent North -South -

U.S. liaison office in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas. 36 Yoon also has 

said he would improve South Korea ’s relations with Japan and has supported South Korea ’s

participation in the working groups of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (“the Quad ”), a

cooperative forum that includes Australia, India, Japan, and the United Stat es. 37 Among Yoon ’s

domestic economic pledges is to build hund reds of thousands of subsidized housing units to help 

reign in soaring real estate prices. 

If the presidential race between Lee and Yoon is close, the performance of third -party candidates 

could prove decisive. In the country ’s seven presidential elections since the end of military rule in 

1987, only the 2012 race produced a winner who captured a majority of the vote. The alternative 

party candidate with the most support in polls, generally in the 10% -15% range as of mid -

January, is Ahn Cheol -Soo, the head of the small People ’s Party (not to be confused with the 

People Power Party). Ahn ’s poll numbers have increased since mid -December, when they 

generally were in the single digits, raising speculation that he and Yoon may form a unified 

opposition ticket. 38 Ahn also ran in the 2012 election, ultimately withdrawing to back Moon ’s

failed bid, and the 2017 election, when he finished third, receiving 21% of the vote. 

# South Korea ’s COVID -19 Response 

Despite being one of the countries first hit by COVID -19 in early 2020, South Korea has 

prevented infections and deaths to a much greater degree than most higher -income countries, 

without resorting to lockdowns. As of February 17 , 2022, the country reported around 1.7 million 

cumulative cases and around 7,200 deaths. Sou th Korea ’s population is over 51 million, or about 

1/6 th the population of the United States. Over 90% of the country ’s cases and two -thirds of its 

COVID -19 deaths occurred during the nearly eight -month period between June 2021 and mid -

February 2022, the p eriod the more contagious Delta and Omicron variants are presumed to have 

spread to and within South Korea. 39 

The spread of the COVID -19 Delta variant, combined with a slow start to South Korea ’s

vaccination campaign, led the Moon government in the late spring of 2021 to accelerate its 

attempts to acquire vaccines, including in the weeks before the May 2021 Biden -Moon summit. 

In part as a re sult of these efforts, by late January 2022, over 85% of the population had been 

fully vaccinated, and over 50% had received booster shots. 40 Under the May 2021 U.S. -ROK 

vaccine partnership, South Korean biopharmaceutical companies plan to mass -produce and

The government ’s relative success in responding to COVID -19 stems in part from lessons learned 

after a 2015 deadly outbreak of Middle East Respirator y Syndrome (MERS) exposed flaws in the 

country ’s public health system. In response, South Korea passed legislation granting the 

government greater powers to monitor and track individual patients and to allow private 

companies to produce health tests rapidl y. These changes have helped South Korea manage the 

COVID -19 pandemic with aggressive testing, contact tracing, public communication, widespread 

mask -wearing, and episodic restrictions on social gatherings that generally have been calibrated 

to the severit y of the outbreak in a particular geographic location. At times, South Korea has 

prohibited large gatherings, including anti -government rallies, prompting international criticism. 42 

# South Korea Expands its Regional Diplomacy: CPTPP and 

# Australia 

For years, as great power rivalry has intensified in the Indo -Pacific region , South Korea has been 

relatively inactive in major Indo -Pacific diplomatic and strategic partnerships and agreements 

compared to the United States and many other U.S. regional allies, espec ially Japan and Australia ,

despite U.S. efforts to encourage Seoul to increase its involvement . With the exception of the 15 -

country Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) , which took effect for South 

Korea in February 2022 , South Ko rea general ly has eschewed the region ’s major new institutions 

and multi -country arrangements , such as the Quad. President Moon ’s 2017 New Southern Policy 

of deepening relations with Southeast Asia and India largely has focused on economic matters ,

and for years effo rts to develop linkages between the New Southern Policy and the United States ’

Indo -Pacific policy remained nascent. 43 

In late 2021, Moon took steps that could signal a deeper South Korea n effort to play a greater role 

in regional power dynamics beyond the Korean Peninsula. In December, senior government 

officials announced that, in accordance with South Korean legal requirements for entering into 

economic agreements, they would begin discussing with domestic stakeholders the implications 

of joining the 11 -nation Comprehensive and Progressive Trans -Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). The 

Moon government plans to seek to apply formally for membership by the time Moon leaves 

office in May 2022. 44 The CPTPP is the successor arrangement to the Trans -Pacific Partnership 

(TPP), from which President Trump withdrew the United States in 2017. In the fall of 2021, 

China and T aiwan formally applied to join CPTPP , moves that may have contributed to South 

Korea ’s announcement .45 (For more, see the “Bilateral Economic Relations ” section.) 

In another regional move in December 2021, Moon became the first foreign leader to visit 

Australia since the COVI D-19 pandemic struck. In Canberra, he and Prime Minister Scott

Morrison announced a new Comprehens ive Strategic Partnership, agreeing to closer cooperation 

between the two countries ’ defense industries as well as expanded cooperation on supply chain 

resili ence in key minerals, pandemic response, infrastructure and digital technology assistance 

programs in Southeast Asia, space, and digital trade. As part of the summit, the Australian 

Defence Department signed a nearly $1 billion agreement with the South Kor ean conglomerate 

Hanhwa to build self -propelled artillery equipment and other material for the Australian Army, to 

be manufactured in Australia. Although Moon emphasized the economic aspects of the 

partnership more than the strategic elements, and the two leaders did not cite the PRC as a factor 

in their partnership, their joint statement mentioned many of the same PRC -related themes as the 

May 2021 Biden -Moon summit, with the notable exception of Taiwan. They also announced 

expanded cooperation on a number of the same issues —including supply chains, COVID -19 

coordination, infrastructure cooperation in the Indo -Pacific, and climate change —on which the 

United States has been seeking to deepen cooperation with its Indo -Pacific allies and partners. 46

# Background on U.S. -South Korea Relations 

# Overview 

Although the U.S. -South Korea relationship is complex and multifaceted, five factors arguably 

drive the scope and state of relations between the two allies , as well as congressional interest in 

U.S. -South Korea relations :

 the challenges posed by North Korea, particularly its weapons of mass 

destruction programs , cyber -attacks , as well as occasionally different perceptions 

about the level and nature of the threats posed b y the Kim Jong -un regime, 

through its actions and/or the risk of its collapse; 

 the PRC ’s rising influence and assertiveness , which has made China an 

increasingly integral consideration in many aspects of U.S. -South Korea strategic 

and economic policymaking ;

 South Korea ’s status as one of the world ’s leading economies and its firms ’

integral role in the supply chain of several key industries , which have made the 

South Korean government and South Korean conglomerates key players in 

discussions over issues suc h as the shape of the region ’s economic institutions, 

supply chain resiliency, and digital trade ;

 South Korea ’s continued democratization since military rule ended in 1988 ,

which has increas ed the influence public opinion often has on Seoul ’s foreign 

poli cy ; and 

 the growing desire of South Korean leaders to use the country ’s middle -power 

status to achieve greater autonomy, including within the U.S. -ROK alliance, and 

to play a larger regional global role. 

Additionally, while people -to -people ties generally do not directly affect matters of “high ”

politics in bilateral relations, the presence of over 2 million Korean Americans and the hundreds 

of thousands of trips taken annually between the two nations before the COVID -19 pandemic has 

helped cement the two countries together culturally and economically . Over the past decade, the 

global successes of South Korean cultural content producers —including pop music groups BTS 

and Blackpink, video productions such as the Academy -award winner Parasite and the Netflix hit 

Squid Game , and world -class video game companies and competitors —has boosted the appeal of 

South Korea generally, arguably expanding the South Korean government ’s potential influence 

regionally and globally. 47 Six South Korean president s have addressed joint meetings of Congress 

since the ROK ’s founding in 1948. T he last was President Park Geun -hye, in May 2013. 48

According to multiple polls conducted in recent years, over 85% of South Koreans say they value 

the U.S. -ROK alliance and over 70% have positive opinions of the United States. 49 Since at least 

2014 , South Koreans have co nsistently indicated that the United States is their favorite nation ,

according to one opinion poll .50 However, many South Koreans chafe when they feel their leader s

offer too many concessions to the United States . In addition , many South Korean officials tend to 

be wary of being drawn into U.S. policies that they perceive as possibly antagoniz ing China , and 

to be suspicious of Japan ’s efforts —generally backed by the United States —to increase its 

influence in East Asia, including in the military sphere. These concerns are pa rticularly 

articulated by South Korea ’s progressive groups such as President Moon ’s Minjoo Party. 

# Historical Background 

The United States and South Korea have been allies since the United States intervened on the 

Korean Peninsula in 1950 and fought with ROK troops and allied nations to repel a North Korean 

takeover of South Korea. Over 36 ,000 U.S. troops died and over 100,0 00 were wounded in -

theater during the three -year conflict. 51 On October 1, 1953, a little more than two months after 

the parties to the conflict signed an armistice agreement, the United States and South Korea 

signed a Mutual Defense Treaty, which provides that if either party is attacked by a third country, 

the other party will act to meet the common danger. On January 26, 1954, the Senate ratified the 

treaty by a vote of 81 -6. 52 

Beginning in the 1960s, rapid economic growth propelled South Korea into the r anks of the 

world ’s largest industrialized countries. For over two decades, South Korea has been one of the 

United States ’ largest trading partners. Economic growth, coupled with South Korea ’s

transformation in the late 1980s from a dictatorship to a democ racy, also has helped transform the 

ROK into a mid -level regional power that can influence U.S. policy in Northeast Asia, 

particularly the United States ’ approach toward North Korea.

Foreign Relations Committee that the treaty only obligated the United States to aid the ROK for an attack “against 

territory which has been recognized by the United States as lawfully brought under the administrati ve control of the

Committee discussion, that the ROK might seize territory through an unprovoked attack or another means that the 

United States regar ded as unlawful. At the time, South Korean president Rhee Syngman, who opposed the 1953

Between 2009 and the end of 2016 , relations between the United States and South Korea (known 

officially as the Republic of Korea, or ROK) arguably were at their most robust since the 

formation of the U.S. -ROK alliance in 1953 . Cemented by strong relationships with two 

successive conservative governments in Seoul, U.S. -South Kor ea c ooperation on North Korea 

policy was particularly close , with the two countries essentially forging and continuously 

adapting a joint approach in the face of a changing threat from Pyongyang .

Under the administrations of Donald Trump and Moon Jae -in, who was elected in May 2017, the 

relationship beca me more strained. Although the two governments cooperated across a range of 

issues and their publicly stated policies toward North Korea overlap ped , subtle and not -so -subtle 

differences in approach to North Korea, China, and trade made collaboration more difficult. The 

election of Moon, a progressive politician who assumed the presidency after a decade of 

conservative rule, on its own likely would have made U.S. -South Korea relations more 

challenging because of his stated desire to engage with North Korea at a time the U.S. alarm over 

the North Korean threat was rising. These bilateral differences were exacerbated by the Trump 

Administration ’s actions and President Trump ’s words, particularly his open talk of attacking 

North Korea in 2017 , his Administration ’s frequently mixed signals on its approach toward 

Pyongyang, and reports that he wanted to withdraw from the KORUS FTA and pull troops out of 

South Korea .53 In efforts to forestall the latter, t he 115 th and 116 th Congress es inserted provisions 

into the National Defense Authorization Acts (P.L. 115 -232 ; P.L. 116 -92 ) that condition ed the 

President ’s authority to reduce the number of U.S. troops in South Korea. (For more details, see 

the “Security Relations and the U.S. -ROK Alliance ” section.) 

# North Korea in U.S. -ROK Relations 

Overview 

South Korea ’s growing economic, diplomatic, and military power over the past generation has 

given Seoul a more direct and prominent role in Washington ’s planning and thinking about how 

to deal with Pyongyang. Additionally, North Korean leader Kim Jong -un has linked progress on 

denuclearization talks and in inter -Korean relations to the cessation of U.S. joint military 

exercises with South Korea and shipments of ad vanced military equipment to South Korea .54 As 

South Korea has become a more powerful and assertive actor, its leaders often have pushed for a 

greater say in policy. Differences in approach can complicate U.S. interests. Although leaders in 

both countries have sought North Korea ’s denuclearization, the two sides at times place a 

different emphasis on the extent to which the pursuit of improvements in inter -Korean relations 

should be linked to progress in the denuclearization goal. 

Another complicating factor in policy collaboration has been North Ko rea ’s apparent progress in 

being able to militarily strike the United States . On the one hand, this means the United States ’

security is becoming more intertwined with South Korea ’s and the U.S. -ROK alliance ’s ability to 

in fluence North Korea ’s behavior. On the other hand, a greater sense of threat could lead to future 

scenarios where U.S. policymakers feel they need to act in a unilateral fashion against a feared 

North Korean attack. 55 Yet another complication is that North Korea ’s ability to target U.S.

ov erseas bases and perhaps the U.S. homeland , including with a nuclear weapon, could cause 

some in South Korea to doubt U.S. commitment to South Korea ’s defense , a perception that could 

provide an incentive for South Koreans to adopt more independent North K orea policies from the 

United States. 

North Korea Policy Coordination under Obama and Trump 

From 2009 to 2016, the Obama Administration and its South Korean counterparts, the Lee 

Myung -bak (2008 -2013) and Park Geun -hye (2013 -2017) governments, maintained t ight 

coordination over North Korea policy, following a joint approach —often called “strategic 

patience ”—that involved elements of both engagement and pressure. 56 Washington and Seoul 

tended to reach out to North Korea during relatively quiescent periods. In contrast, they tended to 

emphasize pressure tactics during times of increased tension with North Korea. In 2016, in 

response to Pyongyang ’s nuclear tests and missile launches , Washington and Seoul placed 

significant emphasis on the harder elements of their approach , expanding multilateral and 

unilateral sanctions and engaging in muscular displays of military cooperation .

The Trump Administration initially expanded upon these pressure tactics, for instance by securing 

a dramatic expansion of United Nat ions Security Council (UNSC ) international sanctions in 2017 

before pivoting to top -down diplomacy in 2018 and 2019 .57 Under the Trump and Moon 

administrations, however, bilateral cooperation over North Korea often appeared to occur in a 

fits -and -starts man ner. Although there was considerable overlap in the countries ’ approaches to 

North Korea, there also were important differences that occasionally surfaced publicly . These 

often had to do either with Moon ’s desire to offer more and earlier concessions to Py ongyang 

than Washington preferred, or to one side or the other adopting a position without significant 

prior consultation .

The current period of U.S .-DPRK diplomacy under the Biden Administration in many ways 

began in January 2016, when North Korea conduct ed its fourth nuclear test . Over the following 

two years, Pyongyang conducted two additional nuclear tests and scores of missile tests, 

demonstrating major strides in its ability to strike the continental United States with a nuclear -

armed ballistic missil e. The Obama and Trump Administrations , supported by the Park

government and the caretaker administration that governed during the months after Park was 

removed from office in 2016 , responded by expanding multilateral and unilateral sanctions 

against North Korea. 

After taking office in May 2017, Moon supported the “maximum pressure ” campaign that the 

Trump Administration declared earlier that year, but he also retained his longstanding preference 

for engaging Pyongyang . During 2017, Trump Administration officials, including the President ,

repeatedly raised the possibility of launching a preventive military strike against North Korea, 

which could have triggered DPRK retaliation against South Korea . The combination of the fear of 

war, an ideo logical preference for engagement, and a belief that South Korea should shape the 

future of the Korean Peninsula drove Moon to improve inter -Korean relations and push for U.S. -

DPRK talks. Moon argues that expanded relations between Seoul and Pyongyang coul d create a 

path to peace on the Peninsula, greater stability and economic prosperity for South Korea, North 

Korean denuclearization, and –over the long run –eventual reunification. 58

In 2018, DPRK leader Kim Jong -un declared “victory ” in developing nuclear warhead and ICBM 

capability, said he would suspend nuclear testing, and signaled his willingness to engage in talks 

with the United States and South Korea. 59 Kim and Moon met three times during the year, both 

before and after a Trump -Kim summit with Trump in Singapore in June, a meeting Moon helped 

broker. During his diplomatic outreach, K im pledged to: “work toward complete denuclearization 

of the Korean Peninsula; ” not conduct nuclear or long -range missile tests while dialogue with the 

United States continues; and allow the “permanent dismantlement ” of North Korea ’s Yongbyon 

nuclear site. 60 He and Moon also negotiated a military confidence -building arrangement that

Kim and Trump met again in Hanoi in February 2019, with Moon ’s support. T he Hanoi summit 

collapsed , however, due to differences over the scope and sequencing of concessions, specifically 

North Korean denuclearization measures in exchange for sanctions relief. Despite a third Trump -

Kim meeting in Panmunjom for o ne hour in June 2019 —Moon was present for part of the 

meeting —subsequent U.S. -DPRK and inter -Korean diplomacy stalled. 62 When the COVID -19 

pandemic began in early 2020, North Korea responded by sealing itself off from the outside 

world. No rth Korean diplo mats are not known to have had substantive contact with their U.S. or 

ROK counterparts since. Moreover, since May 2019, North Korea has conducted multiple short -

range ballistic missile tests in violation of U.N. prohibitions .

Under Moon, Seoul generally h as favored offering more and earlier concessions to Pyongyang 

than Washington. International and U.S. sanctions , howe ver, prevent Moon from doing more 

without U.S. approval, contributing to periodic tensions that surfaced under the Trump 

Administration . Fo r instance, in the fall of 2018, following the signing of an inter -Korean military 

agreement and weeks of South Korean efforts to initiate inter -Korean economic projects, the 

Treasury Department ’s Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence reportedly called 

executives in charge of compliance at seven South Korean banks expressing “concern ” about 

premature financial cooperation between the two Koreas, and to issue reminders about U .N. and 

U.S. sanctions. 63 Partially to prevent these types of incidents, in November 2018, the United 

States and ROK created a working group that helped improve coordination despite significant 

disagreements in approach .64 The Biden and Moon administrations disbanded the working group, 

which the Biden Administration said was unnecessary because of “close and constant 

coordination. ”65

An other example of these latent bilateral tensions surfacing occurred in mid -January 2020 . President Moon in h is 

annual New Year’s press conference said “Inter -Korean relations is our problem, so we have to have a willingness to 

make progress a little more independently,” and he and members of his Cabinet began mentioning the possibility of 

seeking exemptions from U.N. sanctions and of allowing South Korean citizens to conduct “independent” tours in 

North Korea, which are not prohibited per se by U.N. sanctions. “Moon Says it's Early to be Pessimistic about Dialogue 

with N. Korea,” Korea Now , January 14, 2020 . Days later, then -U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Harry Harris 

reportedly said that South Korean proposals to allow independent tourism to North Korea should be discussed in the 

U.S. -South Korean working group on North Korea “to avoid a misunderstanding later th at could trigger” U.S. or U.N. 

sanctions and to coordinate possible DMZ crossings with the U.N. Command. The following day, an official with the 

Blue House (South Korea’s presidential office) reportedly said that although Seoul “always ” closely consults wi th 

Washington, “it's very inappropriate for the ambassador to make such a mention for media over remarks by the 

president of the hosting nation.” Chad O'Carroll, “U.S. Should be Consulted on Potential South Korean Tourism to the

be dangerous to its own peace and safety and declares that it would act to meet the common 

danger .” 66 Under Article IV of the agreement, U.S. military personnel have maintained a 

contin uous presence on the Korean Peninsula and are committed to help ing South Korea defend 

itself, particularly against any aggression from the North. South Korea is included under the U.S. 

“nuclear umbrella, ” also known as “extended deterrence. ”67 About 28,500 U.S. troops are 

stationed in the ROK. The origins of the military partnership stem from the 1950 -1953 Korean 

War, during which over 36,000 Americans died in -theater .68 South Korea sent more troops to join 

the Vietnam War than any other country other than th e United States, and since has joined other 

U.S. -led conflicts in the Persian Gulf, Afghanistan, and Iraq. South Korea has dispatched 57,000 

troops to 30 countries at the request of the United States or the United Nations. 69 A late 2019 

poll —in the midst of a contentious standoff in burden -sharing negotiations —indicated that 92% 

of South Koreans supported the alliance with the United States. 70 

Together the allies maintain formidable capabilities. The ROK armed forces today total 599,000 

active duty troops .71 In 2020, South Korea had the 10 th -largest defense spending in the world, 

constituting about 2.8% of its GDP. 72 Under a program known as Defense Reform 2.0, South 

Korea is investing heavily in new military equipment. Plans include a 30 ,000 –35,000 -ton LPX -II 

light aircraft carrier that are to host F-35B combat aircraft and helicopters. 73 In addition to these 

investments in technology, the ROK military is integrating civilian expertise as ground troop 

numbers decline. 74 USFK operates about 90 combat planes, 40 a ttack helicopters, 50 tanks and 

some 60 Patriot missile launchers, according to South Korea ’s 2020 Defense White Paper. 75 

Since assuming office in 2017, Moon has accelerated South Korea ’s drive to increase its 

indigenous military capabilities. In August 202 0, the Ministry of National Defense (MND) 

announced plans to increase defense spending by 35% by 2025, which would put South Korea ’s

defense budget on a trajectory to surpass Japan ’s over the coming decade. 76 Although the Mid -

Term Defense plan outlined more modest increases, South Korea nevertheless appears poised to 

significantly expand its defense spending. 77 The increases aim to boost acquisitions, facilitate the 

transfer of wartime operational control (OPCON; see “OPCON Transfer ”), and respond to South 

Korea ’s demographic challenges, which constrain its conscription forces. The moves also reflect 

a response to North Korea ’s military advancements and a long standing desire by progressive 

South Korean leaders, including Moon, to expand South Korea ’s influence over military matters 

on the Korean Peninsula. South Korea ’s increasing economic and military capabilities, combined 

with North Korea ’s increased ability to threaten the United States with nuclear attack, leads some 

long -standing critics of the U.S. -ROK alliance to argue that the United States should consider 

withdrawing some or all of its troops from the Peninsula and/or terminate its defense 

commitments to South Korea. 78 

Congress has a variety of routine means to influence the executive branch ’s handling of the U.S. -

ROK alliance. The House and Senate Armed Services Committees generally hold annual 

hearings , usually in the first quarter of the year, on U.S. military activities in the Indo -Pacific that 

include the USFK Commander . These hearings provide opportunities for Members to raise 

questions about alliance issues such as alliance coordination beyond the Korean Peninsula, the 

impact of the interruption of major bilateral military exercises since 2018, and the effectiveness 

of bilateral extended deterrence discussions. Additionally , the annual National Defense 

Authorization Act (NDAA) usually includes multiple provisions related to South Korea and North 

Kor ea. From 2018 -2020, for instance, some Members who sought to restrain President Trump ’s

ability to make significant shifts in force structure in the region inserted into the NDAA 

provision s prohibiting the use of funds to reduce USFK forces below certain levels unle ss specific 

conditions were met. 79 

Alliance Coordination: Beyond the Peninsula? 

In 2021, U.S. and South Korean military leaders spoke of “promoting defense and security 

cooperation ” in the Indo -Pacific , echoing language expressed in the May 2021 Biden -Moon 

statement. It remains to be seen, however, whether expanded regional diplomatic and economic 

cooperation will be matched in the military sphere. When questioned about what form re gional 

military cooperation might take , the two defense ministries have tended to mention diplomatic, 

rather than military, initiatives. 80 Although the Biden -Moon joint statement mentioned the Taiwan

Strait and the South China Sea as areas of concern, it di d not directly mention China. This is in 

contrast to how Japan has framed its stance toward China in joint statements with the United 

States. 81 While firmly reiterating the importance of the alliance, South Korean leaders have been 

reluctant to join U.S. -le d security initiatives in the region, particularly as U.S. -China relations 

have worsened .82 Coordinating arms sales to U.S. allies and partners may be one area of 

cooperation, as perhaps indicated by the South Korean conglomerate Hanhwa ’s December 2021 

agre ement to provide nearly $1 billion in self -propelled artillery equipment and other material to 

Australia. 

A bilateral understanding between Washington and Seoul gives U.S. forces the “strategic 

flexibility ” to respond to contingencies outside the peninsul a, on the condition that U.S. officials 

consult with ROK authorities . During his confirmation hearing, new USFK Commander Paul 

LaCamera advocated for utilizing USFK capabilities in a range of Indo -Pacific contingencies. 83 If 

U.S. troops stationed in South Korea more regularly rotated to areas such as the South China Sea, 

there could be significant repercussions —for command structure and mission definition, among 

others —for the Combined Forces Command (CFC, a binational com mand), which has in the past 

been almost solely focused on the DPRK. 

If the USFK expands its activities beyond those aimed at deterring and defeating the DPRK, the 

alliance partners may need to adjust significantly the way that they train and engage with each 

other. Some strategists point to potential deficiencies in command and control integration, as well 

as change s to the balance of power on the Peninsula if ROK and U.S. forces engage elsewhere in 

the region. 84 However, analysts remain cautious about pre dicting any major shifts in combined 

force posture in the near future. For one, the ROK military remains primarily focused on North 

Korea ’s growing capabilities. Further, Seoul may be wary of signing on to expanded cooperation 

with the United States becaus e of a perception that U.S. strategy and priorities can shift after 

presidential elections. 85 Some U.S. analysts disagree with using the U.S. -ROK alliance to try to 

(SCM) Joint Communique says, “ the Minister and the Secretary pledged to continue promoting defense and security 

cooperation in the Indo -Pacific region an d the world where mutual interests align, in order to better respond to regional 

and global security challenges.” The rest of this article in the document primarily discusses cooperation in the 

diplomatic arena, such as seeking cooperation between the Unit ed States’ Indo -Pacific strategy and South Korea’s New 

Southern Policy, which is fundamentally an economic and diplomatic initiative. (See “ South Korea’s New Southern 

Policy ” below.) Department of Defense, “53 rd Security Consultative Meeting Joint Communique,” December 2, 2021.

the Korean Peninsula by deterring North Korea. 86 

Military Exercises 

The U.S. and ROK militaries for years have conducted large -scale drills to test alliance 

interoperability, but the drills have been interrupted over the past few years for a range of r easons. 

At a summit with North Korean Leader Kim Jong -un in Singapore in June 2018, President Trump 

called for a cancellation of large -scale military exercises, declaring them “very expensive ” and 

“provocative. ”87 With the resumption of smaller, less public exercises in 2019, U.S. military 

officials asserted that the alliance maintained readiness, but some analysts warn ed that any 

reduction in joint exercises could damage alliance cohesion. 88 The two governments ’ concerns 

about the COVID -19 pandemic, as well as their desire to facilitate diplomacy with the DPRK, led 

them to postpone exercises planned for February 2020. The two sides conducted scaled -back 

computer simulation exercises in August 2021, which North Korea criticized as preparation for 

war. Prior to the exercises, over 70 ROK lawmakers called on Moon to postpone the exercises in 

light of the summer 2021 decision by North Korea to re -open some communication channels with 

the South. 89 

South Korea ’s Nuclear Armament Debate 

Since 2013, North Korea ’s nucl ear weapon tests and multiple missile launches have rekindled a 

debate in South Korea about developing its own nuclear weapons capability, notwithstanding 

Seoul ’s reliance on the U.S. nuclear deterrent. 90 President George H.W. Bush announced the 

removal of all U.S. tactical nuclear weapons abroad in 1991, some of which were based in South 

Korea. Some analysts have argued that North Korea ’s advancing nuclear weapons and missile 

ca pa bilities, including a pos sible second strike capability, may undermine the United States ’

commitment to South Korea ’s defense . To reassure South Korea, the United States reaffirmed the 

U.S. security guarantee, including extended deterrence under the United States ’ so -called “nucle ar 

umbrella. ” An October 2016 joint “2+2” statement issued by U.S. and South Korean Foreign and 

Defense Ministers restated the U.S. position that “any use of nuclear weapons [by North Korea] 

will be met with an effective and overwhelming response. ” At the 2+2 meeting, the two sides 

agreed to establish a new, Extended Deterrence Strategy and Consultation Group (EDSCG). 91 In 

2018, the Trump and Moon administrations agreed to regularize the dialogue.

Debates about nuclearization have become more prominent in p olitical circles in Seoul in recent 

years. 92 Following North Korea ’s September 2016 nuclear test, a group of National Assembly 

members from the then -ruling Saenuri Party called on the ROK government to consider 

developing nuclear weapons. 93 A presidential ad visory group, the National Unification Advisory 

Council, in an October 2016 report recommended that South Korea consider a return of U.S. 

tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea, an idea that retains currency among some conservative 

South Korean thinkers. 94 Some ROK presidential primary candidates in 2021 reportedly argued 

for a nuclear sharing arrangement with the United States, or an independent nuclear weapons 

program. 95 In a 2021 Asan Institute poll, 69.3% of respondents indicated they favor “the 

developm ent of nuclear weapons in South Korea, ” the highest level of support since the Asan 

Institute began asking this question in 2010. At the same time, the poll showed over 61% favored 

reintroducing U.S. tactical nuclear weapons and almost 96% of respondents f avored continued 

maintenance of the U.S. -ROK alliance. 96 

Analysts point to the potentially negative consequences for South Korea if it were to develop its 

own nuclear weapons, including significant costs; reduced international standing in the campaign 

to de nuclearize North Korea; the possible imposition of economic sanctions that would be 

trig gered by leaving the global non proliferation regime; and potentially encouraging Japan to 

develop nuclear weapons capability . For the United States, South Korea develop ing nuclear 

weapons could mean diminished U.S. influence in Asia, the unraveling of the U.S. alliance 

system, and the possibility of creating a destabilizing nuclear arms race in Asia. 97 Other analysts, 

however, argue that South Korea would be justified in possessing its own nuclear arsenal given 

the DPRK ’s increasing capabilities. They also contend a South Korean nuclear arsenal could 

mitigate domestic concerns about Washington ’s willingness to uphold its alliance commitments in 

the event of war with the No rth .98 

ROK ’s Missile Defense Program 

South Korea began earnestly pursuing an indigenous ballistic missile defense (BMD) following 

North Korea ’s first nuclear test in 2006, and BMD has become an increasingly important 

component of the country ’s defense capabilities since then. Missile defense is among the 

capabilities prioritized in Moon ’s “Defense Reform 2.0” modernization plan. 99 The United States

has long urged South Korea to integrate its missile defense system into the wider U.S. BMD 

architecture in the region, arguing it would strengthen South Korean and regional BMD 

capabilities overall. Seoul has consistently declined to do so in favor of operating its own system .

Analysts attribute South Korea ’s insistence on separate systems to its desire to preserve strategic 

autonomy, skepticism of deepening cooperation with its historical rival Jap an, wariness of 

angering China, and desire to boost its domestic defense industry. 100 In July 2016, after years of 

consideration and controversy, South Korea agreed to a U.S. request to deploy a Terminal High -

Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense sys tem in South Korea to help defend against 

North Korea ’s improving missile s. Seoul ’s decision triggered a harsh diplomatic and economic 

response from China. The Sino -ROK dispute was ameliorated in late 2017 in part due to the 

Moon government ’s public pledge not to integrate into a U.S. regional BMD system. (See “South 

Korea -China Relations ” below.) 

South Korea ’s BMD system, the Korea Air and Missile Defense (or KAMD) system, has been 

upgraded with both domestic and foreign components since the program launched in 2006. 

Initially featuring secondhand Patriot Advanced Capability (PAC) -2 batteries from Germany and 

Israeli Super Green Pine radars, KAMD now incor porates PAC -3 systems that double the range 

of the PAC -2s. 101 The ROK Navy is building BMD -capable Aegis destroyers set to enter service 

beginning in 2024 (the United States stations BMD -capable Aegis ships in South Korea; the ROK 

Navy ’s current Aegis destro yers are not BMD -capable). 102 KAMD also features indigenously 

developed medium -range surface -to -air missiles and long -range surface -to -air missiles. 103 

The Relocation of U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) 

The United States continues to execute its planned realignment o f all U.S . forces from bases near 

the de militarized zone (DMZ) border with North Korea to bases farther south . The realignment 

plan reflects the shift toward a supporting role for USFK and a desire to resolve the issues arising 

from the location of the lar ge U.S. Yongsan base in downtown Seoul.  In line with the 2002 Land 

Partnership Plan and the 2004 Yongsan Relocation Plan, several U.S. units from Yongsan and 

associated troops and facilities have relocated, most to Camp Humphreys , located near the city of 

Pyeongtaek some 40 miles south of Seoul. Camp Humphreys is the largest U.S. overseas base. 

The original cost estimate was over $10 billion; South Korea was to contribute $4 billion of this. 

Estimates in 2010 placed the overall cost s at over $13 billion. In congressional testimony in April 

2016 , a U.S. official stated that South Korea is funding 91% of the total $10.7 billion cost of 

USFK relocations .104

As of July 2021, according to press reports, USFK has returned 68 of the 80 bases designated for 

returns to South Korea .105 In July, the two governments agreed to accelerate the process, with a 

pledge to officially return about one -quarter of the large Yongsan Garrison by early 2022. 106 

Although the USFK headquarters have moved to Camp Hump hreys, the Combined Forces 

Command (CFC, a binational command), remains at Yongsan. Outstanding issues include 

environmental contamination cleanup, which could result in further delays in the return of 

additional land .

Cost Sharing 

Since 1991, South Korea has provided financial support through a series of Special Measures 

Agreements (SMAs) to offset the cost of stationing U.S. forces in Korea. These negotiations on 

cost -sharing arrangements generally occur every five years. While these tal ks are often 

contentious, they became particularly divisive during the Trump Administration because of the 

United States ’ requests for steep increases in South Korean contributions . Press reports indicated 

that the Trump Administration asked South Korea to increase its contribution by roughly 400%. 107 

After signing a one -year stop -gap measure in February 2019 that raised South Korea ’s previous 

annual contribution by approximately 8%, the pact expired in December 2019, leading to the 

furlough of about 4,500 Ko reans who worked on U.S. bases. 108 Weeks after coming into office, 

the Biden Administration concluded a new five -year agreement in March 2021, removing an 

irritant to the relationship. Under the agreement, South Korea will pay about $1 billion annually, 

repr esenting an increase of about 13.9% over previous SMAs. 109

In the past, South Korea generally paid for 40 -50% (over $800 million annually) of the total non -

personnel costs of maintaining the U.S. troop presence in South Korea .110 ROK payments —a

combination of in -kind and cash contributions —fall into three categories: labor (salaries for the 

Koreans who work on U.S. bases); logistics; and construction (by ROK firms for U.S. facilities). 

South Korean officials also point to Seoul ’s contributions to the alliance b eyond the SMA 

agreement as evidence of their investment in the relationship and mutual defense .

Military expenditures account for 2.8 % of South Korea ’s GDP, one of the largest percentage s

among all U.S. allies. 111 The ROK government is paying $9.7 billion, or about 90% of the total 

cost of constructing Camp Humphreys, and is a top buyer of U.S. defense systems. 

OPCON Transfer 

An agreement made in 2007 to transfer wartime operational control to the South Korean military 

remains unimplemented. Under the exist ing arrangement, in the event of war, South Korean and 

U.S. soldiers would be under U.S. command, led by the commander of the binational Combined 

Forces Command (CFC), a U.S. four -star general who concurrently serves as USFK 

commander. 112 If wartime OPCON is transferred, a South Korean commander would become 

CFC head, answering to both U.S. and ROK civilian authorities; neither side will relinquish 

command authority over their own troops. 113 The plan to transfer OPCON, which has generated 

controversy among fore ign policy thinkers in South Korea, recognizes the ROK ’s advances in 

economic and military strength since the Korean War , and is viewed by many Koreans as 

important for ROK sovereignty. 114 

Like past ROK progressive leaders, President Moon has prioritized OP CON and moved to 

accelerate the process. The two sides have established conditions and benchmarks to demonstrate 

that the ROK can assume wartime OPCON, including improved ROK capabilities to lead 

combined forces and counter the DPRK nuclear and missile thr eat, and a security environment on 

the Peninsula conducive to a transfer. 115 Significant progress has been made on some of these 

areas, but it appears unlikely that the process will be completed by the conclusion of Moon ’s

term. 

The 2007 agreement to transition OPCON has been delayed twice , both times under conservative 

South Korean presidents . In 2010, the OPCON transfer was postponed to 2015 after a series of 

provocations from North Korea and amid concerns about whether South Korean forces were

adequ ately prepared to assume responsibility. As the new deadline of 2015 grew closer, concerns 

again emerged about the timing. Reportedly, South Korean officials worried that their military 

was not fully prepared to cope with North Korean threats and that Pyon gyang might interpret the 

OPCON transfer as a weakening of the alliance ’s deterrence. 116 Some South Korean military 

experts expressed concern that turning over control would lead to the United States reducing its 

overall commitment to South Korean security. 117 In October 2014, the United States and South 

Korea announced in a joint statement that the allies would take a “conditions -based approach ” to 

the OPCON transfer and determine the appropriate timing based on South Korean military 

capabilities and the secur ity environment on the Korean Peninsula. 118 

South Korean Defense Industry and Purchases of U.S. Weapon Systems 

Under Moon, South Korea has increased its defense budget significantly. In December 2021, 

South Korea ’s National Assembly approved a FY2022 defens e budget of $46.32 billion. This 

represented a 3.4% increase from the FY2021 budget, although it was 1% less than the M oon 

Administration ’s request .119 This follows a 7.6% increase in FY2017 and an 8.2% increase in 

FY2018, the highest among OECD member count ries. 

South Korea is a major recipient of U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS). From FY2017 to FY2020, 

South Korean FMS contracts with the United States totaled $5.95 billion, making it the tenth -

largest recipient during those years. 120 Although European and I sraeli defense companies also 

compete for contracts, from 2008 to 2016, approximately 75% of South Korea ’s total foreign 

defense purchases were FMS and commercial sales from U.S. companies. 121 Among the U.S. 

systems that South Korea is acquiring or has recen tly acquired are Lockheed Martin F -35 Joint 

Strike Fighters, Boeing ’s P -8 Poseidon aircraft, and Northrup Grumman ’s RQ -4 “Global Hawk ”

unmanned aerial vehicles. 

South Korea has a mature defense industry, advanced in the past decade through industrial 

coll aboration, defense offsets, and targeted efforts to acquire sophisticated technologies and 

expertise. 122 Korea ’s Defense Reform 2 .0 emphasizes increased self -reliance through the 

development of indigenous capabilities by increasing the percentage of funds al located to defense 

research and development (R&D) and maturing the country ’s defense sector, including by 

increasing exports .123 South Korea was the world ’s ninth -largest arms exporter from 2016 to

2020. 124 South Korean firms compete internationally in the arm ored vehicle, shipbuilding, and 

aerospace industries. 125 For example, Lockheed Martin and Korea Aerospace Industries jointly 

developed the T -50 Golden Eagle, a trainer and light fighter aircraft that has been successful on 

the international market and will l ikely compete for the U.S. Air Force ’s next trainer aircraft 

contract . Defense News ’s “Top 100” defense companies ranking for 2021 featured four South 

Korean defense companies. 126 South Korea aims to further improve the competitiveness of its 

defense industry, which continues to face challenges like program delays, insufficient 

transparency, and gaps in certain industrial capabilities. 127 

Southeast Asia is a major market for South Korean defense equipment. Rece nt South Korean 

arms sales in the region include FA -50 light aircraft sold to the Philippines, three diesel electric 

attack submarines sold to Indonesia, a frigate sold to Thailand, and six missile surface corvettes 

sold to Malaysia. 128 

The 110 th Congress p assed legislation that upgraded South Korea ’s status as an arms purchaser 

from a “Major Non -NATO Ally ” to the “NATO Plus Three ” category ( P.L. 110 -429 ), which has 

subsequen tly become “NATO Plus Five. ” This upgrade increases the threshold for the 

requirement that the U.S. executive branch notify Congress of pending arms sales to South Korea, 

from $14 million to $25 million. Congress has 15 days to consider the sale and take l egislative 

steps to block the sale compared to 30 days for Major Non -NATO Allies. 

ROK ’s Aspirations for Nuclear -Powered Submarines 

For years, South Korean officials —including President Moon and 2022 presidential candidate 

Lee Jae -myung —have voiced an inter est in acquiring or developing nuclear -powered 

submarines. 129 The United States has objected to this, citing proliferation concerns. This ambition 

was raised again after the surprise September 2021 announcement that the United States would 

help Australia dev elop a nuclear -powered submarine capability in cooperation with the United 

Kingdom through the new partnership known as AUKUS (Australia -UK -United States). The U.S. 

willingness to share this sensitive technology led some commentators to argue that South Ko rea, 

as another key ally in the region, should also acquire nuclear -powered attack submarines (SSNs) 

given the DPRK ’s growing capabilities. 130 To achieve this, South Korea would need to either 

develop nuclear naval propulsion technology indigenously or seek agreement with foreign 

suppliers. Such cooperation with the United States would require a new nuclear cooperation

plans to build a type of small modular nuclear reac tor, which could potentially be used to power a

# Bilateral Economic Relations 

South Korea and the United States are major economic partners. Congressional interest in the 

bilateral trade and econom ic relations hip stems from Congress ’ constitutional authority to 

regulate foreign commerce, as well as its interest in how U.S. and South Korean trade and 

investment policies may affect U.S. constituents including consumers, workers, farmers, and 

business owners . In orde r to support bilateral economic relations, in 2011 Congress passed 

legislation to implement the KORUS FTA (P.L. 112 -41 ), which has governed bilateral trade and 

investment ac tivities since 2012 . As Congress conducts its oversight of the Administration, key 

concerns may include enforcement and continued implementation of KORUS FTA commitments, 

effects of continued U.S. unilateral import restrictions on U.S. constituents and bil ateral economic 

relations, and priorities for potential new trade negotiations under the Administration ’s Indo -

Pacific Economic Framework initiative. 

In 2020, two -way goods and services trade between the two countries totaled $155.7 billion, 

making South Korea the United States ’ seventh -largest trading partner, accounting for 3% of total 

U.S. trade. 133 For some western states and U.S. sectors, the South Korean market is even more 

important. South Korea is far more dependent economically on the United States than the United 

States is on South Korea. In terms of goods trade, in 2020, the United States was South Korea ’s

second -largest trading partner (after China), export market, and source of imports. 134 As of 2019 

(latest available), the United States was South Korea ’s second -largest supplier of inward foreign 

direct investment (FDI) and largest destination of outward FDI. 135 

The United States ran a goods trade deficit with South Korea in 2020 of $25.3 billion, the 

difference of $51.4 billion in exports and $76.8 billion in imports, and a services trade surplus of 

$8.1 billion, the difference of $17.8 billion in exports and $9.7 billion in imports ( Table 1). 136 The 

bilateral investment relationship has expanded in recent years due to considerable growth in 

South Korean FDI in the United States, which reached $63.7 billion in 2020, more than triple its 

level in 2011, before the KORUS FTA took effect. U.S. investment in South Korea, by contrast, 

has declined somewhat to $33.9 billion in 2020 from a peak of $40.2 billion in 2017. In 2019 

(latest available), foreign affiliates of U.S. multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in South 

Korea had 115,400 employees, while U. S. affiliates of South Korean MNEs had 94,500 

employees.

(*) The KORUS FTA went into effect on March 15, 2012. 

The United States ’ ec onomic importance to South Korea has declined relative to China, which 

displaced the United States as South Korea ’s top trading partner in 2003. By 2020, China ’s share 

of South Korea ’s trade was roughly double the U.S. share (25% vs. 13%, respectively). 137 China 

also hosts manufacturing facilities for many South Korean multinational firms and the two 

countries trade heavily in intermediate goods, highlighting supply chain linkages. In 2018 (latest 

available), China was the destination for 42% of South Korea ’s intermediate goods exports, 

compared to 8% exported to the United States, the second -largest destination. 138 South Korean 

firms also rely on Chinese origin inputs in their supply chains. The Organisation for Economic 

Co -operation and Development (OECD ) es timates that Chinese origin value -added content in 

South Korean exports doubled from 2005 to 2018, to 5.3%, the largest share of any country —the 

comparable share originating in the United States was 3.6% in 2018. 139 Intensifying U.S. -China

strategic and econ omic competition and U.S. trade restrictions affecting China (e.g., unilateral 

tariffs, export controls), therefore, may have important implications for South Korea ’s economy. 

South Korea ’s export -driven economy and competition with domestic U.S. producers in certain 

products has led to trade friction with the United States of varying intensity over the years. For 

example, imports of certain South Korean products, mostly steel or stainless steel items, as well 

as polyester, chemicals, and washing machines, have been the subject of U.S. antidumping and 

countervailing duty (AD/CVD) investigations. 140 As of November 2021, antidumping duties were 

being collected on 33 South Korean imports (a 50% increase from 2017), and countervailing 

duties were being assessed on seven South Korean products, making South Korea subject to the 

third largest set of such trade remedies among U.S. trade partners, behind China and India. 141 The 

Biden Administration has maintained and, in one case, extended additional Trump -era trade 

restr ictions, including tariffs and quotas, that affected South Korean products (see “U.S. Section 

201 and 232 Import Restrictions Affecting South Korea ”) .

Ten Years of the KORUS FTA (2012 -2022) 

For nearly ten years, the KORUS FTA has been the centerpiece of U.S. -South Korean trade and 

economic relations. 142 The agreement, which entered into force in March 2012, has reduced and 

eliminated tariff and non -tariff bar riers between the two parties on manufactured goods, 

agricultural products, and services. The agreement also provides rules and disciplines on 

investment, intellectual property rights (IPR) and other issues; commits both countries to 

maintain certain worke r and environmental standards; and provides enforceable mechanisms for 

resolving disputes. The second largest U.S. FTA by trade flows after the U.S. -Mexico -Canada 

Agreement (USMCA), the KORUS FTA arguably has some of the most extensive commitments 

of any U .S. FTA in effect. 

Upon implementation, roughly 80% of tariff lines were duty free in U.S. -South Korean trade, 

whereas prior to the KORUS FTA, 38% of U.S. tariff lines and 13% of South Korean tariff lines 

were duty free. Remaining tariffs in bilateral trad e have been largely phased out (roughly 99% of 

all tariff lines) through annual implementation of scheduled tariff cuts. The 10 th round of these 

annual tariff cuts took effect in January 2021. The agreement ’s services trade commitments, 

which are on a “neg ative list ” basis (i.e., they apply to all sectors except those specifically 

exempted), have also expanded U.S. firms ’ access to South Korea ’s services sector. For example, 

in 2017 the third stage of South Korea's market opening to legal services became ef fective, 

allowing U.S. firms to enter into joint ventures in South Korea. 

The KORUS FTA has been modified twice since it was originally negotiated. The agreement was 

initiated in 2006 and signed in 2007 under the George W. Bush and Roh Moo -hyun 

administra tions. Implementing legislation, however, was not submitted to and passed by Congress 

until 2011. This followed negotiations and an exchange of letters by the Obama and Lee Myung -

bak administrations that modified the agreement ’s commitments on auto and agr icultural trade. 143

In 2012, the 2007 agreement as modified by the 2011 exchange of letters took effect for both 

parties. 

In 2018, the Trump and Moon Jae -in administrations negotiated additional modifications to the 

agreement, relating to, among other things , adjusting South Korean regulations affecting U.S. 

auto exports, delaying reduction of the 25% U.S. light truck tariff to 2041, and adding clarifying 

language to the investment provisions. 144 The amendments, which consisted primarily of South 

Korean regulat ory changes and U.S. tariff modifications, took effect in 2019 without action by 

Congress. The KORUS FTA implementing legislation ( P.L. 112 -41 ) provides presidential 

proclam ation authority to modify the U.S. FTA tariff schedule. 

A number of U.S. export sectors may have benefitted from KORUS market openings. For 

example, U.S. beef exports have increased from $686 million in 2011 to $1.7 billion in 2020, as 

the South Korean bee f tariff has fallen from 40% to 16% and will continue declining to zero by 

2026. 145 U.S. motor vehicle and parts exports have nearly tripled from $1.2 billion in 2011 to $3.1 

billion in 2020, such that the United States now exports more cars to South Korea t han to Japan, a 

country with more than twice South Korea ’s population and a larger GDP/capita —though South 

Korea still represents a relatively small share (2.4%) of total U.S. auto exports. 146 South Korea ’s

auto tariff was reduced from 8% to 4% upon KORUS ’s entry into force and eliminated in 2016. 

U.S. exports of services also increased significantly from $17.9 billion in 2011 to $23.4 billion in 

2019, but declines in travel led to a decline in services exports in 2019 to $17.8 billion. 

Attributing changes in trade and investment flows to the KORUS FTA, however, is difficult. Price 

changes due to tariff reductions are only one of a number of factors affecting trade. Fluctuations 

in other factors affecting demand in both countries such as consumer tastes, the b usiness cycle 

and relative growth rates, and exchange rates may play a greater role in determining such 

outcomes. 

Views on the KORUS FTA and its outcomes over its nearly ten -year existence are mixed. 

Proponents argue the FTA has expanded trade (including U .S. exports), investment, competition, 

and consumer choice in both countries, increased U.S. IPR protection in South Korea, and 

improved transparency in South Korea's regulatory process. 147 Some observers also believe the 

agreement has deepened the overall bilateral relationship and spurred South Korea ’s shift to more 

aggressive pursuit of regional trade liberalization initiatives. 148 

Others have argued that the agreement's impact is disappointing, pointing largely to an increase in 

the U.S. trade deficit with South Korea since the agreement took effect —the bilateral deficit on 

goods and services was $4.3 billion in 2011 and $17.2 billion in 2020. 149 During this time, the 

deficit has fluctuated, growing significantly early on and then declining more recently unti l it

roughly doubled in 2020 during the pandemic ( Table 1). Much of the growth in the trade deficit 

stems from auto trade: U.S. goods imports from South K orea increased by $19.2 billion from 

2011 to 2020, with auto and parts imports accounting for $9.0 billion of the increase. However, 

U.S. auto imports peaked in 2015, before the 2.5% U.S. car tariff was reduced under KORUS, 

leading many economists to disag ree with the view that the FTA contributed to the increase in the 

deficit. 150 For example, using 2015 data, the USITC estimated that the U.S. bilateral deficit would 

have been even larger had the KORUS FTA not been in effect. 151 Economists generally find that 

macroeconomic factors, such as aggregate demand and supply, are the main drivers of bilateral 

trade balances, rather than trade agreements. 152 

Some business groups have raised concerns regarding South Korea ’s implementation of certain 

FTA commitments. The 20 18 modifications, however, include several commitments that seek to 

address such issues. For example, South Korea agreed to new principles for conducting origin 

verifications on U.S. exports, a perennial concern of U.S. business groups, and amended a prici ng 

policy on pharmaceuticals to align with KORUS commitments. In addition, the KORUS FTA 

includes several consultative mechanisms that allow for enhanced bilateral engagement on 

implementation issues. For example, Ambassador Tai in November 2021 highlighte d progress in 

addressing U.S. concerns over South Korea ’s implementation of commitments on cross -border 

data flows for financial services. 153 

Many U.S. stakeholder groups viewed the Trump Administration ’s modifications to the KORUS 

FTA positively. For exampl e, the U.S. auto industry praised the additional efforts to reduce non -

tariff barriers in South Korea, such as the negotiated increase, from 25,000 to 50,000 per 

manufacturer, of annual U.S. auto exports allowed to enter South Korea based solely on U.S. 

sa fety certifications. 154 Proponents of trade liberalization, however, viewed some of the 

modifications negatively, such as the lengthy extension of U.S. light truck tariffs. 155 The USITC 

estimated that the modification in the truck tariffs is unlikely to have m uch effect on the U.S. 

market. 156 

Most trade policy observers disputed the Trump Administration ’s characterization of the 

amendments as a “basic redoing ” of the agreement, arguing that they were relatively minor 

adjustments and unlikely to change the KORUS FTA ’s overall balance of concessions. 157 The 

amendments did not include specific commitments on currency, which some groups had sought. 

They also did not make any changes to the agreement ’s digital trade commitments, which were

States has sought on digital trade issues, such as those included in the USMCA. 

South Korea’s FTA Strategy, RCEP, and CPTPP 

South Korea is a major trading nation with trade accounting for a l arge share of its GDP (37.6% from 2018 -2020, 

compared to 12.8% in the United States), 158  and has made the negotiation of comprehensive and high standard 

FTAs covering goods, services, investment, and rules a key focus of its trade policy. South Korea has ent ered into 

several trade agreements over the past two decades. As of July 2021, South Korea had 17 FTAs in effect, covering 

57 countries, including more recently with the United Kingdom and five countries in Central America; it has 

concluded but not yet rat ified negotiations on four additional agreements; and negotiations were ongoing on eight 

new or updated agreements, including with Mercosur, the South America trading bloc that includes Argentina, 

Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. South Korea’s trade agreemen ts include several of its major trading partners, such 

as the United States, China, and the European Union. 159 

South Korea is also a member of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) trade agreement, 

which it signed in November 2020. 160  RCEP, wh ich entered into force for South Korea in February 2022, is of 

particular interest to policymakers given its broad membership of 15 East, Southeast Asian, and Australasian 

countries, including South Korea, China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, and the ten  members of the Association of 

Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). South Korea is not currently participating in the other major Asia -Pacific 

regional trade initiative, the 11 -member Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans -Pacific Partnership 

(CPTPP) . However, in December 2021, Moon’s government publicly announced its intention to take the domestic 

procedural steps necessary to formally apply for CPTPP membership, preferably before Moon leaves office in May 

2022. 161  CPTPP is the agreement that replaced  the Trans -Pacific Partnership (TPP), following the Trump 

Administration’s withdrawal of the United States signature from the proposed TPP in 2017. 

Some stakeholders in the United States, including several Members of Congress, have urged the Biden 

Administr ation to reconsider potential U.S. participation in CPTPP, but U.S. officials have stated the 

Administration does not intend to pursue CPTPP membership at present. 162  Participation in CPTPP by both South 

Korea and the United States could serve as a potential  vehicle to update elements of the KORUS FTA, such as on 

digital trade. Proponents of U.S. participation in CPTPP note with concern that China, which is a member of RCEP 

and has formally applied to join CPTPP, has taken a more active approach to regional t rade agreement 

negotiations than the United States. 163  In contrast to RCEP, CPTPP includes several U.S. -priority commitments, 

such as labor and environmental protections, nearly comprehensive tariff elimination, and enforceable disciplines 

on state -owned ent erprises (SOEs) and digital trade. 

U.S. Section 201 and 232 Import Restrictions Affecting South Korea 

The Trump Administration imposed unilateral tariff increases and other import restrictions on 

several significant U.S. imports from South Korea, which remain in place to date under the Biden 

Administration. 164 In March 2018, President Trump announced tariffs of 25% and 10% on certain

U.S. steel and aluminum imports, respectively. 165 The tariffs were imposed under Section 232 of 

the Trade Expansion Act of 196 2, on the premise that such imports threatened to impair U.S. 

national security, and drew criticism from South Korea, given its close security relationship with 

the United States. In 2017, prior to the implementation of the new trade restrictions, South Ko rea 

was the third -largest supplier of relevant U.S. steel imports ($2.8 billion), but was not a major 

supplier of aluminum ($112 million). 

South Korea, which was negotiating modifications to the KORUS FTA at the time the tariffs were 

announced, decided to negotiate a quota arrangement with the Trump Administration, in lieu of 

the tariffs on steel. The resulting quota arrangement reached between the two sides limits South 

Korean steel exports to the United States to 70% of their average annual quantity duri ng 2015 -

2017. 166 More recently, the Biden Administration has negotiated quota arrangements with the 

European Union and Japan in exchange for lifting the Section 232 steel tariffs on these trade 

partners. 167 The EU and Japan arrangements are less restrictive in some respects, than the quota 

arrangement with South Korea. For example, these arrangements are in the form of tariff -rate 

quotas, whereby imports above the quota allotments are allowed but face a higher tariff. The 

quota arrangement with South Korea, by contrast, does not allow for imp orts above the quota 

level. During a visit to Washington , DC in January 2022 , South Korea ’s trade minister suggested 

the Moon administration was seeking a renegotiation of its steel -quota arrangement. 168 

South Korea did not ne gotiate a quota deal on aluminum and remains subject to the 10% 

aluminum tariffs. In 2020, steel and aluminum imports from South Korea were worth $1.5 billion 

and $214 million, respectively. 

South Korean exports of washing machines and solar panels are als o subject to additional 

temporary U.S. tariffs. 169 President Trump imposed these safeguard tariffs in 2018, based on 

recommendations from the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), under Section 201 of the 

Trade Act of 1974, to address serious or threate ned serious injury from such imports to domestic 

industries. 170 In 2017, prior to the tariffs, South Korea was the third -largest source of U.S. 

washing machine imports ($303 million) and the second -largest source of U.S. solar panel 

imports ($1.1 billion). In 2020, washing machine and solar panel imports from South Korea were 

worth $198 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. 

South Korea notified the WTO of its right to retaliate in response to these safeguard measures. 171 

In line with WTO commitments on safegu ard actions, this retaliation was to begin in 2021, but it

appears that South Korea has not applied any retaliatory measures to date. South Korea also 

initiated WTO dispute settlement procedures as a complainant with regard to both of the U.S. 

Section 201 tariff measures. In early 2022, a WTO panel ruled that some aspects of the U.S. 

Section 201 import restrictions on washing machines violate WTO commitments. 172 Resolving 

the dispute through the WTO dispute -settlement process may be challenging given vacancie s on 

the WTO ’s appellate body, which have resulted in the appellate body ceasing to function. 173 

In May 2019, President Trump also declared auto and auto parts imports a national security 

threat, following another Section 232 investigation by the Commerce De partment. This provided 

the President with authority to impose unilateral tariffs on automobile imports, including imports 

from South Korea. 174 President Trump never imposed additional auto tariffs, but the prospect of 

the tariffs added tension and uncertain ty in the bilateral relationship. South Korean officials 

expressed frustration at the threatened tariffs, particularly given the recent negotiation of the 

KORUS FTA modifications and what they viewed as significant South Korean concessions on 

auto issues, such as the extension of the U.S. light truck tariff. 175 

Biden Administration officials have stated that unilateral tariffs are a legitimate and at times 

necessary U.S. trade policy tool 176 and the Administration appears to have no intent currently to 

remove t he existing import restrictions affecting South Korea. 177 The Section 201 tariffs are time 

limited up to a total duration of eight years. President Trump extended the washing machine 

tariffs through February 2023 and President Biden recently extended the sol ar tariffs , with some 

modification, through February 2026 .178 The Section 232 import restrictions are not time limited 

and will remain in place unless the President takes action to remove them. While some domestic 

U.S. producers of competing products support the tariff actions on steel, aluminum, solar panels, 

and washing machines, downstream U.S. industries and retailers argue the tariffs raise costs in the 

United States, which are ultimately passed to consumers and have argued that removing the tariffs 

coul d also be a potential tool to lower costs for U.S. consumers. 179

Currency Issues 

South Korean exchange rate policies periodically have been a source of consternation in bilateral 

relations. Some observers argue that South Korea has at times artificially depr essed the value of 

the South Korean won in order to gain a trade advantage by making its exports cheaper in other 

countries ’ markets. 180 Given its dependence on international trade, South Korea ’s economy can be 

significantly affected by fluctuations in curre ncy valuations. The U.S. Department of the Treasury 

(Treasury) monitors the foreign exchange policies of major U.S. trading partners and reports to 

Congress on its findings semi -annually. 181 

Pursuant to the Trade Facilitation and Enforcement Act of 2015, this semi -annual report considers 

three criteria to determine whether foreign countries ’ policies warrant more intensive engagement 

by Treasury. These criteria include (1) a significant (at le ast $20 billion) bilateral trade surplus 

with the United States; (2) a material (in excess of 2% of GDP) current account surplus; and (3) 

persistent (occurring in six of 12 prior months) net purchases of foreign currency totaling at least 

2% of GDP. Having had large bilateral and current account surpluses with the United States for 

several years, South Korea has met two of the three criteria during every reporting period except 

one since April 2016, and has remained on Treasury ’s Monitoring List of countrie s meriting close 

attention. 182 

In its April 2021 report to Congress, Treasury noted that in 2020, South Korea also engaged in 

foreign exchange transactions in an effort to limit appreciation of the won —a potential violation 

of the third monitoring criteria. 183 However, the scale of these transactions, which Treasury 

estimated ranged from $5 billion to $21.1 billion, remained under the 2% of GDP threshold 

required to trigger greater engagement by Treasury. The report urged South Korea to limit its 

currency inter ventions “to only exceptional circumstances of disorderly market conditions. ”184 

Some economists, however, argue that Treasury ’s analysis of South Korea ’s foreign exchange 

transactions in 2020 was too narrow and found, using a broader definition of such tran sactions, 

that South Korea did manipulate its currency for a trade advantage. 185 Since 2018, South Korea 

has publicly reported on its foreign exchange transactions. The United States had long urged 

greater transparency in such transactions, and the Trump Adm inistration stated that it reached an 

agreement with South Korea to this effect on the sidelines of the negotiations to modify the 

KORUS FTA. 186

South Korea ’s Domestic Economy 

In 2020, South Korea ’s economy contracted by 0.9%, one of the mildest contractions among 

advanced economies during the global pandemic -induced recession. 187 The economy benefitted 

from the government ’s ability to control the domestic spread of COVID -19 with minimal 

business lockdowns, supportive fiscal and monetary policy, and a sharp rebound in global 

demand for major South Korean exports. Despite the Moon Administration ’s relative success in 

moderating the economic fallout from the pandemic, the Administration has faced criticism over 

its broader economic reform agenda and So uth Korea continues to face a number of long -term 

economic challenges, including growing concerns over income and wealth inequality. 188 

The country experienced a dramatic shift in its economic trajectory over the past several decades. 

South Korea ’s economy expanded rapidly in the decades following the Korean War (1960s -

1980s), during which it transformed from a largely agrarian to a modern industrialized economy. 

Although the country suffered a setback during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, it 

pursued significant economic reforms, which helped it weather the global financial crisis in the 

late 2000s and avoid the deep recessions experienced in most advanced economies. 189 In 1990, 

South Korean gross domestic product (GDP)/capita was roughly one -thi rd of the level in the 

United States, and by 2010, South Korea had closed this gap by half. 190 However, during the last 

decade South Korea experienced a significant growth slowdown. Ten -year average annual GDP 

growth in South Korea fell from 7.2% during the 1990s to 4.7% in the 2000s to 2.6% in the 2010s 

(Figure 5). 

Demographic Challenges 191 

Economists point to a number of reforms that could potentially accele rate the country ’s economic 

outlook. Two of the most fundamental challenges the country faces are its shrinking and rapidly 

ageing population. South Korea ’s population declined in 2020, for the first time on record. 192 At 

0.84 children per woman in 2020, the nation has the world ’s lowest birthrate, which has trended 

further below the replacement rate of 2.1 since the early 1980s. 193 Despite efforts to encourage 

childbirth by successive governments, the rate has steadily declined, falling in each year of the 

Moo n administration and by 20% from 2017 (1.05) to 2020 (0.84). 194 Women in South Korea face 

a number of challenges in juggling a career and childcare, and receive significant pay disparities 

relative to men, with compensation 32.5% below men on average —the lar gest gap in the 

OECD. 195 A shrinking population poses economic challenges, ranging from labor market

slowing economic growth. 196

Compounding these difficulties, South Korea has become the fastest ageing  population  among 

higher -income economies.  Unless this demographic trend  is  reversed or moderated, a shrinking 

working age population will have to support a growing number of retirees, placing increasing 

strain on the country ’s finances.  In 2019, the  OECD  estimated  that South Korea ’s dependency 

ratio (the number of people older th an 65 per 100 people of working age) will grow from roughly 

20% today to nearly 90% by 2060 and will outpace Japan (with a ratio estimated at 80% in 

2060). 197  Poverty among the elderly population is already a major concern and the highest among 

OECD countrie s at 43% in 2018. 198 

In light of its demographic challenges, a key potential method for boosting economic growth in 

South Korea is to increase the country ’s productivity per worker. As of 2017, South Korea ’s

GDP/hour worked was near the bottom of OECD countr ies, on par with Greece and roughly half 

that of the United States, suggesting considerable potential for improvement. 199 Some observers 

argue that greater investment in emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence, could be

critical to improving South Korean labor productivity and easing the fiscal burdens, such as on 

healthcare, of its ageing population. 200 

Bifurcated Industrial Structure and Labor Market 

While the country is home to some of the world ’s most innovative companies, a vast divide ex ists 

between these firms and those that employ the majority of the workforce. On one side of this split 

are the country ’s largest, export -oriented and globally competitive firms (often family -run 

conglomerates called chaebol ), which are typically in the ma nufacturing sector. On the other side 

of this divide are South Korea ’s small firms, which are concentrated in the services sector and 

tend to be domestically oriented, and less productive. According to one study, value added per 

worker in the services sect or, which employs three -quarters of the workforce, is roughly half that 

in the manufacturing sector. 201 The IMF has called for reforms, including easing barriers to entry 

and simplifying the regulatory processes, to encourage a more dynamic business environm ent that 

better equips young small firms to expand, and to boost productivity among services firms. 202 

A related challenge is the duality of the South Korean labor market. Strong labor protections and 

benefits packages for regular workers give firms an ince ntive to hire non -regular or temporary 

workers, who are easily fired and have fewer benefits. Non -regular workers, who account for 

roughly one -third of the salaried workforce, receive lower compensation (roughly two -thirds the 

level of regular workers), de spite reportedly similar skill levels, and once in such positions, the 

probability of transitioning to regular employment is low, with fewer opportunities to upgrade 

skills. 203 The elderly, young, and women are heavily over -represented among non -regular 

work ers. The pandemic recession exacerbated South Korea ’s labor market disparities, with non -

regular workers facing the greatest share of layoffs. 204 As the country recovers from the 

pandemic, there are growing concerns that employment increases have been concen trated in non -

regular employment, including for college -educated workers. 205 In addition to addressing 

concerns over fairness, many economists argue that greater flexibility in the labor market could 

help boost productivity by, for example, encouraging lifel ong acquisition of new skills. 206 

Increasing Housing Costs and Widening Inequality 

Other economic concerns include rapidly rising housing costs and related growth in household 

debt levels, especially during the pandemic. Average home prices in the Seoul metr opolitan area, 

where the majority of the population lives, have doubled over the past five years, despite a variety 

of measures by the Moon government to deter price growth. These prices are now equal to 18 

times the median household income. 207 Home prices s urged 13% this year to August 2021, the

fastest rate of growth in 15 years. 208 At 201% of disposable income, household debt levels in 

South Korea are among the highest in the OECD and roughly twice that of the United States. 209 

The Bank of Korea cited concerns over the growth in household debt and property prices in its 

August 2021 determination to raise South Korea ’s base interest rate to 0.75%. 210 

These various challenges have led to societal tensions over wealth and income inequality and 

privileges of the elit e class. The Moon administration came to power in the aftermath of the South 

Korean public ’s outrage at former -President Park ’s corruption scandal, which included special 

treatment for politically connected families. The activities and employment patterns of the 

chaebol contribute to narratives about unfairness and inequality in the economic system, as a 

small share of South Koreans (roughly 12%) enjoy the high wages and benefits associated with 

employment at these large firms. 211 At the same time, a history of direct and indirect state support 

helped the chaebol to achieve their dominant position in the country ’s economy (e.g., Hyundai 

and its subsidiary Kia account for 80% of domestic auto sales). 212 Corruption and illicit activity 

among chaebol leaders, who o ften face relatively lenient sentences if convicted, is another 

concern —Samsung ’s head, for example, was convicted of bribery related to the impeachment of 

former President Park Geun -hye. 213 Some critics of chaebol privileges argue that reforms to 

address their concentration of economic and political power may be fundamental to improving 

South Korea ’s economic outlook. 214 

Addressing inequality and delivering more inclusive economic growth has been the central 

economi c focus of President Moon ’s tenure, in addition to pandemic recovery. The Moon 

administration has implemented a number of key reforms, particularly in the labor market, 

including multiple yearly increases to the minimum wage (totaling roughly 30%), a statu tory limit 

to weekly working hours, and a boost in government hiring. As in the United States, there is 

intense debate in South Korea over the appropriate reforms to improve economic outcomes for 

low -income households, and many in South Korea have been cri tical of the Moon 

administration ’s policies. Critics point to lackluster economic growth and widening income 

inequality metrics in arguing that President Moon has failed to address the core challenges in the 

economy, and instead urge greater focus on spurr ing productivity through innovation and greater 

flexibility in the labor market. 215 

The Korean New Deal 

More recently, in mid -2020, the Moon administration announced a Korean New Deal agenda that 

includes greater government investment in digital technology and green growth industries with 

planned associated investment by the private sector. Some observers saw this new economic 

framework as an attempt to address the criticisms of the government ’s income -driven growth

policies. 216 In 2021, President Moon broaden ed this agenda with more funding toward the social 

safety net and efforts to stimulate economic activity outside of Seoul. 217 South Korea ’s social 

welfare spending, at 12.2% of GDP in 2019, is among the lowest of advanced economies, with 

only Turkey (12%), C hile (11.4%), and Mexico (7.5%) spending less as share of economic output 

among OECD members. 218 Given the short time remaining in the Moon administration, the 

success of these Korean New Deal initiatives may depend largely on cooperation and 

continuation by the private sector and the policies of South Korea ’s next administration. 

# Nuclear Energy and Nonp roliferation Cooperation 

The United States and South Korea have cooperated in the peaceful use of nuclear energy since 

the 1950s .219 This cooperation includes c ommercial power reactor projects as well as research and 

development work on safety, safeguards, advanced nuclear reactors, and fuel cycle technologies .

In the ir May 2021 Joint Summit statement, the two Presidents reaffirmed “that close coordination 

on all matters related to global nonproliferation and safe, secure, and safeguarded uses of nuclear 

technology remain key characteristics of the alliance, and the United States recognizes the ROK ’s

global role in promoting nonproliferation efforts. ”220 They pledge d to “develop cooperation in 

overseas nuclear markets, including joint participation in nuclear power plant projects. ” The 

High -Level Bilateral C ommission (HLBC) on nuclear energy provides a forum for strategic 

dialogue and technical exchanges, especially regarding spent fuel management, the promotion of 

nuclear exports and export control cooperation, assured fuel supply, and nuclear security. 221 

Nuclear power constitutes approximately one -third of South Korea ’s electricity. 222 The South 

Korean government is planning a phase out for nuclear energy by 2040, partly reflecting concern 

by the public about safety issues related to nuclear energy as a whole . At the same time, South 

Korea is a new exporter of nuclear power plants, with Korea Electric Power Company (KEPCO) 

completing construction of the first of four AP1400 reactors in the United Arab Emirates in 2018. 

Some argue that closer U.S. -ROK cooperation in nuclear reactor exports could revitalize the 

nuclear industries in both c ountries. 223 Others see the two countries as possible competitors for 

future contracts such as in Saudi Arabia. Advances in small modular reactor (SMR) designs in 

both countries are a growing area of cooperation between U.S. and South Korean companies. 224 

Sout h Korea is a non -nuclear -weapon State Party to the nuclear Non -Proliferation Treaty (NPT) 

and has IAEA safeguards , including the Additional Protocol, on its nuclear facilities. South Korea

is also a member of the Nuclear Suppliers ’ Group (NSG), which contr ols sensitive nuclear 

technology trade . Further strengthening its nonproliferation commitments, at the May 2021 

summit, South Korea agreed to “adopt a common policy with the United States to require 

recipient countries have an IAEA safeguard agreement Addi tional Protocol in place as a condition 

of supply of nuclear power plants. ”225 

In 2015, t he United States and South Korea renewed the ir bilateral civilian nuclear cooperation or 

“123” agreement following lengthy negotiations and a required congressional review period .226 

The renewed agreement expan ded South Kore a's options for managing its fuel supply and spent 

fuel stocks. It provides “express reciprocal consent rights over any retransfers or subsequent 

reprocessing or enrichment of material subject to the agreement. ”227 It also gives South Korea 

advance permission to ship U.S. -obligated spent fuel overseas for reprocessing into mixed -oxide 

fuel if it chooses to do so. The agreement allows for enrichment up to 20% of fissile uranium -235 

in South Korea, after consultation through the bilateral commission and further written agreement 

by the United States, and also includes U.S. fuel supply assurances. 228 

The United States and South Korea continue joint research and development projects to address 

the disposition of spent fuel stocks . The Korean Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) is 

pursuing a type of reprocessing called “pyroprocessing .” The U.S. and South Korea conduct joint 

R&D on this technology at Idaho National Laboratory. The South Kore an government sought 

broad U.S. approval for pyroprocessing but did not receive it in the 123 agreement 

negotiations. 229 The United States has a long -term nonproliferation policy of discouraging the 

spread of fuel cycle ( enrichment and reprocessing ) technolo gy to new states because they can be 

used to create material for fuel or for nuclear weapons . To help overcome this conflict , the United 

States and South Korea began a 10 -year Joint Fuel Cycle Study on the economics, technical 

feasibility, and nonprolifera tion implications of spent fuel disposition, including 

pyroprocessing. 230 The Joint Study was expected to be completed in 2021, but the results have not 

been officially announced. Critics of pyroprocessing contend that any separation of plutonium

“123” refers to Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act (as amended). The two governments initialed the text of the

enter ed into force on November 25, 2015, after a mandatory congressional review period. Its duration is 20 years, after 

which it automatically will renew for an additional five -year period unless either or both part ies choose to withdraw.

The Atomic Energy Act (as amended) mandates that U.S. nucle ar cooperation agreements require U.S. consent for 

any “alteration in form or content” (to include enrichment or reprocessing) of U.S. -origin material or any material 

processed in a plant containing transferred U.S. nuclear technology.

South Korea does not have an enrichment capability, but was seeking language in the new agreement that would 

open the door to that possibility. Enrichment at low levels can be used for nuclear fuel and would be subject to IAEA 

safeguards. South Korea sought prior consent f or enrichment but did not receive it in the renewed agreement. Instead, 

the agreement provides for the two sides to consider the issue through the High Level Bilateral Commission. The 

current South Korean government plans to phase out nuclear power and has announced no plans for domestic 

enrichment.

# South Korea ’s Regional Relations 

# South Korea -China Relations 

As seen in the “Legislation in the 117 th Congress ” section, many Members see South Korea as a 

partner in dealing with a variety of regional China -related challenges. China ’s rise as an 

economic and military power influences virtually all aspe cts of South Korean foreign and 

economic policy. Since China ’s 2001 entry into the World Trade Organization, China has 

emerged as South Korea ’s most important economic partner. Over 2 5% of South Korea ’s total 

trade is with China, more than the combined lev el of South Korea ’s trade with the United States 

and Japan, its second and third -largest trade partners. For years, China has been the number one 

location for South Korean firms ’ foreign direct investment, and the two countries signed a 

bilateral FTA in 20 15. Yet, even as China is an important source of South Korean economic 

growth, it also looms large as an economic competitor. Fears of increased competition with 

Chinese enterprises have been an important motivator for South Korea ’s push to negotiate a ser ies 

of FTAs with other major trading partners around the globe. 

Beijing has punished ROK companies when it disagrees with Seoul ’s policy decisions. Perhaps 

the most notable example occurred following Seoul ’s 2016 decision to deploy a U.S. THAAD 

missile de fense battery. China responded by enacting measures that have cost ROK companies 

billions of dollars. Tensions were reduced after South Korea announced in October 2017 that it 

had no intention of deploying additional THAAD batteries, was not seeking to joi n the United 

States ’ missile defense network, and would not enter into a trilateral military alliance with the 

United States and Japan. 232 Many South Korean officials and analysts criticize the United States 

for not doing more to support Seoul in its ensuing struggle with Beijing over the issue. 

Additionally, North Korea ’s dependence on China has grown: since 2017, China has accounted 

for over 90% of North Korea ’s trade with the world and shielded North Korea from additional 

sanctions at the UNSC. Therefore, South Korea must increasingly factor Beijing ’s actions and 

intentions into its North Korea policy. Chinese support or opposition could be decisive in shaping 

the outcome of South Korea ’s approaches to North Korea, both in the short term (such as 

handling sudden crises) and the long term (such as contemplating how to bring about

reunification). During a December 2021 visit to Australia, President Moon summarized the 

context for his approach to China: 

First of all, in terms of our alliance with the US, it's the basis of our diplomacy as well as 

security affairs, and in terms of the economic relationship, of course, the relationship with 

China is important. However, Korea has another factor to take into account, and that has 

to do with the peace and security o n the Korean Peninsula. And it's also denuclearisation 

of DPRK. We need the constructive efforts of China to enable denuclearisation of DPRK. 

Therefore, Korea is focused on the steadfast alliance with the US and also with China. We 

want a harmonised relati onship and we want to maintain such a relationship, and we will 

be putting in the efforts to make this happen. 233 

Partially due to these factors, South Korean officials generally are reluctant to raise objections i n

public about PRC behavior that does not di rectly affect South Korea , particularly on issues such 

as human rights, the South China Sea, or Taiwan . However, many South Korean and U.S. 

analysts have noticed a rise in negative attitudes towards China among South Korean s since the 

2016 THAAD incident, as well as increased tensions between the two countries over PRC 

fishermen ’s alleged incursions into and over -fishing of South Korean waters. Many South 

Koreans also have publicly expressed displeasure that in recent years the PRC has attempted to 

appropri ate Korean cultural and culinary products, such as kimchi , as well as a perceived PRC 

campaign to lay claim to ancient kingdoms on the Korean Peninsula that Koreans regard as part 

of their national history .234 According to a 2020 Pew Research Center poll, the PRC has replaced 

Japan as the country South Koreans regard most unfavorably. Pew found that n egative views 

toward the PRC have been particularly notable among South Koreans in their 20s and 30s; among 

the 1 4 countries surveyed, South Korea was the only country in which younger people held more 

unfavorable views toward China than previous generations. 235 These shifts in public opinion may 

partly explain Moon ’s willingness to allow more PRC -relevant phrases to a ppear in the Biden -

Moon May 2021 joint statement than is typical of U.S. -ROK statements. 

Moon ’s government has taken an ambiguous stance on whether to cooperate with the 

Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (“the Quad ”), a cooperative forum that includes Austr alia, India, 

Japan, and the United Stat es. Seoul ’s participation in Quad activities may be more likely after the 

Biden Administration dropped the previous U.S. framing of the group as anti -China and led the 

creation of new Quad initiatives on COVID -19 vacc ine distribution, climate change, and critical 

technologies. South Korea has comparable bilateral projects with the United States and several 

other countries, creating the potential for expanded explicit or unofficial cooperation with the 

Quad programs. 

Ma ny observers and policymakers have recommended the U.S. reorient its defense strategy, 

posture, and presence in the Indo -Pacific to more directly address potential military challenges by 

China. To this end, section 1251 of the FY2021 NDAA authorized the es tablishment of a Pacific 

Deterrence Initiative to establish, oversee, and fund a long -term strategy to deter Chinese military 

aggression in the Indo -Pacific and “to carry out prioritized activities to enhance the United States 

deterrence and defense postur e in the Indo -Pacific region, assure allies and partners, and increase 

capability and readiness in the Indo -Pacific region. ” As Members of Congress continue to 

advance the Pacific Deterrence Initiative (for which the FY2022 NDAA authorized additional 

fundi ng) and seek to shape U.S. military responses to China in the Indo -Pacific, they may

Peninsula and U.S. -ROK relations more generally. 

# South Korea -Japan Relations 

South Korea ’s t ies with Japan are perennially fraught and U.S. policy makers have long 

encouraged enhanced South Korea -Japan relations. For over a decade, some Members of 

Congress have expressed support for deeper U.S. -ROK -Japan cooperation and concern when 

relations between Seoul and Tokyo have taken a downturn. 236 A cooperative relationship between 

the two countries, both U.S. treaty allies, and among the three benefits U.S. interests because it 

arguably enhances regional stability, helps coordination over N orth Korea policy, and boosts each 

country ’s ability to deal with the strategic challenges posed by China ’s rise. However , bilateral 

mistrust between Seoul and Tokyo has deepened over the past half -decade. Domestic political 

dynamics in both countries ofte n exact a political cost to those who advocate steps that would 

help assuage the concerns of the other side and reward those who take a confrontational stance. 

As a result, South Korea –Japan relations often suffer from strategic neglect in both capitals. 237 

Among the causes of bilateral friction are the two countries ’ competing claims to the small 

Dokdo/Takeshima islands in the Sea of Japan (c alled the East Sea by Koreans). Another major 

source of tension is South Korean complain ts that Japan has not adequately acknowledged its 

history of aggression against Korea. 238 For more than three generations beginning in the late 19 th 

century, Japan intervened directly in Korean affairs, culminating in the annexation of the Korean 

peninsula in 1910. Over the next 35 years, Imperial Japan all but attempted to subjugate Korean 

culture. 239 Among the victims were tens of thousands 240 of South Korean “comfort women ” who 

during the 1930s and 1940s were brought into , many if not most by coercive measures, a system 

of facilities that provid ed sexual services for Japanese soldiers throughout the Imperial Japanese 

Empire . When South Koreans perceive that Japanese officials are downplaying or denying this 

history, it becomes difficult for South Korean leaders t o support initiatives to institutionalize 

improvements in bilateral ties.

For example, in February 2019, when South Korea -Japan relations were entering a particularly 

tense phase, a bipartisan, bicameral group of lawmakers, including the chair s and ranking 

members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and Senate Foreign Relati ons Committee, co -

sponsored a resolution (H.Res. 127 and S.Res. 67 , 116 th Congress) affirming the importance of

“Comfort Women” -Related Legislation  in U.S. Congress 

In the past, t he U.S. House of Representatives has taken an interest in the comfort women issue. In the 109 th 

Congress,  H.Res. 759  was passed by the House International Relations Committee on September 13, 2006, but 

was not voted on by the full House. In the 110 th  Congress,  H.Res. 121 , with 167 co -sponsors, was passed in the 

House on July 30, 2007, by voice vote. This resolution expresse d the sense of the House that Japan should 

“formally acknowledge, apologize, and accept historical  responsibility in a clear and unequivocal manner” for its 

abuses of the comfort women. The text of the resolution calls the system “unprecedented in its cruelty” and “one 

of the largest cases of human trafficking in the 20 th  century,” asserts that some Jap anese textbooks attempt to 

downplay this and other war crimes, and states that some Japanese officials have tried to dilute the  1993  Kono 

Statement , a document issued by then -Chief Cabinet Secretary Yohei Kono that apologized to the victims and 

admitted re sponsibility by the Japanese military . In the 113 th  Congress, the 2014 Consolidated Appropriations Act 

(P.L. 113 -76 , H.R. 3547 ) indirectly referred to  H.Res. 121 . P.L. 113 -76 ’s conference committee issued a Joint 

Explanatory Statement that called on Federal Agencies to implement directives contained in the July 2013  H.Rept. 

113 -185 , which in turn “urge[d] the Secretary of State to encourage the Government of Japan to address the 

issues raised” in  H.Res. 121 .

Relations have been particularly tense in recent years, following four events in the 2018 -19 

period: Moon ’s steps to effectively terminate a 2015 ROK -Japan agreement on comfort women; 

South Korean Supreme Court rulings that Japanese firms should compensate South Koreans for 

forced labor during Japan ’s occupation; Japan ’s June 2019 imposition of procedural hurdles on 

exports to South Korea of key technology materials; and South Korea ’s August 2019 decision to 

abandon a ROK -Japan military intelligence -sharing pact. This final mo ve threatened to further 

erode U.S. -ROK -Japan security cooperation until, under heavy U.S. pressure, Seoul in November 

2019 agreed to delay its withdrawal from the agreement. Many analysts criticized the Trump 

Administration for not intervening earlier to prevent ROK -Japan relations from deteriorating. The 

Biden Administration has emphasized the importance of trilateral cooperation and has convened a 

number of high -level trilateral meetings, generally focused on dealing with North Korea, though 

U.S. governm ent readouts mention other topics of discussion such as climate change and securing 

supply chains .241 Lingering tensions between the two sides, however, have prevented them from 

holding a bilateral summit since 2019. The Administration ’s February 2022 Indo -Pacific strategy 

states that one of its ten “core lines of effort ” is “expand[ing] U.S. -Japan -ROK cooperation, ” to 

include not only North Korea -related matters, but also regional development and infrastructure, 

critical technology and supply -chain issues, and women ’s leadership and empowerment .

“Increasingly, ” the strategy says, “we will seek to coordinate our regional strategies in a trilateral 

context. ”242 

# South Korea -Burma (Myanmar) Relations 243 

Following the Burmese military ’s F ebruary 2021 seizure of polit ical power, the South Korean 

government called for the restoration of democracy and t he South Korean National Assembly 

passed a resolution condemning the junta ’s actions . President Moon and other senior officials 

issued particularly vocal condemnations of the junta ’s violent suppression of protestors. They 

cited parallels to a seminal moment in modern South Korean history, a May 1980 incident in the 

South Korean city of Gwangju, where the South Korean military government cracked down 

against a pro -democracy uprising, killing at least hundreds and perhaps thousands of protestors. 244

South Korea suspended new defense exchange s and cooperation with Burma, including the 

export of military supplies . It also extended the visa status of all Burma nationals residing i n

South Korea until peace is restored in Burma , and is reassessing development corporation 

projects, though has agreed to continue projects that would directly affect livelihood and 

humanitarian aid assistance in Burma. 245 In their May 2021 joint statement, Biden and Moon 

condemned the actions of the Burmese military, known as the Tatmadaw. In November, the two 

countries joined with Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Norway, and the United Kingdom to 

condemn the Tatmadaw for its “ongoing human rights violations and abuses .” 246 

Prior to the 2021 coup, South Korean investment into Burma had increased significantly over the 

previous decade. South Korea also significantly increased its Official Development Assistance 

(ODA) to Burma since the middle of the past decade. After providing an estimated $44 million in 

total ODA to Burma from 2010 -2014, South Korea increased its aid disbursements to 

approximately $260 million in the 2015 -19 period. 247  In comparison, South Korea provided over 

$1.7 billion and $1.9 billion to all of ASEAN countries excluding Brunei, over the 2010 -14 and 

2015 -2019 periods, respectively. 

Prior to the February 2021 coup, South Korea was one of Burma ’s top -ten trade and inv estment 

partners, largely importing agricultural goods, apparel goods, rubber, and aluminum scraps, and 

exporting heavy construction material, commercial and transport cars, medical goods, and 

cosmetic goods. 248 Between 1988 and 2017, Burma reportedly attrac ted $71 billion in foreign 

direct investment, with South Korea accounting for 5% of the total. 249 Between 2018 and 2021, 

South Korea ’s largest investment sectors in Burma by number of corporations were 

manufacturing; wholesale retail; financial and insurance ; and professional, scientific, technical 

services. 250 By value, the bulk of the investments was largely in the mining and financial sectors, 

followed by manufacturing.

the four major powers (the United S tates, China, Japan and Russia), ” primarily by expa nding 

economic ties, people -to -people exchanges, and cooperation in non -traditional security areas such 

as supply chain resiliency and global health. 252 The effort, named the “New Southern Policy ”

(NSP), fits with Moon ’s overall goal of increasing South Kore a’s strategic autonomy and 

overlaps with parts of the United States ’ approach to the Indo -Pacific over the past several years. 

The NSP represents an attempt to diversify South Korea economically away from China, take 

advantage of Southeast Asia ’s and India ’s growing economic importance, and expand South 

Korea ’s strategic flexibility, particularly amidst rising rivalry between the United States and 

China. A further goal was to solidify the recipients ’ support for Moon ’s goals toward North 

Korea. 253 

Within two years after unveiling the New Southern Policy, Moon visited India and became the 

first South Korean president to visit all ten ASEAN members. Under the New Southern NSP, his 

government expanded the government ’s bureaucratic resources devoted to Southeast Asia, 

announced a plan to more than double overseas development assistance to ASEAN countries by 

2023, and concluded or began negotiating upgrades to multiple trade agreements with India and 

Southeast Asian countries. The New Southern Policy emphasized the role South Korea could play 

in helping Southeast Asian countries and India deal with non -traditional security issues such as 

maritime security, terrorism, cyber security, natural disas ters and climate change. In 2020, 

Moon ’s government launched the “New S outhern Policy Plus, ” which expanded public health 

assistance, particularly COVID -19 -related items. 254 

Moon ’s New Southern Policy overlaps in a number of areas with the Indo -Pacific policies 

pursued by both the Trump and Biden Administrations, including inf rastructure development, 

energy, pandemic response, and cybersecurity. Since at least 2019, the Washington , DC and Seoul 

have attempted to create linkages between their two approaches, signing multiple MOUs, holding 

a number of meetings to discuss coordina tion, and launching some small -scale joint projects in 

Southeast Asia , such as an anti -corruption program in Indonesia. 255 One 2021 study of U.S. -South 

Korean coordination in Southeast Asia described most coordination as “nascent ” and concluded 

that rather t han pursuing joint efforts with the United States and U.S. -led multi -country

initiatives, South Korea “seems to prefer to focus on complementary, but indepen dent, efforts in 

Southeast Asia. ”256 The most high profile and ambitious joint project, the KORUS Glo bal Vaccine 

Partnership launched by Biden and Moon in May 2021, appears to be an exception to this general 

rule. 

# South Korea ’s Political Structure 

For most of the first four decades after the country was founded in 1948, South Korea was ruled 

by authorita rian governments. Following widespread anti -government protests throughout the 

1980s, the country ’s military rulers in 1987 agreed to allow a new constitution to be written and 

elections to be held. These moves opened the door to a fundamental transformation of the South 

Korean polity into what by most measures is a thriving, robust democracy. Over the past 30 years, 

So uth Korea has conducted seven presidential elections, managed multiple changes in power 

from ruling to opposition party, held elections at all levels of government, and experienced a 

flowering of civil society organizations. Peaceful protests against gover nment policies, protected 

by constitutional guarantees of the freedom of expression, are a regular feature of daily life. South 

Korea ’s unicameral National Assembly has impeached two presidents, one of whom, Park Geun -

hye, was subsequently removed from off ice in March 2017 for corruption by a unanimous 

Constitutional Court ruling that followed massive candlelight protests against her. In December 

2021, Moon pardoned Park, who had defeated him in the 2012 presidential election. 

# A Powerful Executive Branch 

Nominally, power in South Korea is shared by the president and the 300 -member unicameral 

National Assembly. Of these, 253 members represent single -member constituencies. The 

remaining 47 are selected based on proportional voting. National Assembly members are elected 

to four -year terms. The president and the central bureaucracy continue to be the dominant forces 

in South Korean policymaking, as formal and informal limitations prevent the National Assembly 

from initiating major pieces of legislation. Constit utional reforms to reduce the President ’s

powers have been proposed by a succession of governments, most recently by President Moon. 

Neither the previous National Assembly, in office from 2016 -2020, nor the current one have 

advanced these proposals. 257 

# Polit ical Parties 

Presently, there are two major political parties in South Korea . U.S. ties historically have been 

stronger with South Korea ’s conservative parties .

 The Minjoo (Democratic) Party is South Korea ’s largest party and its main 

progressive party. Minjoo has controlled the National Assembly since April 2016 

elections and currently controls the largest majority in the chamber since the 

1987 Constitution was adopted. Minjoo ’s predecessors controlled the Blue House 

from 1998 to 2008, and the National A ssembly from 2004 to 2008 .

 The People Power Party (PPP ) is a conservative grouping and is South Korea ’s

second -largest party. The PPP and its predecessor parties have controlled the 

National Assembly for all but nine of the 33 years since the 1987 Constit ution 

went into effect. Since 2016, however, the main conservative political grouping 

has been in the legislative minority, a reflection of the disarray conservatives 

faced following the Park Geun -hye impeachment. 

# Challenges to Political and Civil Rights in South Korea 

Even amidst South Korea ’s democratic transformation and consolidation, questions have 

persisted about the depth of South Korea ’s democracy. 258 South Korea ’s commitment to 

democracy can appear conditional, with one standard for political allie s of whoever occupies the 

presidential office in the Blue House and another for opponents. In general, South Korean 

conservative (as right -of -center groups are generally referred to South Korea) presidents use the 

executive branch ’s dominant position to ta rget and investigate progressive (left of center) political 

opponents, with the roles reversed during times of progressive rule. Often this dynamic of 

selective suppression centers around North Korea policy, with conservative governments 

attempting to sile nce critics of generally harder line policies toward Pyongyang, and progressive 

governments using its powers to do the same to critics of their pro -engagement policies. 259 

Constitutional, legal, and political checks generally have proven insufficient to stop governments 

of all political stripes from selectively attempting to limit freedom of expression to contain 

political opposition .260 

President Moon, for instance, has been criticized by domestic opponents, as well as non -Korean 

academics and human rights org anizations, for using his powers to selectively dampen freedom of 

speech and expression, particularly against activities and speech that run counter to his 

government ’s pro -engagement policy toward North Korea. 261 Critics have been particularly vocal 

about t he government ’s support for a new law, passed in December 2020, criminalizing the 

sending of material , such as leaflets, into North Korea that are critical of the North Korean regime 

without permission from the Seoul government. 262 

Moon was elected in 2017 in part because he seemed to be a departure from the abuses t hat 

resulted in the impeachment —and later removal from office —of Park Geun -hye ( in power 2013 -

20 17). Park ’s immediate predecessor, fellow conservative Lee Myung -bak (2008 -20 13), also was
