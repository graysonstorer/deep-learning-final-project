# This page was left intentionally blank. 1April 2022 In a year that started with great uncertainty but was buoyed by even greater optimism, the Port Authority of NY & NJ’s airport system again demonstrated its remarkable resiliency in 2021, recovering traffic in earnest following a devastating and tragic 2020 that leveled industries around the world including aviation. Although we are not nearly yet back to where we were before the pandemic, we are certainly traveling the right path. In 2021, the Port Authority of NY & NJ’s four commercial airports – John F. Kennedy International, Newark Liberty International, LaGuardia and New York Stewart International – served more than 75.5 million air passengers, recapturing more than 50 percent of our 2019 record total and close to double the number of passengers we served in 2020, when we lost a staggering 100 million passengers from the previous year. Headwinds persisted throughout 2021. Waves of infections caused by coronavirus variants stalled growth on multiple occasions. A ban on most visitors from overseas was lifted only late in the year. Many workplaces remained in remote mode and cancelled travel and conference plans. As one of the world’s premier centers for business and a top draw for international visitors, our region felt the slump in air travel more keenly than most. We did not enjoy the level of recovery that our airport colleagues in warm-weather destinations did, but neither did we continue to sink. By year’s end, even the air travel sectors that had shown anemic growth in early 2021 were progressing and showing promise of sustained growth and gains. While they are still short of their 2019 passenger levels, the airports run by the Port Authority all delivered outstanding results in 2021 given the circumstances. Rebounding from lows not seen in decades, the airports steadily resumed their usual activity as spring turned to summer. The year culminated in a robust year-end holiday travel season that saw millions of travelers returning to our airports. The recovery has presented a host of challenges, but we have risen to meet them time and again. Our vision to be world-class operators of world-class airports remained undeterred as we leveraged the downturn in traffic to accelerate infrastructure improvements that have delivered several new facilities in the last year, with much more on the near horizon. The transformation of our airports puts us in a position to soar as the anticipated recovery in air travel continues to gain momentum. The attached statistics are used by the Port Authority’s Aviation Department to better understand our airports and the aviation industry, conduct analyses and assist in decision-making as we chart a course for our industry’s recovery. This report remains a continuing reflection of the department’s desire to keep our stakeholders informed and reaffirms our commitment to achieving regional prosperity through a unified system of airport facilities that offer safe and secure environments, excellent customer experience, and environmentally sustainable and world-class services delivered by a world-class staff.

History  

> ■

Construction for a new international airport began in 1942 under a New York City contract on the site of the Idlewild Golf Course in Queens, New York City.  

> ■

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey began operating the soon-to-open airport on June 1, 1947, under a lease with the City of New York.  

> ■

On July 9, 1948, commercial flights began flying into and out of the newly opened New York International Airport.  

> ■

The airport was rededicated John F. Kennedy International Airport on December 24, 1963, in memory of the nation’s 35th president.  

> ■

On February 7, 1964, the Beatles arrived for the first time in the United States and entertained reporters and the public at a press conference in the former International Arrivals Building. Over the decades, the airport has been a gateway for numerous presidents and dignitaries, including thousands who have arrived throughout the years for the annual United Nations General Assembly.  

> ■

In 2000, JFK welcomed its one-billionth passenger.  

> ■

In 2004, the Port Authority and the City of New York concluded an agreement that ensures the agency’s continued operation of JFK through 2050.  

> ■

JFK made airport history on March 19, 2007, when the A380, the world’s largest passenger aircraft, touched down on U.S. soil for the first time in a route-proving test, and again on August 1, 2008, when an Emirates Airline A380 landed at JFK—the first regularly scheduled arrival of the A380 in the United States.  

> ■

In 2018, just five years after JFK surpassed 50 million annual passengers for the first time in its history, it surpassed 60 million. 

Size and Location 

JFK covers 4,930 acres, including 880 acres in the Central Terminal Area. The airport has more than 30 miles of roadway. It is located on Jamaica Bay in the southeastern section of Queens County, New York City, 15 miles by highway from midtown Manhattan. 

Aviation Role 

JFK has been recognized for decades as the premier U.S. gateway for passengers and cargo. JFK is the busiest airport in the New York City metropolitan area, and among the busiest in North America and the world. In 2019, the airport served a record 62.55 million passengers and handled more than 1.3 million tons of cargo. The airport served about 34.3 million international passengers in 2019, also a record and more than any other U.S. airport. In 2021 – a year of ongoing recovery following the sharp decline in air travel worldwide due to the pandemic – JFK served more than 30.7 million passengers and handled nearly 1.54 million tons of cargo. 

Employment and Economic Impact 

About 34,850 people are employed at the airport. The airport contributes about $42 billion in economic activity to the New York-New Jersey metropolitan region, supporting nearly 195,000 total jobs and more than $15.1 billion in annual wages. 

Investment 

The City of New York invested about $150 million in the original construction of the airport. Since then, the Port Authority has invested more than $8.6 billion in JFK. 

Redevelopment 

In January 2017, the Port Authority began master program and planning efforts to transform JFK into a unified, interconnected, world-class airport capable of accommodating as many as 100 million annual passengers by 2050. In April 2021, an agreement was reached with Delta Air Lines and JFK International Air Terminal (JFKIAT), the operator of Terminal 4, to dramatically expand Terminal 4 and consolidate Delta’s operations there. The $1.5 billion project, which is being financed by private capital, was initially authorized by the Port Authority Board in February 2020 as a $3.8 billion expansion and modernization, which was revised due to the impact of the pandemic on air travel. Ground was broken on the project in December 2021. In August 2021, a deal was announced for a new $3.9 billion, 1.2 million square foot Terminal Six, which will anchor the north side of the airport. The project will be undertaken and financed through a public private partnership with JFK Millennium Partners, which is a consortium of Vantage Airport Group, American Triple I Partners, RXR Realty, and JetBlue Airways. The new terminal will connect to JetBlue’s existing Terminal 5 and be equipped with capacity for 10 new gates, as well as bright and airy check-in halls and arrival spaces designed to enhance the customer experience. Customers will enjoy more than 100,000 square feet of commercial dining and retail amenities, lounges, and recreational spaces. Construction of the new terminal is scheduled to begin in mid-2022 and the first new gates are scheduled to open in 2025.

AIRPORT INFRASTRUCTURE 4

John F. Kennedy International Airport 

In December 2021, Governor Kathy Hochul announced that the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had reached a revised agreement with The New Terminal One (NTO), a consortium of financial sponsors, to build a 2.4 million square foot state-of-the-art new international terminal that will anchor the south side of the airport and be able to handle over 20 million customers per year. The $9.5 billion project will be built in phases, and when completed will be the largest international terminal at JFK. Redevelopment work designed to improve the overall customer experience also is underway at Terminal 8, with a total of 70,400 square feet of added space, including 33,000 square feet of public space. Another 57,500 square feet of existing space will be refurbished. New amenities include premium lounges, enhanced baggage systems, premium check-in space, upgraded concessions and five additional wide-body gates. Completion is expected in 2023. More information about the JFK redevelopment program can be found at www.anewjfk.com .

Central Terminal Area 

JFK has six airline terminals surrounded by a dual ring of peripheral taxiways. The original CTA was enlarged from 655 to 880 acres by relocating taxiways to provide needed space for expanding the passenger terminals. There are more than 125 aircraft gates serving the six terminals. The CTA also includes a cogeneration plant that produces the power supply for JFK, and the heating and air conditioning for the entire CTA. 

Terminals  

> ■

Terminal 1: The Terminal One Group, a consortium of airlines – Air France, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, and Lufthansa – built the 11-gate international Terminal 1 on the site of the old Eastern Airlines Terminal. It opened in 1998.  

> ■

Terminal 2: Delta Air Lines operates Terminal 2 and completed the expansion of Terminal 4 during 2013. Delta vacated Terminal 3 when the newly expanded Terminal 4 opened in May 2013. After 50 years of service to JFK, Terminal 3 was demolished. Terminal 3 ramp is now used as an aircraft parking area for 15 planes.  

> ■

Terminal 4: The 1.5-million-square-foot, common-use Terminal 4 opened in May 2001. Terminal 4 includes separate levels for departures and arrivals, consolidated ticketing and baggage operations, improved customer facilities, duty-free retail shops, and a wide variety of eateries. A Welcome Center opened in 2009. Delta Air Lines redeveloped a portion of the terminal by adding nine new gates, and other enhancements and amenities, which opened in 2013.  

> ■

Terminal 5: JetBlue’s Terminal 5 opened in 2008. The Port Authority provided nearly $800 million toward the jointly financed, 26-gate, 635,000-square-foot terminal, which is designed to handle up to 20 million passengers per year. In 2012, JetBlue broke ground on T5i, a 145,000-square-foot expansion to accommodate JetBlue international arrivals. The project was completed at the end of 2014.  

> ■

Terminal 7: A $251 million redevelopment project was completed at British Airways’ Terminal 7. The project expanded and reconfigured the terminal for greater efficiency. Improvements included new ticketing and check-in areas, new retail outlets, and a new departure and arrival roadway system.  

> ■

Terminal 8: American Airlines’ $1.2 billion transformation of Terminal 8 opened in 2007 and serves domestic and international passengers on three concourses. Terminal 8 includes expanded check-in areas, top name-brand shops and eateries, and numerous services. 

Roadway Access and Ground Transportation 

A roadway configuration in the Central Terminal Area divides the roadway network into five terminal areas so motorists can make direct connections between terminals, parking lots, and airport expressways. In addition to AirTrain JFK, the airport also is served by taxis, airport coaches, and several car rental agencies. 

AirTrain JFK 

Opened in 2003, the light-rail system connects JFK with the Long Island Rail Road and New York City subway and bus lines. Recent improvements include digital signage, expanded closed-circuit television, upgraded access control security systems and improved customer communications on-board and in stations. 

Parking 

JFK offers more than 15,000 public parking spaces and includes five garages. E-ZPass Plus, which allows customers to use their E-ZPass to pay for parking, is available in all parking lots and garages, except for the overflow lot. Several customer incentives and conveniences have been implemented, including a reservation system. 

Cargo 

JFK is one of the world’s leading international air cargo centers. The airport offers nearly 4 million square feet of modern, state-of-the-art cargo warehouse and office space. The entire air cargo area is designated as a Foreign-Trade Zone. JFK serves the world’s key air cargo markets through a strong mix of long-haul, direct and nonstop all-cargo aircraft and wide-body passenger aircraft flights.

John F. Kennedy International Airport Runways/Taxiways  

> ■

JFK’s runway system consists of two pairs of parallel runways (4L-22R, 4R-22L and 13L-31R, 13R-31L) aligned at right angles. Total runway length is over nine miles.  

> ■

Three of the airport’s runways are constructed in concrete.  

> ■

All four of the airport’s runways are 200 feet wide to accommodate Aircraft Design Group VI aircraft.  

> ■

All runways have high-intensity runway edge lighting, centerline and taxiway exit lighting, and are grooved to improve skid resistance and minimize hydroplaning.  

> ■

Taxiways total approximately 45 miles in length with widths of 75 feet or 82 feet. There are shoulders and erosion control pavements on each side of the taxiways. Other features include the taxiway centerline light system and a sign system, illuminated at night to provide directional information for taxiing aircraft.  

> ■

The Port Authority invested $200 million for taxiway and airside rehabilitation to prepare for the A380 aircraft, and more than $150 million was dedicated to fund technical and customer service initiatives to combat airport delays.  

> ■

Between 2010 and 2015, the Port Authority invested nearly $600 million to completely reconstruct the two JFK’s departure runways, 13R-31L (Bay Runway) and 4L-22R.  

> ■

Both runways were reconstructed in concrete and were widened from a 150- to 200-foot width to accommodate operations of Design Group VI Aircraft, increase operational efficiencies, and enhance safety. The runways received new entrances for departing aircraft and new high-speed exits for landing aircraft, which enabled swifter departures and easier access from runways to terminal gates, saving time on the ground for all passengers at JFK.  

> ■

In 2017, the Port Authority invested $106 million to rehabilitate Runway 4R-22L, one of the two arrival runways at JFK. The project provided for rehabilitation of the runway pavement, replacement of electrical infrastructure, and realignment of certain taxiways to allow for faster runway exiting after landing and saving taxing time to terminal gates.  

> ■

In 2019, the Port Authority completed a $355 million rehabilitation of JFK other primary arrival runway, 13L-31R, which included the addition of a high-speed taxiway, navigational aids, new energy-efficient lighting, and widening to 200 feet. The project used specialized concrete for long-term durability to minimize future operational impacts. 

Air Traffic Control Tower 

The 321-foot air traffic control tower opened in 1994 and includes communications, radar, and wind shear alert systems. 

Hotel 

The Port Authority completed $20 million in restoration and preservation measures for JFK’s historic TWA Flight Center in advance of an adaptive re-use redevelopment program, which created hotel space and related services in the Central Terminal Area. The 512-room TWA Hotel opened in May 2019. Visit

Size and Location 

Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) occupies 2,027 acres, including a 425-acre Central Terminal Area, at roughly sea-level elevation. It is bordered by the New Jersey Turnpike, Interstate 78 and U.S. Routes 1-9 in the cities of Newark and Elizabeth, N.J. and resides in both the counties of Essex and Union and the cities of Newark and Elizabeth. 

Aviation Role 

EWR is among the busiest North American and international airports. In 2019, EWR served more than 46 million passengers, an all-time record. In 2021 – a year of ongoing recovery following the sharp decline in air travel worldwide due to the pandemic – Newark served more than 29.1 million passengers and handled nearly 800,000 tons of air cargo. 

Employment and Economic Impact 

About 19,250 people are employed at Newark Airport. The airport contributes more than $29.3 billion in annual economic activity to the New York-New Jersey metropolitan region, supporting more than 128,000 total jobs and nearly $10.8 billion in annual wages. 

Investment 

The City of Newark spent more than $8.2 million on the construction and development of Newark Airport, and the U.S. government spent more than $15.1 million prior to 1948. Since assuming the airport’s lease in 1948, the Port Authority has invested more than $7.4 billion at the airport. 

Redevelopment 

A $2.7 billion program is underway to replace Terminal A. The program includes upgraded roadways and airside improvements along with a new parking garage that will include public parking and a consolidated rental car (ConRac) facility. The new, one-million-square-foot, world-class Terminal A will feature 33 common-use gates with a climate-controlled pedestrian bridge providing direct access to AirTrain Newark and the parking facility, along with a more-efficient airside taxi lane network. The terminal will open in 2022. The new parking facility will offer 2,700 public parking spaces and 3,360 rental car spaces to support 10 rental car brands, as well as a separate quick-turnaround garage for rental car maintenance. It is expected to open in phases in 2022 and be fully operational in 2023. 

Central Terminal Area (CTA) 

The 425-acre oval Central Terminal Area was built as part of a large-scale airport redevelopment program in the 1960s and early 1970s. The CTA consists of three passenger terminals: A, B, and C, and a first-class, ten-story, 585-room hotel with meeting rooms, a fitness center, two restaurants and a bar.

Passenger Terminals  

> ■

Construction of Terminal A began in October 1967, and the facility opened in August 1973. With 25 gates, the terminal branches out into three circular satellite buildings. The satellites contain flight departure lounges, and airline and passenger service facilities. The main terminal building measures approximately 800 by 165 feet and includes a Welcome Center. A new terminal and related infrastructure are under construction and will replace the existing terminal beginning in 2022.  

> ■

Terminal B’s modernization expanded the two-level facility into three levels. Highlights include inline baggage screening systems and passenger screening systems, a baggage claim hall, departure areas, ticket counters, additional passenger lounges and concessions, and a Welcome Center. Terminal B has 15 international and 10 domestic gates. In 2019, the Port Authority Board of Commissioners authorized $35 million for vision and master planning initiatives that would allow for the future replacement of Terminal B with a new world-class Terminal B.  

> ■

Terminal C opened in 1988. Continental Airlines’ Global Gateway project in 2001 added 600,000 square feet of space and turned the facility into a three-level terminal with two levels for departures. The terminal has a total of 52 gates, a huge retail and concessions space, and U.S. Customs facilities. The state-of-the-art International Arrivals Facility, also completed by Continental, added another 1,500-passengers-per-hour arrival capacity to Newark Liberty. A Welcome Center also was added. In 2010, Continental merged with United Airlines. 

Newark Liberty International Airport 

The new Terminal A will open in 2022, replacing the existing Terminal A – the airport’s oldest terminal. 

INVESTMENT & REDEVELOPMENT 

Roadways 

To reduce congestion and improve airport access, roadways were widened and reconfigured in the passenger terminal area and airport entrances, giving vehicles the option to bypass terminals and proceed directly to parking areas. 

AirTrain Newark 

AirTrain Newark, the airport’s automated monorail, opened for service on-airport between terminals and parking lots in 1996. The system was extended to a new station on the Northeast Corridor Rail Line in 2001, providing passengers with connections to NJ Transit and Amtrak trains for links between the airport and New York City, Philadelphia, points across New Jersey, and beyond. In October 2019, the Board provided a $2.05 billion authorization to replace the existing rail system with a completely new AirTrain. Planning for AirTrain Newark’s replacement continued throughout 2021. The project received the final go-ahead in 2021 with the Federal Aviation Administration’s issuance of a Final Environmental Assessment and a Finding of No Significant Impact/Record of Decision. A Request for Proposals (RFP) narrowed the field of potential firms for the design-build-operate-maintenance contract. A decision on the RFP and a project groundbreaking are expected in 2022 with new service set to start in 2026. The new rail link will be designed to maximize customer convenience with seamless connections to other forms of transportation and provide modern wayfinding, digital tools, and amenities in stations and in vehicles. 8

Newark Liberty International Airport Parking 

The airport offers more than 13,100 parking spaces and features a free 100-space Cell Phone Lot. In addition to two short-term surface lots in the CTA (A and B) and a remote long-term parking lot (P6), EWR has two parking garages: P4, a six-level facility at the AirTrain Station that offers ten charging stations for electric vehicles, and the C garage, which is located across from Terminal C. All lots accept E-ZPass Plus, which allows customers to use their E-ZPass to pay for parking, and customers can pre-book parking using the online Parking Reservation System. Effective June 1, 2021, all lots went to a cashless system. 

Cargo 

The airport is the overnight express package center for the NY/ NJ region, offering a full range of short-, medium-, and long-haul services to domestic and international destinations. In 2010, FedEx agreed to continue hub operations at Newark Liberty and committed to a 20-year lease extension. FedEx installed a rooftop solar electric system to provide more than 15 percent of the hub’s energy needs. Newark Liberty handled nearly 800,000 tons of air cargo in 2021. 

Runways and Taxiways 

The airport has two parallel runways, 4R-22L and 4L-22R, which support precision instrument approaches at all four ends, and a crosswind runway, 11-29, which supports precision instrument approaches only on Runway 11. Runway 4R-22L is 10,000 feet long, Runway 4L-22R is 11,000 feet long, and Runway 11-29 is 6,726 feet long. All three runways are 150 feet wide. Both of the parallel runways have displaced thresholds to reduce community noise impacts. Visual aids include high-intensity edge lights, LED centerline and touchdown zone lighting, and high-speed exit taxiway centerline lighting. More than 12 miles of 75-foot-wide taxiways link the three runways with the central terminal and cargo areas. A $97 million rehabilitation of Runway 4L-22R, including the construction of multi-entrance and cross taxiways was completed in 2014. Runway 4R-22L changed its approach lighting system to an ALSF-2, and additional high-speeds P2 and P3 were completed in 2013. Runway 4R-22L also was upgraded to a Cat III approach system allowing for landings in poor weather conditions in 2013. A $46 million rehabilitation of Runway 11-29 was completed in 2020. During the rehabilitation of Runway 11-29, incandescent runway lighting was converted to LED lighting. An $84.2 million rehab of Runway 4R-22L was completed in 2021.

Port Authority Administration Building 

Reconstruction of the airport’s original 1935 Central Terminal Building, which is now a National Historic Landmark, was completed in 2002. Now designated Building One, this 100,000-square-foot facility now serves as the Port Authority’s Administration Building, hosting airport management, operations, program management, the Port Authority Police Command, Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF), and an emergency operations center (EOC). 

Air Traffic Control Tower 

A 325-foot air traffic control tower was commissioned in 2003, the fourth in the airport’s history. The rooftop of Building One, the Port Authority Administration Building, features what is believed to be the first air traffic control tower ever built. The nation’s first air route traffic control center was established on the airport in 1935. 9

History  

> ■

At the turn of the 20th century, the airport site, then commonly known as North Beach, was occupied by the Gala Amusement Park.  

> ■

In 1929, the 105-acre site was purchased by the Curtiss-Wright Co. and developed into a private flying field. Originally called the Glenn H. Curtiss Airport, it later became known as Curtiss-Wright Field.  

> ■

The City of New York purchased Curtiss-Wright Field in 1935 and renamed it North Beach Airport. On September 9, 1937, ground was broken for a new airport, which on October 15, 1939, was dedicated as New York City Municipal Airport.

Eighteen days later, on November 2, 1939, the airport was renamed New York Municipal Airport-LaGuardia Field to honor New York City’s then-Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia.  

> ■

On December 2, 1939, the airport opened to commercial traffic. It soon became known simply as LaGuardia Airport.  

> ■

The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey began operating LaGuardia Airport in 1947. 

Size and Location 

LaGuardia Airport covers 680 acres. It borders Flushing and Bowery bays in the northwestern section of Queens County, New York City, about eight miles by highway from midtown Manhattan. 

Aviation Role 

LaGuardia Airport is one of the nation’s leading domestic gateways for business and leisure travel and is the primary business/short-haul airport for New York City. LaGuardia Airport which relative to its size has held the distinction of being the most efficient airport in the world by handling more passengers per acre per year than any other airport, served a record 31.1 million passengers in 2019. In 2021 – a year of ongoing recovery following the sharp decline in air travel worldwide due to the pandemic – LaGuardia served more than 15.5 million passengers. 

Employment and Economic Impact 

LaGuardia Airport employs about 13,700 people and plays a critical role in addressing the region’s transportation needs, as well as fueling the economy. The airport contributes more than $11.3 billion in economic activity to the New York-New Jersey metropolitan region, supporting nearly 50,000 total jobs and more than $4.3 billion in annual wages. 

Investment 

Original construction by the City of New York cost $40 million. The Port Authority’s total capital investment in the airport to date is more than $5.4 billion. 

Redevelopment 

Construction continues on the multibillion-dollar redevelopment of Terminal B and Terminal C, including related airport infrastructure. The project comprises 2.7 million square feet, 72 new gates, two new terminal arrivals and departures halls connected by a central hall, and 13.7 miles of new roadway. The redevelopment of Terminal B, which will be substantially complete in 2022, comprises nearly 1.3 million square feet and includes a new four-level, 35-gate terminal, a Central Hall, a parking garage, and related roadways and supporting infrastructure. The arrivals level features nine baggage carousels, two oversize luggage belts, and access to the parking garage, taxis, and for-hire and private vehicle pick-up. The departures level includes 75 counters located within four large check-in islands, 105 self-service kiosks, and a first-of-its-kind-in-North America TSA security checkpoint installation. The new terminal provides a world-class passenger experience and features a host of modern customer amenities, state-of-the-art architecture, and more spacious gate areas. Delta Air Lines is currently building a new Terminal C. The majority of the new Terminal C will open in spring 2022 with full completion in 2024 on a 1.1 million-square-foot terminal with 37 flexibly sized gates that can accommodate Delta’s full fleet; a centralized check-in lobby, security checkpoint and baggage claim; dual taxiways to reduce gate congestion and taxi times; a new, larger Delta Sky Club with a Sky Deck; and more efficient airport roadways. Designed for speed and efficiency, the new terminal will allow customers to check-in and drop bags at every entrance into the terminal before proceeding directly to the security checkpoint. Dedicated check-in facilities will be available for premium customers while the new Sky Club and outdoor deck feature expansive views of the airfield. Within its elegant interior, passengers will have access to larger gate hold rooms with more seating, in-seat power at all seats, as well as increased circulation space for boarding the aircraft and transferring between gates.

LaGuardia Airport 

A new electrical substation provides a more reliable and robust source of power for the airport. Hangars 2 and 4 located just east of Terminal B were demolished in anticipation of redevelopment construction. Additionally, parking lot P2 in front of Terminal B was demolished to make way for the new Terminal B head house, which opened in June 2020. In 2010, the Port Authority completed the airport’s Police Crisis Command Center and Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) Facility, and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) began operating from a new tower. In December 2018, a new Central Heating & Refrigeration Plant (CHRP) located on the east side of the new Terminal B Headhouse opened. 

Passenger Terminals  

> ■

Originally known as the Overseas Terminal, then the Marine Air Terminal (MAT), Terminal A is the original airport terminal building. It served international flights on flying boats through the 1940s. General aviation also operates from the terminal through a fixed-base operator. In 1995, the MAT was designated an historic landmark. A $7 million restoration of the terminal was completed in 2004. On December 9, 2017, JetBlue Airways moved into Terminal A.  

> ■

The original Terminal B, once known as the Central Terminal Building or CTB, was dedicated on April 17, 1964. Terminal B serves Air Canada, American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines. The 1964 version of Terminal B was 1,300 feet long and 180 feet wide, with approximately 835,000 square feet of floor space. Originally constructed at a cost of $36 million and then expanded and modernized for $340 million in the 1990s, the terminal consisted of a four-story central section with two three-story wings.  

> ■

Opened in September 1992 and costing $200 million, Terminal C comprises approximately 300,000 square feet of space with 21 aircraft contact gates. Operated by Delta Air Lines, the terminal features an innovative mix of food, retail, and concessions integrated into the gate holdroom areas and a Welcome Center on the arrivals level. Spirit Airlines (Departures) and Frontier Airways (Departures) are now based in the terminal. In 2017, Delta Air Lines started construction of a new Terminal C that will replace the current Terminals C & D.  

> ■

Terminal D, which consists of 10 gates, opened at the east end of the airport in June 1983. It is operated by Delta Air Lines and hosts Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines (Arrivals), Spirit Airlines (Arrivals) and WestJet. In 2010, Delta enhanced and expanded the terminal’s food, retail, and concessions options, and the Port Authority opened a Welcome Center on the arrivals level. Delta expanded its operations into Terminal C following its takeover of the US Airways lease of Terminal C in 2011 and invested nearly $100 million in its terminal complex to improve customer access, speed baggage handling, and improve the concessions and customer service experience. In 2012, Delta opened a 600-foot-long enclosed walkway connecting Terminals C and D. 

AirTrain Laguardia 

In October 2019, the Port Authority Board of Commissioners provided a $2.05 billion authorization to develop AirTrain LGA. The project was paused in October 2021 as the Port Authority’s evaluation of mass transit options for reducing car traffic and increasing connectivity to LaGuardia Airport expanded to include input from a panel of three international, national and regional transportation experts as well as consultation with the MTA. In early 2022, The Port Authority contacted key stakeholders for input on the evaluation of 14 potential mass transit options to the airport, including input on any other options that should be considered. A questionnaire describing the options and the factors being considered in evaluating the options was sent to more than 70 key stakeholders, including elected officials and community organizations. Options being evaluated include two potential subway extensions, five potential routes for fixed guideways for light rail connections, five potential bus routes, ferry service, and other emerging technologies. 

Parking 

LaGuardia Airport offers about 3,900 public parking spaces with, E-Z Pass Plus and Express Pay machines in all parking garages. In 2018, a new 3,100-space Terminal B Parking Garage opened for use. The seven-level garage connects directly with Terminal B. The garage also is used to stage and pick up passengers using for-hire vehicles from Terminal B. When the garage opened, the airport also launched a first-of-its-kind parking pre-booking website that allows customers to reserve a guaranteed, discounted garage parking space.

Runways 

There are two main runways, 4-22 and 13-31. Each is 7,000 feet long by 150 feet wide. In a $40 million project completed in 1967 by the Port Authority, both runways were extended over the bays around the airport to their present lengths. The runway extensions are supported upon a 50-acre, L-shaped, pile-supported concrete deck structure. All runways have high-intensity runway edge lighting, centerline, and taxiway exit lighting and are grooved for added traction during wet weather. Touchdown zone lighting was added on Runway 13 in 2005 and on Runways 4 and 22 in 2009 as part of the runway rehabilitation programs. As part of an FAA Runway Safety Area project, two new Engineered Materials Arresting Systems (EMAS) beds were installed on Runways 4 and 31 in 2015. 

Air Traffic Control Tower 

The Federal Aviation Administration commissioned a new 233-foot-tall, state-of-the-art air traffic control tower in October 2010. The new tower features the latest aviation technology, including a system that tracks the surface movement of aircraft and vehicles, enhancing safety and efficiency. The $100 million tower replaced an iconic tower that had served the airport since 1964. 

LaGuardia Airport is being transformed into a world-class facility that already has been ranked among the best in the nation.

History  

> ■

In 1930, Archie Stewart, an aviation buff and descendant of prominent local dairy farmer Lachlan Stewart, along with his uncle, Samuel Lachlan Stewart, donated 220 acres of land to the City of Newburgh to be used as an airport.  

> ■

In 1934, Douglas MacArthur proposed flight training for cadets, and the City of Newburgh transferred the land to the U.S. government for $1. Construction begins and a small dirt airstrip was cleared and graded.  

> ■

In 1939, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point built the first airfield at Stewart for cadet aviation training. The north entrance to the USMA was named after the old Stewart farm, “Stoney Lonesome.”  

> ■

In 1948, the airfield became Stewart Air Force Base.  

> ■

In 1970, Stewart Airport was acquired by the State of New York. Operating responsibility was later transferred to the New York State Department of Transportation (DOT).  

> ■

In the 1980s, several business enterprises began operations at Stewart after the DOT and Urban Development Corporation began planning for the development of the airport.  

> ■

In 1980, Runway 9-27 is expanded to nearly 12,000 feet in length, allowing it to accommodate any large aircraft in the world.  

> ■

In 1981, U.S. hostages held in Iran returned to the United States via Stewart Airport.  

> ■

In 1990, scheduled air carrier service began as American Airlines offered the first commercial flights.  

> ■

On March 31, 2000, Stewart Airport became the nation’s first privatized commercial airport under a 99-year lease agreement with National Express.  

> ■

On November 1, 2007, the Port Authority purchased the remaining 93 years of the operating lease for $78.5 million.  

> ■

On June 15, 2017, the airport welcomed its first-ever scheduled nonstop transatlantic arrival: a Norwegian Air flight from Edinburgh, Scotland.  

> ■

On February 21, 2018, the Port Authority announced the airport was being renamed New York Stewart International Airport as part of an upgrade and modernization program. The new name will make it significantly easier for travelers to identify the airport’s geographical location. 

Size and Location 

Stewart Airport covers 2,400 acres. It is located at the Intersection of the New York State Thruway (Interstate 87) and Interstate 84, in Newburgh/New Windsor in Orange County, New York, less than 60 miles north of Manhattan. 

Aviation Role 

Stewart Airport is an economical, convenient alternative to the New York/New Jersey metropolitan region’s airports. Several commercial and charter airlines operate at the airport, offering direct access to several major U.S. hubs with connections to virtually anywhere in the world. In 2019, Stewart served about 530,000 passengers and handled more than 22,000 tons of cargo. In 2021 – a year of ongoing recovery following the sharp decline in air travel worldwide due to the pandemic – Stewart served more than 135,000 passengers and handled about 31,000 tons of cargo. 

Employment and Economic Impact 

Airport activity contributed $125 million in economic activity to its region and supported more than 600 jobs and $46 million in annual wages. More than half the capital projects initiated by the Port Authority have been awarded to local firms and contractors. 

Investment 

A $100 million project that rehabilitated and modernized both runways was completed in mid-2015, representing the largest investment ever made in a single project in Stewart Airport’s history. Since the Port Authority took over the airport in November 2007, it has invested more than $218 million to make improvements. 

Redevelopment 

In 1991, Stewart International became the first facility to receive $5 million in funding under the Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) Military Airport Program for capital improvements to airports that were formerly military facilities or military/civil aircraft-use facilities. That same year, the FAA awarded Stewart a $900,000 grant to fund a master plan update, conduct an environmental review, and prepare a noise study. The airport also received $13 million in federal funding for infrastructure rehabilitation. In 1992, the FAA awarded another $3 million for terminal expansion and redesign. A 50,000-square-foot air cargo building opened in 1990. In 2007, the Port Authority initiated its redevelopment program, whose upgrades include the complete repaving of both of the airport’s runways as part of a $100 million project — the largest in the airport’s history — and a new Federal Inspection Services facility to accommodate international flights. In December 2011, the Port Authority Board of Commissioners approved an expansion of the airport’s passenger terminal. The Port Authority built a new $10 million regional crime lab for the New York State Police as part of an agreement that ensures the police force continues to guard and protect the airport. The lab opened in 2015. A $37 million project that expanded the terminal and created a permanent Federal Inspection Service facility for U.S. Customs and Border Protection was completed in 2020.

Community Relations and Noise Abatement 

Since 1987, Teterboro Airport has engaged local communities in dialogue on issues of mutual interest through the Teterboro Airport Noise Abatement Advisory Committee (TANAAC). The airport provides airport data and other information to the Committee as well as facilitates access for TANAAC to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and provides technical advice in support of the Committee’s efforts the to enhance quality of life for surrounding communities while maintaining the efficiency of airport operations. Teterboro Airport also has a robust noise abatement program that has been in place since the 1970s. The program is grandfathered from changes in FAA regulations as it predates the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 (ANCA). The noise abatement program establishes noise limits for operations on its runways that are monitored and tracked. Aircraft that violate the noise limits three times in a two-year period can be banned from the airport. The airport also has a very successful voluntary curfew on nighttime operations from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. 

Teterboro Airport 

Teterboro Airport is the nation’s premier general aviation reliever facility and plays a critical role in the region by accommodating non-scheduled, general aviation aircraft that otherwise would cause major congestion at the Port Authority’s commercial airports.

Note: Beginning with the 2018 economic impact, the methodology used in calculating the economic impacts was revised to better conform to changes in the aviation industry. This change also includes using the latest IMPLAN Input/Output model. The previous methodology used the Bureau of Economic Analysis Regional Input-Output models (BEA RIMs). As a result, previously estimated economic impacts are not directly comparable. 69 69
