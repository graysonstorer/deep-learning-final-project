Domestic Movie Theatrical Market Summary 1995 to 2025
-----------------------------------------------------

Welcome to our reference library analyzing trends in the domestic movie industry since 1995. In this area of the site, you'll find over 2,000 pages of information detailing the changes that have shaped the industry.

Our market analysis is built on The Numbers' unique categorization system, which uses six different criteria to identify a movie. Every movie released since 1995 is categorized according to the following attributes: Creative Type (factual, contemporary fiction, fantasy etc.), Source (book, play, original screenplay...), Genre (drama, horror, documentary etc.), MPAA Rating, Production Method (live action, digital animation etc.) and Distributor. Our market charts provide year-by-year analysis across these categories, allowing analysis of market trends. See, for example, how [horror movie revenues have varied](https://www.the-numbers.com/market/genre/Horror), the [emergence of digital animation](https://www.the-numbers.com/market/production-method/Digital-Animation) and [live action/CGI animated](https://www.the-numbers.com/market/production-method/Animation-and-Live-Action) movies, and [the decline (and possible rebound) of R-rated movies](https://www.the-numbers.com/market/mpaa-rating/R-(US)). To explore, click on an individual year, distributor, genre, creative type, production method or MPAA rating to see annual trends in a particular category.

**Note:** in order to provide a fair comparison between movies released in different years, all rankings are based on ticket sales, which are calculated using average ticket prices. Before 2020, these were announced by the MPAA and/or NATO in their annual state of the industry report. Since 2020, we have been [estimating the average ticket price](https://www.the-numbers.com/news/258910830-Movie-theater-ticket-prices-rose-3-to-11-31-in-2024) based on SEC filings from the major theater owners.

Our Theatrical Market pages are based on the Domestic Theatrical Market performance only. The Domestic Market is defined as the North American movie territory (consisting of the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and Guam).

The yearly amounts on our Theatrical Market pages are based on box office years. Each box office year starts on the first Monday of the year, so the previous year ends on the Sunday before the first Monday. For example, the "2017 box office year" started on January 2, 2017 so the "2016 box office year" ended on Sunday, January 1, 2017.
