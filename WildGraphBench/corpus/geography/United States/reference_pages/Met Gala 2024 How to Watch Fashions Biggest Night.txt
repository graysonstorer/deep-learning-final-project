---------------------------------------------

It was also be broadcast live across all of _Vogue_’s YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter pages.

**What time did the livestream start?**
---------------------------------------

The 2024 Met Gala livestream began at 6 p.m. Eastern.

**Who hosted the livestream?**
------------------------------

The 2024 Met Gala livestream once again was hosted by actor and producer[La La Anthony](https://www.glamour.com/story/lala-vasquez-to-launch-makeup), who was joined by _Game of Thrones_ actor [Gwendoline Christie](https://www.glamour.com/story/gwendoline-christie-emmys-2019-red-carpet-reactions) and model [Ashley Graham](https://www.glamour.com/story/ashley-graham-motherhood-miscarriage-childbirth-body-positivity). Internet multihyphenate[Emma Chamberlain](https://www.glamour.com/story/emma-chamberlain-met-gala-2022-photos) returned as _Vogue_’s special correspondent.

**What was the 2024 Met Gala theme?**
-------------------------------------

The 2024 Met Gala celebrated the Costume Institute’s new exhibition, “Sleeping Beauties: Reawakening Fashion" and the official dress code was The Garden of Time. As always, attendees interpreted the theme differently, with some looks that were literal and others that are purely conceptual. The event’s curators told _Vogue_ that the exhibition will be shaped around three main zones—Land, Sea, and Sky—that pay tribute to the natural world.

![Image 8: Lana Del Ray and Kim Kardashian at the 2024 Met Gala](https://media.glamour.com/photos/663a6e2dc2b2fefe10e7302a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-2151796393.jpg)

The exhibit will feature approximately 250 rare items from the Costume Institute’s permanent collection that span more than 400 years of fashion history, including designs by some of the world’s most revered fashion visionaries and houses, including Dior, Schiaparelli, Givenchy, and more. According to _Vogue_, some of the garments are too fragile to wear—including a Charles Frederick Worth ball gown from 1877—and will be displayed via video animation, light projection, AI, CGI, and other forms of sensory stimulation.

**Who were the 2024 Met Gala co-chairs?**
-----------------------------------------

In addition to _Vogue_ global editorial director Anna Wintour, who is also chief content officer of Condé Nast, this year’s celebrity cochairs are multihyphenate [Jennifer Lopez](https://www.glamour.com/about/jennifer-lopez),actor [Zendaya](https://www.glamour.com/about/zendaya), musician [Bad Bunny,](https://www.glamour.com/story/kendall-jenner-bad-bunny-relationship-timeline) and actor [Chris Hemsworth](https://www.glamour.com/about/chris-hemsworth).

**Who attended the 2024 Met Gala?**
-----------------------------------

Hundreds of famous people, notably [Kim Kardashian](https://www.glamour.com/story/kim-kardashians-met-gala-2024-look-was-designed-for-drama-and-its-getting-old), [Sydney Sweeney,](https://www.glamour.com/story/sydney-sweeney-met-gala-2024) Lana Del Ray, Kendall and [Kylie Jenner](https://www.glamour.com/story/kylie-jenner-met-gala-2024), Tyla, Doja Cat, [Pamela Anderson](https://www.glamour.com/story/pamela-anderson-is-absolutely-glowing-at-the-met-gala-2024-in-oscar-de-la-renta), Ayo Edebiri, Mindy Kaling, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jessica Biel, and Cardi B. Many fans speculated as to whether singer-songwriter Taylor Swift would make her Met Gala return after an eight-year absence, but sadly [this was not the case.](https://www.glamour.com/story/will-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-make-their-met-gala-debut) Also notably missing: Met staples [Blake Lively](https://www.glamour.com/story/why-didnt-blake-lively-attend-the-met-gala-2024), Rihanna ([who reportedly had the flu](https://www.glamour.com/story/rihanna-met-gala-2024)), and Beyonce.

**What even _is_ the Met Gala?**
--------------------------------

Organized and presided over by Wintour since 1995, the Met Gala has become a truly iconic yearly celebration of high fashion (it’s known colloquially as the Oscars of Fashion.) A fundraiser for The Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, it’s usually timed to mark the opening of its annual fashion exhibition in May of every year. The one exception was in 2021, when the gala was held in September due to COVID-19 restrictions. The event raises eight-figure sums and invites around 600 of world’s most famous actors, models, designers, captains of industry, editors, and generally some of the world’s most highly influential and powerful people.

Of course, the big question this year is [whether Taylor Swift will attend the 2024 Met Gala](https://www.glamour.com/story/will-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-attend-2024-met-gala-everything-we-know) with boyfriend Travis Kelce after being absent from the iconic event for right years.
