Google

This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project

to make the world's books discoverable online.

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain.A public domain book is one that was never subject

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired.Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country.Public domain books

are our gateways to the past,representing a wealth of history,culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover.

Marks,notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file-a reminder of this book's long journey from the

publisher to a library and finally to you.

Usage guidelines

Google is proud to partner with libraries to digitize public domain materials and make them widely accessible.Public domain books belong to the public and we are merely their custodians.Nevertheless,this work is expensive,so in order to keep providing tliis resource,we liave taken steps to prevent abuse by commercial parties,including placing technical restrictions on automated querying.We also ask that you:

+Make non-commercial use of the files We designed Google Book Search for use by individuals,and we request that you use these files for personal,non-commercial purposes.

+Refrain fivm automated querying Do not send automated queries of any sort to Google's system:If you are conducting research on machine translation,optical character recognition or other areas where access to a large amount of text is helpful,please contact us.We encourage the use of public domain materials for these purposes and may be able to help.

+Maintain attributionTht GoogXt"watermark"you see on each file is essential for in forming people about this project and helping them find additional materials through Google Book Search.Please do not remove it.

+Keep it legal Whatever your use,remember that you are responsible for ensuring that what you are doing is legal.Do not assume that just because we believe a book is in the public domain for users in the United States,that the work is also in the public domain for users in other countries.Whether a book is still in copyright varies from country to country,and we can't offer guidance on whether any specific use of any specific book is allowed.Please do not assume that a book's appearance in Google Book Search means it can be used in any manner anywhere in the world.Copyright infringement liabili^can be quite severe.
