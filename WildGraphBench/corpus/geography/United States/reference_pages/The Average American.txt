Can you chip in? As an independent nonprofit, the Internet Archive is fighting for universal access to quality information. We build and maintain all our own systems, but we don’t charge for access, sell user information, or run ads. We'd be deeply grateful if you'd join the one in a thousand users that support us financially. 

We understand that not everyone can donate right now, but if you can afford to contribute this Tuesday, we promise it will be put to good use. Our resources are crucial for knowledge lovers everywhere—so if you find all these bits and bytes useful, **please pitch in.**

**Please Don't Scroll Past This**The Internet Archive is working to keep the record straight by recording government websites, news publications, historical documents, and more. If you find our library useful, **please pitch in.**
