​​​​​​The NBA is a 77-year-old organization born from innovation. It was June 1946 in New York City when Boston Garden owner Walter Brown realized that major ice hockey arenas, which were vacant most nights, could be used to host basketball games. He established the Basketball Association of America, which in 1949 merged with the National Basketball League to create the National Basketball Association.

The NBA has a rich tradition of game-changing plays and storied rivalries, personal sagas and team dynasties. Players and fans alike share the excitement of reliving key moments in basketball history, and admiring the excellence of former players, coaches and teams who helped shape the game. The league is home to living legends, and we honor their achievements while also looking to the future.

Today, the NBA is the most innovative league in sports, helping drive the growth of the game around the globe. We're pioneers in using technology to deliver content to fans over all forms of media, and a leader in social responsibility and community development.

We're preparing the league’s rising stars and staff in the NBA G League, our official minor league. Further, we're growing and expanding our Jr. NBA programs to get kids playing basketball and to nurture a love of the game and its values. Through our NBA Cares program, we're building places where families can live, learn and play.
