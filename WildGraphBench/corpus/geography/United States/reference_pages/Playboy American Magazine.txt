**Playboy**, American [magazine](https://www.britannica.com/topic/magazine-publishing) aimed at men, the first to present female nudity and sexually oriented material in a relatively [sophisticated](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/sophisticated) format. For the magazine’s first issue in 1953, its founder, [Hugh Hefner](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Hugh-Hefner), used a previously unpublished nude calendar photograph of [Marilyn Monroe](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Marilyn-Monroe), who also appeared (in clothing) on the cover. The logo of _Playboy_’s parent company, Playboy Enterprises, Inc., depicting the head of a [rabbit](https://www.britannica.com/animal/rabbit) in a tuxedo bow tie, eventually became one of the most-recognized trademarks in the world.

Although most famous for its photo spreads, _Playboy_ also published general articles and fiction, both of which were frequently of high quality. Its interviews with celebrities and other newsworthy persons won wide attention. The periodical emphasized what it considered progressive sexual views. The “Playboy Philosophy,” [articulated](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/articulated) by Hefner himself in the pages of the magazine, advocated complete personal freedom (for both men and women) in all things, including sex. Through its support of that belief and its popularization of the notion that viewing sexually suggestive photography of women was not only acceptable but healthy, it contributed to the so-called [sexual revolution](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sexual-revolution) in the [United States](https://www.britannica.com/place/United-States) in the 1960s, marked by greatly more permissive attitudes toward sexual interest and activity than had been prevalent in earlier generations. The magazine’s format and approach were widely imitated.

From the 1950s to the early ’70s _Playboy_’s [circulation](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/circulation) (including subscription and newsstand sales) and advertising revenues steadily increased, reaching a high point of 7.2 million copies sold in November 1972 and average sales of 5.6 million copies per issue in 1975. In the 1980s, however, the magazine’s readership declined steeply, partly because the sexual revolution it continued to advocate had largely been won, rendering its image less daring and less provocative and partly because it faced new competition from racier publications such as _Penthouse_, which featured cruder and more-explicit nude photography. Under the leadership of Hefner’s daughter, Christie Hefner, who was appointed president of the parent company in 1982 and served as [chief executive officer](https://www.britannica.com/money/chief-executive-officer) from 1988 to 2009 (her father remained editor-in-chief), the magazine was recast as an advocate of [First Amendment](https://www.britannica.com/topic/First-Amendment) freedoms and a defender of progressive positions on a variety of social issues. By the end of the decade, _Playboy_’s circulation had stabilized at about 3.4 million. The company established a [Web site](https://www.britannica.com/technology/website), Playboy.com, in 1994, which was an immediate success. In the 2000s, however, circulation of the print magazine dropped again, falling to less than one million by 2015. Also that year, [citing](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/citing) the wide availability of [pornography](https://www.britannica.com/topic/pornography) on the [Internet](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Internet), the company announced that _Playboy_ would no longer feature photos of nude women, but it reversed that decision in 2017.

**magazine**, a printed or digitally published collection of texts (essays, articles, stories, poems), often illustrated, that is produced at regular intervals (excluding newspapers). A brief [treatment](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/treatment) of magazines follows. For full treatment, _see_[publishing: Magazine publishing](https://www.britannica.com/topic/publishing/Magazine-publishing#ref28679).

The modern magazine has its roots in early printed [pamphlets](https://www.britannica.com/art/pamphlet), broadsides, [chapbooks](https://www.britannica.com/art/chapbook), and [almanacs](https://www.britannica.com/topic/almanac), a few of which gradually began appearing at regular intervals. The earliest magazines collected a variety of material designed to appeal to particular interests. One of the earliest ones was a German publication, _[Erbauliche Monaths-Unterredungen](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Erbauliche-Monaths-Unterredungen)_ (“Edifying Monthly Discussions”), which was issued periodically from 1663 to 1668. Other learned journals soon appeared in France, England, and Italy, and in the early 1670s lighter and more entertaining magazines began to appear, beginning with _Le Mercure Galant_ (1672; later renamed _[Mercure de France](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Le-Mercure-de-France)_) in France. In the early 18th century, [Joseph Addison](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Joseph-Addison) and [Richard Steele](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Richard-Steele) brought out _[The Tatler](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Tatler)_ (1709–11; published three times weekly) and _[The Spectator](https://www.britannica.com/topic/The-Spectator-British-periodical-1711-1712)_ (1711–12, 1714; published daily). These influential periodicals contained essays on matters political and topical that continue to be regarded as examples of some of the finest English prose written. Other critical reviews treating literary and political issues also started up in the mid-1700s throughout western Europe, and at the end of the century specialized periodicals began appearing, devoted to particular fields of [intellectual](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intellectual) interest, such as archaeology, botany, or philosophy.

By the early 19th century a different, less learned audience had been identified, and new types of magazines for entertainment and family enjoyment began to appear, among them the popular weekly, the women’s weekly, the religious and missionary review, the illustrated magazine, and the children’s weekly. Their growth was stimulated by the general public’s broader interest in social and political affairs and by the middle and lower classes’ growing demand, in both cities and rural areas, for reading matter. Woodcuts and engravings were first extensively used by the weekly _[Illustrated London News](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Illustrated-London-News)_ (1842), and by the end of the 19th century many magazines were illustrated.

Magazine publishing benefited in the late 19th and 20th centuries from a number of technical improvements, including the production of inexpensive paper, the invention of the [rotary press](https://www.britannica.com/technology/rotary-press) and the halftone block, and, especially, the addition of advertisements as a means of financial support. Other developments since then have included a greater specialization of topics; more illustrations, especially those reproducing colour photographs; a decline in power and popularity of the critical review and a rise in that of the mass-market magazine; and an increase in magazines for women.

With the rise of the [Internet](https://www.britannica.com/technology/Internet) in the late 20th century, more and more magazines put versions of their material online. During this time, other types of magazines became increasingly popular. These included electronic magazines, known as e-zines or [zines](https://www.britannica.com/topic/zine). Often of casual design and produced by at most a few people, e-zines tended to be highly personal and [irreverent](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/irreverent). Another kind of magazine was the fanzine, which was generally produced for fans of a sport or a particular celebrity, among other subjects.

Technological advancements, however, also had a downside for the magazine industry. As people had easier—and often free—access to a wealth of content, traditional magazines faced declining readership. In addition, ad revenue dropped as advertisers increasingly turned to other online outlets. Such factors contributed to a number of magazines folding in the early 21st century, while others were forced to discontinue print editions and publish only digital versions.
