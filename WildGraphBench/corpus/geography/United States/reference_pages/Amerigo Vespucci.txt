**Amerigo Vespucci****,**(born 1454?,Florence, Italy—died 1512,Sevilla, Spain),merchant and explorer-navigator who took part in early voyages to the New World (1499–1500, 1501–02) and occupied the influential post of _piloto mayor_ (“master navigator”) in Sevilla (1508–12). The name for the [Americas](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/20369/Americas) is derived from his [given name](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/234457/given-name).

Early life
Table Of Contents
----------------------------

Vespucci was the son of Nastagio, a notary. As a boy Vespucci was given a [humanistic education](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/276009/humanistic-education) by his uncle Giorgio Antonio. In 1479 he accompanied another relation, sent by the famous [Italian](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297751/history-of-Italy)[Medici family](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/372380/Medici-Family) to be their spokesman to the king of France. On returning, Vespucci entered the “bank” of Lorenzo and Giovanni di Pierfrancesco de’ Medici and gained the confidence of his employers. At the end of 1491 their agent, Giannotto Berardi, appears to have been engaged partly in fitting out ships; and Vespucci was probably present when [Christopher Columbus](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/127070/Christopher-Columbus) returned from his first expedition, which Berardi had assisted. Later Vespucci was to collaborate, still with Berardi, in the preparation of a ship for Columbus’s second expedition and of others for his third. When Berardi died, either at the end of 1495 or at the beginning of 1496, Vespucci became manager of the Sevilla agency.

Vespucci’s voyages
Table Of Contents
------------------------------------

The period during which Vespucci made his voyages falls between 1497 and 1504. Two series of documents on his voyages are extant. The first series consists of a letter in the name of Vespucci from Lisbon, Portugal, dated September 4, 1504, written in Italian, perhaps to the _gonfalonier_ (magistrate of a medieval Italian republic) Piero Soderini, and printed in Florence in 1505; and of two Latin versions of this letter, printed under the titles of “[Quattuor Americi navigationes](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/486615/Quattuor-Americi-navigationes)” and “Mundus Novus,” or “Epistola Alberici de Novo Mundo.” The second series consists of three private letters addressed to the Medici. In the first series of documents, four voyages by Vespucci are mentioned; in the second, only two. Until the 1930s the documents of the first series were considered from the point of view of the order of the four voyages. According to a theory of Alberto Magnaghi, on the contrary, these documents are to be regarded as the result of skillful manipulations, and the sole authentic papers would be the private letters, so that the verified voyages would be reduced to two. The question is fundamental for the evaluation of Vespucci’s work and has given rise to fierce controversy; attempts to reconcile the two series of documents cannot generally be considered successful.

The voyage completed by Vespucci between May 1499 and June 1500 as navigator of an expedition of four ships sent from Spain under the command of [Alonso de Ojeda](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/426321/Alonso-de-Ojeda) is certainly authentic. (This is the second expedition of the traditional series.) Since Vespucci took part as navigator, he certainly cannot have been inexperienced; but it does not seem possible that he had made a previous voyage (1497–98) in this area (i.e., around the [Gulf of Mexico](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/379348/Gulf-of-Mexico) and the Atlantic coast from Florida to [Chesapeake Bay](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/109624/Chesapeake-Bay)), though this matter remains unresolved.

In the voyage of 1499–1500 Vespucci would seem to have left Ojeda after reaching the coast of what is now Guyana. Turning south, he is believed to have discovered the mouth of the [Amazon River](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/18722/Amazon-River) and to have gone as far as Cape St. Augustine (latitude about 6° S). On the way back he reached Trinidad, sighted the mouth of the [Orinoco River](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/432619/Orinoco-River), and then made for Haiti. Vespucci thought he had sailed along the coast of the extreme easterly peninsula of Asia, where Ptolemy, the geographer, believed the market of Cattigara to be; so he looked for the tip of this peninsula, calling it Cape Cattigara. He supposed that the ships, once past this point, emerged into the seas of southern Asia. As soon as he was back in Spain, he equipped a fresh expedition with the aim of reaching the [Indian Ocean](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/285876/Indian-Ocean), the Gulf of the Ganges (modern [Bay of Bengal](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/60740/Bay-of-Bengal)), and the island of Taprobane or Ceylon (now [Sri Lanka](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/561906/Sri-Lanka)). But the Spanish government did not welcome his proposals, and at the end of 1500 Vespucci went into the service of [Portugal](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/471543/history-of-Portugal).

Under Portuguese auspices Vespucci completed a second expedition, which set off from Lisbon on May 13, 1501. After a halt at the Cape Verde Islands, the expedition traveled southwestward and reached the coast of [Brazil](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/78269/history-of-Brazil) toward Cape St. Augustine. The remainder of the voyage is disputed, but Vespucci claimed to have continued southward, and he may have sighted (January 1502) [Guanabara Bay](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/247734/Guanabara-Bay) (Rio de Janeiro’s bay) and sailed as far as the [Río de la Plata](http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/504222/Viceroyalty-of-the-Rio-de-la-Plata), making Vespucci the first European to discover that estuary (Juan Díaz de Solís arrived there in 1516). The ships may have journeyed still farther south, along the coast of Patagonia (in present-day southern Argentina). The return route is unknown. Vespucci’s ships anchored at Lisbon on July 22, 1502.
