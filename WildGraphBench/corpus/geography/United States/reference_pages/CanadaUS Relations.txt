# SUMMARY 

# Canada -U.S. Relations 

The United States and Canada typically enjoy close relations . The two countries are bound 

together by a common 5,525 -mile border —“the longest undefended border in the world” —as 

well as by shared history and values. They have extensive trade and investment tie s and long -

standing mutual security commitments under NATO and North American Aerospace Defense 

Command (NORAD ). Canada and the United States also cooperate closely on intelligence and 

law enforcement matters , placing a particular focus on border security and cybersecurity 

initiatives in recent years. 

Although Canada’s foreign and defense policies usually are aligned with those of the United 

States, disagreements arise from time to time. Canada’s Liberal Party government, led by Prime 

Minister Justin Trudea u, has prioritized multilateral efforts to renew and strengthen the rules -

based international order since coming to power in November 2015. It expressed disappointment 

with former President Donald Trump’s decisions to withdraw from international organizations 

and accords , and it questioned whether the United States was abandoning its global leadership role. Cooperation on 

international issues may improve under President Joe Biden, who spoke with Prime Minister Trudeau in his first call to a 

foreig n leader and expressed interest in working with Canada to address climate change and other global challenges. 

The United States and Canada have a deep economic partnership , with approximately $1.4 billion of goods crossing the 

border each day in 2020 . Bila teral trade relations have been somewhat strained in recent years , however, due to the countries’ 

differing trade policy objectives. Canadian officials expressed particular frustration with t he Trump Administration’s 

insistence on renegotiating the 1994 No rth America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which resulted in the United States -

Mexico -Canada Agreement (USMCA), and its imposition of tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. The Biden 

Administration may take a less confrontational approach to trade relation s with Canada . Nevertheless, some long -standing 

issues , such as cross -border oil pipelines, softwood lumber, and Buy American policies , likely will remain contentious. 

Because Canada and the United States are similar in many ways, lawmakers in both countri es often study policies and 

solutions proposed across the border. U.S. and Canadian domestic policies diverged on various matters over the past four 

years , as the Trudeau government implemented a carbon pricing system to address climate change, legalized the re creational 

cannabis market , increased refugee resettlement, and expanded Canada’s social safety ne t. The U.S. and Canadian 

governments also diverged in their responses to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID -19) pandemic with respect to the role 

of the federal government and fiscal policies to mitigate the economic impact on individuals and businesses. 

Th e 116 th Congress enacted several m easures related to U.S. -Canada relations. Perhaps most significantly, the United States -

Mexico -Canada Agreement Implementation Act ( P.L. 116 -113 ) was signed into law in January 2020, paving the way for the 

agreement’s entry into force. Congress also continued to support Great Lakes restoration efforts, appropriating $320 million 

for such purposes in FY2020 ( P.L. 116 -94 ) and $330 million in FY2021 ( P.L. 116 -260 ). In 2019, both houses adopted 

resolutions ( S.Res. 96 and H.Res. 521 ) commending Canada for upholding the rule of law and its international legal 

commitments following the ar rest of Meng Wanzhou, an executive at the Chinese technology company Huawei, to comply 

with an extradition request from the United States . U.S. -Canada cooperation on trade, environmental protection, foreign 

affairs, and various other issues may remain of i nterest to the 117 th Congress.

# Introduction 

History, proximity, commerce, and shared values underpin the relationship between the United 

States and Canada. Americans and Canadians fought side by side in both World Wars, Korea, and 

Afghanistan, and the United States and Canada continue to collaborate on various international 

political and security matters . The countries also share mutual security commitments under 

NA TO ; coo perate on continental defense through the binational North American Aerospace 

Defense Command (NORAD) ; maintain a close intelligence partnership as members of the “Five 

Eyes ” group of nations ; and coordinate frequently on law enforcement efforts, with a pa rticular 

focus on securing their shared 5,525 -mile border. 1

Bilateral economic ties, which were already considerable, have deepened markedly over the past 

three decades . Trade and investment relations during this period were governed first by the 1989 

U.S. -Canada Free Trade Agreement and subsequently by the 1994 North American Free Trade 

Agreement (NAFTA) ; the new United States -Mexico -Canada Agreement (USMCA) has guided 

the economic partnership since its entry into force on J uly 1, 2020 .2 Canada is the thir d-largest 

goods trading partner of the United States , with total two -way cross -border goods trade 

amount ing to more than $ 525 billion in 20 20 .3 The United States is also the largest investor in 

Canada, and Canada is an impor tant source of foreign direct investment in the United States. The 

countries have a highly integrated energy market, and Canada is the largest supplier of U.S. 

energy imports. 

Unlike many countries whose bilateral relations are conducted solely through fo reign ministries, 

the governments of the United States and Canada have deep relationships, often extending far 

down the bureaucracy, to address matters of common interest. For more than 60 years, the U.S. 

Congress has engaged directly with the Canadian Par liament through the Canada -United States 

Inter -Parliamentary Group (see textbox below). Initiatives between the states and provinces also 

are common, such as California and Quebec ’s linked greenhouse -gas (GHG) emissions trading 

market under the Western Cli mate Initiative and various other initiatives to manage 

transboundary environmental and water issues. 

Canada -United States Inter -Parliamentary Group             

> Since 1959, the U.S. Congress and the Canadian Parliament have maintained an Inter -Parliamentary Group (IPG)
> to foster mutual understanding and discuss bilateral and multilateral matters of concern to both countries .The
> IPG includes bipartisan representatives of the U.S. House and Senate and multiparty representatives of the
> Canadian House of Commons and Senate. Members historically have met annually, with the location alternating

Nevertheless, with a population and economy one -tenth the size of the United States, Canada has 

sought to protect its autonomy and chart its own course in the world while maintaining its 

historical and political ties to the British Commonwealth. Some in Canada question whether U.S. 

investme nt, regulatory cooperation, border harmonization, or other public policy issues cede too

much sovereignty to the United States, whereas others embrace a more North American approach 

to Canada ’s neighborly relationship. 

Policy differences, such as Canada ’s decision not to participate in the Iraq war in 2003 and the 

Obama Administration ’s rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline in 2015, have strained bilateral 

relations from time to time . The Canadian government welcomed President Trump ’s revival of 

Keystone XL , but several other areas of conten tion emerged during his Administration . Canadian 

offic ials expressed particular frustration with the Trump Administration ’s trade policies, including 

its approach to USMCA negotiations and its decision to impose tariffs o n Canadian steel and 

aluminum on national security grounds . Canadian officials also expressed concerns about the 

Trump Administration ’s withdraw al from the Paris Agreement on climate change and its broader 

questioning of the multilateral institutions and r ules that have helped to govern international 

relations since the end of World War II . The Trump Administration ’s policies appear to have 

contributed to a significant shift in Canadian public opinion, as the percentage of Canadians 

holding favorable views of the United States declined by 30 percentage points between 2016 and 

2020 .4

President Joe Biden spoke with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau during his first call with a foreign 

leader, highlighting the strategic importance of the U.S. -Canada relationship. 5 Although both 

leaders called for reinvigorating bilateral cooperation, they are likely to contend with policy 

differences on a range of issues. For example, Prime Minister Trudeau and other Canadian 

officials already have expressed disappointment with Pre sident Biden ’s decision to revoke a 

presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. 6 The Biden Administration also may face 

lingering doubts among Canadians regarding the United States ’ reliability as a long -term partner. 

This report presents an overview of Canada ’s political situation, foreign and defense polic ies , and 

economic and trade polic ies , focusing particularly on issues that may be relevant to U.S. 

policymakers. It also examines several environmental and transboundary issues that may be of 

interest to Members of the 117 th Congress. 

# Politic s and Governance 

Canada is a constitutional monarchy and a parliamentary democracy. Queen Elizabeth II is the 

head of state; s he is represented in Canadian affairs by a governor -general, who is appointed on 

the advice of the prime minister and carries out certain c onstitutional, ceremonial , and 

representational duties . Canada ’s bicameral Westminster -style Parliament includes an e lected, 

338 -seat House of Commons and an appointed, 105 -seat Senate. Members of Parliament are 

elected from individual districts ( ridings ) under a first -past -the -post system, which requires a 

plurality of the vote to win a seat. The governor -general typica lly calls upon the party winning the 

most seats to form a government. A government lasts as long as it can command a parliamentary 

majority for its policies, for a maximum of four years . Under Canada ’s federal system, the 

national government shares power a nd authority with 10 provinces and three territories, each of 

which is governed by a unicameral assembl y.

# Liberal Majority Government: 2015 -2019 

Justin Trudeau has served as Canada ’s prime minister since November 201 5. His Liberal Party 

won a majority in the House of Commons in October 2015 parliamentary elections, defeating 

Prime Minister Stephen Harper ’s Conservative Party, which had held power for nearly a decade. 

The Liberals ’ dominant position enabled them to implement much of their campaign platform. 

During its first four years in office, t he Liberal government enacted a tax cut for middle -income 

families, created a new child benefit to help with the cost of raising children , and increase d

pension and parental leave benefits . The Liberal government also legalized cannabis consumption 

and worked with Canada ’s provinces and territories to develop a national climate change plan that 

impose d a price on carbon emissions .

Although Prime Minister Trudeau and the Liberals initially en joyed high levels of public support ,

their approval ratings gradually declined as they abandoned some campaign pledges, such as 

electoral reform, and sought to balance competing policy priorities. For example, the Liberals 

enacted a carbon tax to reduce GH G emissions but also support ed several pipeline projects to 

transport Canadian oil sands to overseas markets (see “Climate Change ” and “Energy ,” below );

those efforts to reconcile Canada ’s Paris Agreement commitments with its role as a major fossil 

fuel producer drew critici sm from energy producers a nd environmentalists .

A series of ethics scandals further eroded public support for the Liberal government . In December 

2017, Canada ’s conflict of interest and ethics commissioner ruled that Prime Minister Trud eau 

had contravened the country ’s Conflict of Interest Act by accepting two paid family vacations 

from a wealthy philanthropist whose foundation had received funding from the Canadian 

government .7 Prime Minister Trudeau was found to have contravened the act again in August 

20 19 for attempting to influence a decision of the attorney general of Canada regarding a

potential criminal prosecution of the Montreal -based engineering company SNC -Lavalin. 8

# 2019 Election 

The Liberals entered the 2019 election campaign facing increased pu blic scrutiny and polling 

neck and neck with the opposition Conservatives. With unemployment near a 40 -year low , the 

Liberal Party highlighted its legislative accomplishments and argued the election was about 

whether or not Canada would “keep moving forwar d.” 9 Many Canadians remained concerned 

about cost -of -living issues , however, and Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer pledged to 

help Canadians “get ahead .”10 He argued the Liberal government ’s carbon tax had made 

necessities more expensive and claimed four years of deficit spending had failed to improve 

Canadians ’ lives. The Liberal Party also faced pressure from its left, with the New Democratic 

Party (NDP) and the Green Party seeking to win over progressive voters disenchanted with Prime 

Minister Trude au ’s ethics violations and the Liberal Party ’s lack of follow -through on some of its 

more far -reaching 2015 campaign pledges. 

In the end, the Liberals won 157 ridings, leaving the party 13 seats shy of a majority. The Liberal 

Party ’s vote share declined in every province and territory compared with 2015. It lost 29 seats

across the country, including the party ’s only footholds in the oil -producing provinces of Alberta 

and Saskatchewan. The Conservative Party won a plurality of all votes cast nationwide but failed 

to make significant gains in Quebec and Ontario, which hold nearly 60% of the seats in the House 

of Commons (see  Figure 1). As a result, the Conservatives remain the Official Opposition , with 

121 seats. The Bloc Qué bécois, which promotes Quebec sovereignty, surged to a third -place 

finish by winning 32 seats in the province. The Bloc ’s gains came largely at the expense of the 

NDP, which won 24 s eats. The Green Party won three seats, and Prime Minister Trudeau ’s former 

attorney general, who resigned after accusing the prime minister of inappropriate intervention in 

the SNC -Lavalin case, won reelection to parliament as an independent.

# Minority Government and Pandemic Response 

Prime Minister Trudeau has presided over a minority government since the start of the 43 rd 

Parliament in December 2019. As the new term began , it appeared the government ’s primary 

challenge would be to develop policies that would further reduce Canada ’s GHG emissions while 

maintaining economic growth and addressing an increasing sense of political alienation in the 

country ’s western oil -producing provinces .11 The Liberals ’ other stated policy priorities included 

a new tax cut for middle -income families, more stringent gun controls, an expansion of Canada ’s    

> 11 Grant Wyeth, “How Climate Change Could T ear Canada Apart,” World Politics Review , February 13, 2020. Canada -U.S. Relations
> Congressional Research Service 5

universal health care system to cover prescription drugs, and reconciliation with indigenous 

peoples. 12 

Many of those issues were set aside, however, with the onset of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 

(COVID -19) pandemic. The Canadian government confirmed the first documented infection in 

the country on January 27, 2020 , and recorded the first death from the disease on March 9, 2020. 

By late March 2020, the Trudeau government had closed Canada ’s borders to most nonresident s

and imposed a mandatory 14 -day quarantine for individuals returning to the country. The federal 

government also coordinated with provincial and territorial governments —which have 

jurisdiction over health care —to secure personal protective equipment and o ther medical supplies 

and to scale up the country ’s testing and contact -tracing capabilities. The provinces and territories 

have imposed (and lifted) containment measures in accordance with local conditions and the 

federal government ’s broad public health guidelines .

> Source: CRS, Data from Public Health Agency of Canada, “ Public Health Infobase -Data on COVID -19 in
> Canad a,” February 10 , 2021.

Analysts credited those coordinated efforts for initially slowing the spread of the virus (see 

Figure 2). Although provincial health services reportedly experienced some supply shortages, 

they had sufficient capacity to handle the first wave of infections. 13 As conditions improved, 

provincial and territorial governments implemented phased reopening plans that allowed children

to return to school and loosened restrictions on many business and recreational activities. A 

second, larger wave of infections swept through Canada in late 2020, however, le ading provinces 

to reimpose restrictions. As of February 9, 2021, Canada had registered nearly 811,000 cases and 

21,000 deaths from COVID -19. 14 The country ’s COVID -19 daily case rate ( 9.4 new cases per 

100,000 residents) was less than one -third of that of t he United States ( 33 new cases per 100,000 

residents). 15 

The Trudeau government has worked with Parliament to mitigate the economic impact of the 

pandemic and public health measures . Among other programs, the government created the 

Canada Emergency Response Benefit , which provided C$ 2, 000 (approximately $1,538) every 

four weeks to workers who lost their incomes due to COVID -19, and the Canada Emergency 

Wage Subsidy , which cover ed 75% of employees ’ wages, up to C$847 (approximately $652) per 

week , for busines ses that have lost a certain amount of revenue. 16 The emergency response 

bene fit originally was to provide up to 16 weeks of assistance , but the Canadian government 

extended the program to 28 weeks. In September 2020, beneficiaries began transitioning into a 

newly expanded employment insurance system; self -employed and gig workers who do not 

qualify for employment insurance are eligible for a new C$500 (approximately $385) per week 

Canada Recovery Benefit until September 2021 . The Canadian government a lso extended the 

wage subsidy program, originally scheduled to expire in June 2020 , through June 2021. 17 

Prime Minister Trudeau laid out a revised vision for his second term in September 2020, which 

was fleshed out in the government ’s Fall Economic Statemen t 2020 . The Liberal government ’s

top priorities are combatting the pandemic and helping Canadians through the crisis. Among other 

measures, Prime Minister Trudeau pledged to help provinces increase testing, ensure Canadians 

have access to vaccines and ther apeutics, and provide continued financial support to individuals 

and businesses affected by the pandemic and government containment measures. The Canadian 

government has signed agreements with seven vaccine suppliers for enough doses to vaccinate 

the Canad ian population nearly six times over. Production delays have slowed distribution, 

however, and only 2.7% of the Canadian population had received at least one vaccine dose as of 

early February (compared with 10.2% of the U.S. population). 18 

Following the imm ediate crisis, the Liberals argue Canada should take advantage of low interest 

rates to finance economic stimulus measures and address longer -term concerns, such as climate 

change and gaps in Canada ’s social assistance systems. 19 The prime minister will nee d to secure 

the support of opposition parties to enact his agenda. Although Erin O ’Toole, the newly elected 

leader of the Conservative Party, has dismissed many of Prime Minister Trudeau ’s proposals,

NDP leader Jagmeet Singh has indicated his party is prep ared to provide political support to the 

Liberal government as long as the government supports NDP priorities , such as paid sick leave. 20 

The Liberals will need to maintain the NDP ’s support or offset it with support from the Bloc 

Québécois or the Conservative Party to avoid a snap election; recent minority governments have 

lasted just over two years , on average. 21 Popular support for the Liberal Party initially increased 

during the pandemic but declined somewhat after Canada ’s conflict of interest and ethics 

commissioner launched an investigation in July 2020 into the government ’s decision to award a 

contract to a charity with ties to the prime minister ’s family. 22 As of February 8, 2021, polls 

suggested 3 5% of Canadians would support the Libe rals in a new election , 30% would support 

the Conservatives, 18 % would support the NDP, nearly 7 % would support the Bloc Québécois, 

and 6% would support the Green Party. 23 

# Foreign and Defense Policy 

Canada views the rules -based international order that it h elped establish with the United States 

and other allies in the aftermath of World War II as essential to its physical security and economic 

prosperity. According to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance Chrystia Freeland, who 

served as minister of foreign affairs from 2017 to 2019, “As a middle power living next to the 

world ’s only super power, Canada has a huge interest in an international order based on rules. 

One in which might is not always right. One in which more powerful countries are constra ined in 

their treatment of smaller ones by standards that are internationally respected, enforced and 

upheld. ”24 

Historically, Canada has sought to increase its influence over the shape of the international order 

through multilateral diplomacy and contribu tions to collective security alliances . Although t he 

Harper government broke with its predecessors to a certain extent, expressing more skepticism 

toward the United Nations and other international organizations , Prime Minister Trudeau has 

restored Canada ’s traditional approach to foreign affairs. 25 

Over the past four years, much of Prime Minister Trudeau ’s time and attention has focused on 

managing relations with the United States. Maintaining smooth bilateral relations is typically a 

top priority for Canadi an governments , since Canada depends on access to the U.S. market and 

benefits from U.S. investments in continental defense (see “U.S. -Canada Security Cooperation ”) .

That task grew more difficult during t he Trump Administration, however, which challenged many 

long -standing pillars of the U.S. -Canada relationship. In addition to renegotiating NAFTA, 

President Trump raised doubts about the U.S. commitment to NA TO and withdrew from 

multilateral institutions and agreements that both countries previously supported. Prime Minister 

Trudeau generally sought to avoid direct confrontations with the Trump Administration, but

Administration officials made disparaging remarks about Trudeau after the prime minister 

announced his intention to impose retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods in response to the Trump 

Administration ’s decision to impose national security tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum (see 

“Steel and Aluminum Tariffs ,” below ). 26 

U.S. -Canada relations have improved since the conclusion of USMCA negotiations, but many 

Canadians question whether the United States remains a reliable partner. 27 The Trudeau 

government has sought to reduce Canada ’s dependence on the U.S. market by concluding free 

trade agreem ents (FTAs) with the European Union and 10 countries in the Asia -Pacific region 

(see “Ca nada ’s Network of Free Trade Agreements ,” below ). Although the Trudeau government 

also explored a potential FTA with China, talks were suspended due to a sharp deterioration in 

relations (see “Relations with China ,” below ). 

Amid perceptions that the United States seeks to “shrug off the burden of global leadership, ” the 

Trudeau government has sought to work with like -minded countries to uphold the rules -based 

international order .28 In 2019, for example, Can ada joined a coalition of countries led by France 

and Germany to launch the Alliance for Multilateralism —an informal network that seeks to 

protect and preserve international norms, agreements, and institutions; address new challenges 

that require collectiv e action; and reform multilateral institutions and agreements to ensure they 

deliver tangible results to citizens. Canada also is leading a small coalition of World Trade 

Organization (WTO) members, known as the Ottawa Group, to reform the multilateral tra ding 

system. 

As part of its broader efforts to uphold the rules -based order, the Trudeau government has 

reaffirmed Canada ’s commitment to collective security efforts. It unveiled a new defense policy 

in 2017, which asserts that defending Canada and Canadia n interests “not only demands robust 

domestic defense but also requires active engagement abroad. ”29 Among other deployments, 

Canada is contributing to the U.S. -led coalition in Iraq and to NA TO ’s deterrence operations in 

Eastern Europe (see “NA TO Commitments ”). Although Prime Minister Trudeau pledged to 

increase Canada ’s support for U.N. peacekeeping missions, his government ’s contributions have 

been fairly limited , with the exception of a 13 -month deployment of a 250 -member air task force 

to Mali. 30 Some analysts have linked Canada ’s failed bid for a temporary seat on the U.N. 

Security Council for the 2021 -2022 term, in part, to the country ’s comparatively small 

contributions to global peacekeeping and development efforts. 31

# NATO Commitments 

Can ada, like the United States, was a founding member of NA TO in 1949. It maintained a 

military presence in Western Europe throughout the Cold War in support of the collective defense 

pact. Since the 1990s, Canada has supported NA TO ’s adaptation and has been an active 

participant in numerous NA TO operations, includi ng the 1992 intervention in Bosnia and 

Herzegovina, the 1999 bombing campaign in Serbia, and the 2011 intervention in Libya. Canada 

contributed the fifth -largest national contingent to the NA TO -led International Security 

Assistance Force in Afghanistan, be fore withdrawing in 2014. 

Canada commanded NA TO Mission Iraq from its October 2018 inception until November 2020. 

The mission aims to s trengthen Iraqi security institutions and forces by providing noncombat 

advisory, training , and capacity -building suppor t to Iraqi defense officials and military personnel. 

Those efforts complement ed Canada ’s broader contributions to the U.S. -led coalition to defeat the 

Islamic State. Although Prime Minister Trudeau withdrew Canada ’s fighter aircraft from Iraq 

shortly after taking office, he has deployed up to 850 troops to the Middle East to support 

coalition air operations ; provide intelligence support; and train, advise, and assist Iraqi security 

forces. 32 Canada and other NA TO and coalition partners have repositioned many personnel 

outside of Iraq since early 2020 due to a deterioration in the security situation and the COVID -19 

pandemic. 33 Although some troops may return to the Middle East once conditions improve, 

Canada intends to reduce its overall presence in the region .34 

Canada has been an advocate for NA TO enlargement and has deployed Canadian Armed Forces 

personnel to Central and Eastern Euro pe in support of the newest members of the alliance. In 

June 2017, Canada took command of a NA TO battle group deployed to Latvia as part of the 

alliance ’s Enhanced F orward Presence in Eastern Europe. The 1,500 -strong ba ttle group includes 

540 members of the Canadian Armed Forces, as well as troops from Albania, the Czech Republic, 

Italy, Monten egro, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. Th e United States, the United 

Kingdom, and Germany command similar forces in Poland, Estonia, and Lithuania, respectively, 

as part of a broader effort to reassure the alliance ’s eastern members and bolster deter rence in the 

aftermath of Russia ’s annexation of Crimea . Canada also command s a standing NA TO maritime 

group that operates in West ern and Northern European waters .35 

Under the Trudeau government ’s defense policy, Canada is to increase defense spending by 73 %

in nominal terms over 10 years to reach C$32.7 billion (approximately $25.2 billion) in 2026 -

2027. Canada intends to use the additional resources to acquire new aircraft, ships, and other 

equipment; expand the Canadian Armed Forces by 3,500 personnel; an d invest in new 

capabilities. 36 If implemented, Canada ’s total defense spending as a percentage of gross domestic 

product ( GDP ) would reach 1.4% in 2024 -2025, which would fall well short of NA TO ’s

recommended level of at least 2% of GDP. Nevertheless, Canad a would exceed NA TO ’s target of 

investing 20% of defense expenditure in major equipment; such investments would reach 32% of 

defense spending in 2024 -2025. 37 

In 2020, partially due to the sharp economic downturn, Canada ’s estimated defense expenditures 

rea ched approximately 1. 45 % of GDP, with 17.4 % of expenditures dedicated to equipment. 38 

Although the pandemic -driven economic downturn could put pressure on Canada ’s defense 

budget, Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan maintains that expenditures are moving forward as 

planned. 39 Successive U.S. Administrations have pushed Canada to meet the NA TO ta rget, but 

Can ada has long argued that countries ’ contributions to the alliance should be measured more by 

the capabilities and troops they provide than by their defense expenditures as a percentage of 

GDP. 

# Relations with China 

Prime Minister Trudeau ’s gove rnment came to office intending to strengthen ties with China. It 

argued that deeper commercial ties with China were necessary to increase Canada ’s long -term 

economic growth and diversify the country ’s trade relations. The United States is the destination 

of a bout 73% of Canada ’s global merchandise exports, 40 and the Trump Administration ’s trade 

policies reinforced long -standing concerns that Canada is overly dependent on the U.S. market. 

During Prime Minister Trudeau ’s first years in office, Canada joined t he China -backed Asian 

Infrastructure Investment Bank and allowed Chinese companies to acquire some Canadian 

businesses in sensitive sectors. 41 Canada also increased its diplomatic engagement with China and 

engaged in exploratory discussions regarding an ext radition treaty and a n FTA .42 

Chinese -Canadian relations have deteriorated significantly since December 2018, when Canada 

arrested Meng Wanzhou, an executive at the Chinese technology company Huawei, to comply 

with an extradition request from the United Sta tes. A trial to determine whether Meng is to be 

extradited to the United States has been underway since January 2020. The U.S. Department of 

Justice indicted Meng and Huawei for financial fraud involving violations of U.S. sanctions on 

Iran. 43 In apparent r etaliation for Meng ’s arrest, China detained two Canadians, Michael Kovrig, a 

former diplomat, and Michael Spavor, in December 2018. China has held the men in state 

custody for over two years, charging them with espionage in June 2020. 44 China also restrict ed 

imports of certain Canadian agricultural products. Although Chinese officials maintain that 

Canada must ensure Meng ’s safe return to China to avoid further damage to bilateral relations,

Prime Minister Trudeau has criticized China ’s “coercive diplomacy ” and demanded the release of 

the incarcerated Canadians. 45 

The Trump Administration praised Canada for honoring the extradition treaty and upholding the 

rule of law and called on China to end its “arbitrary detention of Canadian citizens. ”46 The Senate 

and the House passed resolutions ( S.Res. 96 and H.Res. 521 , respectively , 116 th Congress )

expressing similar sentiments in 2019. Canadian officials expressed some frustrations, however, 

that the Trump Administration did not push more forcefully for the Canadians ’ release. 47 

Tensions have escalated as Canada has pressed China on human rights issues. In May 2020, 

Ca nada joined with the United States, the United Kingdom (UK) , and Australia to express “deep 

concern ” about China ’s decision to impose a new national security law on Hong Kong. 48 Since 

then, Canada has suspended its extradition treaty with Hong Kong, placed restrictions on 

sensitive exports to Hong Kong, granted asylum to some Hong Kong democracy activists , and 

created a new class of work permit for Hong Kong residents .

Canadian officials also have expressed concerns about China ’s treatment of Uyghurs and ot her 

ethnic minorities in northwest China ’s Xinjiang region. In October 2020, the House of Commons 

Subcommittee on International Human Rights asserted that the situation amounts to genocide and 

called on the Canadian government to impose sanctions on the Ch inese officials responsible. 49 

The Trudeau government has opted not to impose sanctions thus far, but it announced a series of 

measures in January 2021 intended to prevent goods produced through forced labor in Xinjiang 

from entering Canadian supply chains. 50 The Chinese government has pushed back, urging 

Canada to “stop interfering in China ’s internal affairs. ”51 Human rights groups and Canadian 

officials maintain that Chinese government agents also have been directly and indirectly involved 

in harassment and intimidation against pro -democracy and human rights activists in Canada. 52 

The deterioration in relations could influence the Trudeau government ’s decision regarding 

whether to allow Huawei to participate in Canada ’s fifth -generation (5G) telecommunication s

network. The Trump Administration argue d that using Huawei equipment would leave Canada ’s

network vulnerable to espionage and sabotage , since the company ultimately answers to the 

Chinese government —a charge Huawei denies . Several of Canada ’s top telecom munications 

companies use Huawei equipment in their existing networks and are concerned that excluding the

company would raise costs and delay the rollout of 5G technology. 53 The Trudeau government 

has been conducting a national security review of the issue since September 2018 and has not 

issued a timeline for arriving at a decision . Canada is the only member of the Five Eyes alliance 

that has yet to block the use of Huawei equipment, and U.S. officials have warned their Canadian 

counterparts that the decis ion could affect intelligence and defense cooperation .54 According to a 

poll conducted in September 2020, 79% of Canadians view China as a moderate or serious threat 

to Canada. 55 

A provision of the FY2021 Intelligence Authorization Act ( P.L. 116 -260 , Division W, §601) 

require s the directors of the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency, and Defense 

Intelligence Agency to submit a joint report on attempts by China and other foreign adversaries to 

provide telecommunications and cybersecurity equipment and services to Five Eyes countries. 

The report is to assess U.S. intelligence and defense relationships with such countries and to 

consider the po tential for mitigating risks posed by those relationships. 

# U.S. -Canada Security Cooperation 

According to the U.S. State Department, “U.S. defense arrangements with Canada are more 

extensive than with any other country. ”56 In addition to their mutual defense commitments under 

NA TO and close intelligence partnership as members of the Five Eyes alliance , the United States 

and Canada cooperate on continental defense through NORAD and coordinate extensively on law 

enforcement matters, including border security an d cybersecurity. 

North American Aerospace Defense Command 

NORAD i s a cornerstone of U.S. -Canada defense relations. Established in 1958, NORAD 

originally was intended to monitor and defend North America against Soviet long -range bombers. 

The NORAD agreement has been reviewed and revised several times, however, to respond to 

changes in the international security environment. Today, NORAD ’s mission consists of the 

following: 

 Aerospace Warning . P rocessing, assessing, and disseminating intelligence 

related to th e aerospace domain and detecting, validating, and warning of attacks 

against North America , whether by aircraft, missiles, or space vehicles .

 Aerospace Control . P roviding surveillance and exercising operational control 

over U.S. and Canadian airspace .

 Mari time Warning . Processing, assessing, and disseminating intelligence 

related to the maritime areas and internal waterways of the United States and 

Canada, and warning of maritime threats to North America to enable response by 

national commands. 

NORAD is the only binational command in the world. The U.S. commander and the Canadian 

deputy commander of NORAD are appointed by, and responsible to, both the U.S. President and 

the Canadian prime minister. Likewise, NORAD headquarters at Peterson Air Force Base in

Colorado is composed of integrated staff from both countries. This binational structure allows the 

United States and Canada to pool resources, avoiding duplication of some efforts and incr easing 

North America ’s overall defense capabilities. Nevertheless, because the U.S. and Canadian 

governments want to maintain their abilities to take unilateral action, some NORAD 

responsibilities and authorities overlap with those of U.S. Northern Command (NORTHCOM) 

and Canadian Joint Operations Command (CJOC). 

In 2017, President Trump and Prime Minister Trudeau agreed to modernize and broaden the 

NORAD partnership in the air, maritime, cyber, and space domains. 57 NORAD officials maintain 

that the command m ust update its aging systems and develop new capabilities to deter, detect, and 

defeat emerging threats, such as stealthy air - and sea -launched cruise missiles and hypersonic 

glide vehicles. 58 The U.S. and Canadian governments have yet to formalize agreemen ts regarding 

specific expenditures or changes to the command ’s approach to continental defense. 

The Trudeau government ’s defense policy states that Canada will make the investments necessary 

to fulfill the country ’s NORAD obligations and will work with the United States to ensure the 

command is able to meet existing and future challenges. Among other initiatives, the policy calls 

for Canada to purchase 88 fighter aircraft to replace its aging fleet of CF -18s and to collaborat e

with the United States to repl ace the North Warning System —a chain of unmanned radar stations 

in the Arctic that provides aerospace surveillance along the northern approaches to the United 

States and Canada. 59 Canada ’s procurement process for advanced fighters has been delayed for 

more than a decade, and a final contract is not expected to be concluded until 2022. 60 The 

repeated delays have led some analysts to question whether Canada will be able to meet its 

NORAD commitments. 61 Analysts also have questioned Canada ’s decision not to parti cipate in 

ballistic missile defense, which reportedly has complicated command and control by dividing the 

mission between NORAD, which is involved in missile detection and warning, and 

NORTHCOM, which is responsible for the U.S. ballistic missile defense s ystem. 62 

Border Security 

The United States and Canada coordinate extensively on efforts to secure their shared 5,525 -mile 

border. The 2011 “Beyond the Border ” declaration and action plan provide the framework for 

ongoing bilateral cooperation, including eff orts to address potential threats, facilitate legal 

commercial and passenger traffic, enhance cross -border law enforcement cooperation , and 

strengthen and protect critical infrastructure. 63 The declaration and action plan have resulted in 

several initiatives, including

 a 2012 Visa and Immigration Information Sharing Agreement that allows for the 

automated sharing of biograph ic and biometric information; 

 a 2013 entry/ exit program that allows data on entry to one country to serve as a 

record of exit from the other; 

 a 2015 Agreement on Land, Rail, Marine, and Air Transport Preclearance that 

allows customs and immigration officials to clear travelers and cargo in their 

countries of origin; and 

 a 2016 accord that allows for the exchange of information on individuals who 

present a clear threat, including the countr ies ’ respective “no -fly ” lists. 64 

Canadian concerns about privacy and sovereignty delayed implementation of some of the se 

initiatives. 65 Consequently , the United States and Canada did not begin exchanging information 

on all U.S. and Canadian citizens under the entry/ exit program until July 2019 and the Agreement 

on Land, Rail, Marine, and Air Transport Preclearance did not enter into force u ntil August 2019. 

In 2016, Congress enacted the Northern Border Security Review Act ( P.L. 114 -267 ), which 

directed the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct an analysis of threats along 

the U.S. -Canada border. The public summary of the threat analysis, released in July 2017, 

asserted that “the large volume of legitimate travel across the northern border and the long 

stretches of difficult terrain between port s of entry provide potential opportunities for individuals 

who may pose a national security risk to enter the United States undetected. ”66 The analysis also 

noted, however, that encounters with individuals associated with transnational crime or terrorism 

we re infrequent , and total apprehensions of individuals entering the United States from Canada 

between points of entry had remained below 800 per year for the previous five years. DHS 

developed a new Northern Border Strategy in 2018 intended to address the s ecurity challenges 

identified in the threat analysis while facilitating lawful trade and travel. 67 

Although the number of individuals crossing illegally into the United States from Canada 

remained relatively low during the Trump Administration , the number o f individuals crossing 

from the United States into Canada between official ports of entry grew significantly. More than 

56,500 individuals requested asylum in Canada after crossing the border irregularly from 2017 to 

2019 , more than double the number who did so from 2014 to 2016. 68 This northern flow of 

asylum -seekers appears to have been spurred, in part, by the Trump Administration ’s immigration 

policies, such as the termination of Temporary Protected Status for more than 55,000 Haitians, 69 

as well as by Canada ’s image as a sanctuary for refugees after the Trudeau government resettled 

more than 25,000 Syrians in its first 100 days in office. At times, the influx of asylum -seekers

overwhelmed Canada ’s refugee processing system and strained the resources of aid agencies and 

local and provincial governments. 70 

Under a 2002 Safe Third -Country Agreement, which requires individuals to claim protection in 

the first safe country in which they arrive, Canada may immediately return to the United States 

most asylum -seekers who enter throu gh an official border crossing . Those who enter between 

ports of entry, however, generally may remain in Canada while their claims are processed. 71 In 

response to the recent influx, the Canadian government has sought to expand the Sa fe Third 

Country Agreement to cover the entire border. Canadian refugee advocates reject that approach 

and argue the agreement should be suspended to allow asylum -seekers to enter Canada in a safer ,

more orderly fashion. 72 In July 2020, the Federal Court of Canada ruled that Canada ’s laws and 

regulations implementing the Safe Third Country Agreement violate the country ’s Charter of 

Rights and Freedoms based on evidence the United States detains asylum -seekers returned from 

Canada as a penalty for making prot ection claims. 73 Nevertheless, the agreement is to remain in 

place pending the results of the Trudeau government ’s appeal .

The U.S. -Canada border has been closed to all nonessential travel since March 2020, due to the 

COVID -19 pandemic. In addition to prohi biting cross -border travel for recreation or tourism, the 

United States and Canada have agreed to turn back all asylum -seekers —effectively applying the 

Safe Third Country Agreement along the length of the border for the duration of the health crisis. 

Some Members of Congress have called for the U.S. and Canadian governments to loosen travel 

restrictions, which have disproportionate ly impact ed residents of border communities. The 

Trudeau government has made some changes to allow international students and in dividuals 

reuniting with family to cross the border but has stated that most restrictions will remain in place 

until health conditions improve substantially. 74 

Cybersecurity 

Both the United States and Canada rely on information technology as a strategic na tional asset 

that reaps many economic and societal benefits. This increasing reliance on i nternet -based 

systems has created new sets of vulnerabilities. Attacks on critical infrastructure, online influence 

campaigns, and the t heft of digitally stored information, either for military or economic 

competitive advantage, are growing areas of concern for both countries. In 2014, for example, the 

Canadian government accused China of carrying out a cyberattack on the National Research 

Council, Canada ’s largest federal research and development organization. It reportedly took more 

than 16 months and C$100 million (approximately $77 million) for the Canadian government to 

mitigate the damage and rebuild the council ’s networks .75 In the pa st two years, Russia -associated 

actors reportedly have probed the networks of U.S. and Canadian electric utilities and carried out

malicious cyber activities against U.S. and Canadian research entities involved in the 

development of a COVID -19 vaccine. 76 

Re cognizing the scope of the threat, the Trudeau government ’s 2 018 and 2019 budgets included 

nearly C$ 1 billion (approximately $769 million) over five years to implement a new National 

Cyber Security S trategy. 77 Those funds allowed Canada to consolidate opera tional cyber expertise 

from across the federal government in a new Canadian Center for Cyber Security, housed within 

the country ’s signals intelligence agency, the Communications Security Establishment (CSE ). 

The funds also supported the establishment of a new National Cybercrime Coordination Unit 

within the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to serve as a hub for cybercrime investigations. 

Although the new cybersecurity strategy focuses largely on protecting Canadians and critical 

government and private sector systems, the Trudeau government ’s defense policy argues that “a

purely defensive cyber posture is no longer sufficient. ”78 The Canadian Armed Forces intend to 

develop “active cyber capabilities ” to be employed against potential adversaries in support of 

go vernment -authorized military missions. 79 The CSE also may conduct “active ” cyber operations ;

provisions enacted as part of a 2019 overhaul of Canada ’s foreign intelligence and cybersecurity 

laws (Bill C -59) authorize the CSE “to degrade, disrupt, respond to or interfere with the 

capabilities, intentions or activities of a foreign individual , state, organization or terrorist group as 

they relate to international affairs, defence or security. ”80 Some analysts argue that Canada ’s shift 

toward offensive cyber ope rations carries new risks and that Canada needs to clarify how it 

intends to use the new capabilities .81 

U.S. -Canada cooperation on cybersecurity is long -standing, both bilaterally and as members of 

the Five Eyes alliance. In 2012, DHS and Public Safety Canada approved a Cybersecurity Action 

Plan focused on strengthening cyber infrastructure on both sides of the border. The plan outlined 

a series of joint commitments intended to enhance collaboration on cyber incident management, 

increase engagement and information sharing with the private sector, and coordinate public 

awareness efforts. 82 Both countries also committed to strengthening their cybersecurity 

capabilities and collaboration in the digital trade chapter of USMCA. Other bilateral efforts are 

focused on preventing, responding to, and recovering from critical infrastructure disruptions, 

including those caused by cy berattacks. 83 Although Canada has yet to adopt a comprehensive 

approach toward the international aspects of cybersecurity, its positions typically have aligned 

with those of the United States. In September 2019, for example, Canada joined the United States

# Economic and Trade Policy 

As an open economy dependent on world trade, Canada is significantly affected by the global 

economy and by its largest trading partner, the United States . (See  Table 1 for comparative 

economic statistics). Like other economies around the world, Canada has experienced a steep 

contraction due to the COVID -19 pandemic. Although Canada recorded an anemic 1.7% growth 

rate in 201 9, its average growth in the 10 years since the end of the 2008 -2009 global financial 

crisis was a modest 2. 2%. Canada ’s GDP declined by 0.9% in the first quarter of 2020, 13.0 % in 

the second quarter , and a further 5.2% in the third quarter (see  Figure 3). F orecasters predict a 

yearly 2020 average decline of 5.7 % (IHS Markit Intelligence [IHS]) to 5.8 % (Economist 

Intelligence Unit [ EIU ]), but they expect a rebound of 4.0% (EIU) to 4.6 % (IHS) in 2021. 

Canadian unemployment rose from a gener ational low of 5.6% in 2019 to 13.7% in May 2020. It 

has fall en gradually since , and both forecasters expect a 2020 year ly average of 9.5 %.85

# Budget Policy 

The Canadian government ’s response to the COVID -19 crisis, discussed above ( see “Minority 

Government and Pandemic Response ”), has swollen the current budget deficit and forecasts for 

future deficits (see  Figure 4). On November 30, 2020, Department of Finance Canada released its 

Fall Economic Statement 2020 , which forecast the deficit to hit C$381.6 billion (approximately 

$294 bill ion) in the 2020 -2021 fiscal year, a tenfold increase from 2019 and amounting to nearly 

a fifth of Canada ’s forecast GDP for 2020. 86 According to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of 

Finance Chrystia Freeland, as of November 30, 2020, the Canadian governme nt had spent C$322 

billion (approximately $248 billion) on direct measures to fight COVID -19 and provide support 

to individuals, along with C$85 billion (approximately $65 billion) in tax and duty deferrals. 87 

The expanding budget deficit does not appear t o have constrained the government ’s recovery 

plans. In the Fall Economic Statement 2020 , the government announced a COVID -19 recovery 

stimulus plan costing C$70 -C$100 billion (approximately $54 -$77 billion) to “build Canada out 

of this recession towards an economy that is cleaner, more inclusive, more innovative, and more 

competitive. ”88 The government maintains that “fiscal guardrails ”—described as the

unemployment rate and other labor -related metrics —will determine the length of the stimulus. 89 

The next bud get , due in March 2021 , likely will detail the various programs and expenditures.

Government debt has been a sensitive political issue in Canada for generations (see text box, 

below). The Canadian government maintains that historically low borrowing costs and the lowest 

federal government debt -to -GDP ratio among the Group of Seven (G -7) facilitate its fiscal 

plans. 90 Others take a different view ; Fitch, the credit rating agency, downgraded Canada ’s

sovereign debt from AAA to AA+ in June 2020. 91 It note d that Canada ’s general government debt 

(federal and provincial) is expected to rise to 115.1% of GDP in 2020 from 88.3% of GDP in 

2019. International Monetary Fund projections indica te Canada suffered the worst deterioration in 

government finances among advanced countries , with the deficit representing 19.6% of the 

economy in 2020 .92 Some commentators fear the additional debt burden will have a negative 

impact on the eventual econom ic recovery when added to existing structural impediments , such 

as low productivity in the economy and continued weakness in the oil and gas sector. 93

Debt and Deficits: The Canadian Experience 

In 1993, a ft er  27 straight years of deficit spending  by both Liberal and Conservative governments  prior to  an 

“austerity” budget  in  1995, Canada’s public debt reached a peak of 101.6% of  gross domestic product ( GDP ) and 

government sector spending reached 53.6% of GDP. Realizing this course was unsustainable , the Liberal 

government of Prime Minister Jean Chrétien and his  finance  minister , Paul Martin , embarked on a financial 

austerity plan in 1995 , using such politically risky measures as cutting federal funding for health and education 

transfers, applying a  means test to those eligible for Seniors Benefits, and cut ting  defense  spending . Modest tax 

increases also  were  employed, mostly through closing loopholes. Under this budget discipline, the government 

submitted a balanced budget in 1998 and a political con  sensus emerged not to resort to deficit spending .

However, in the face of the global financial crisis in 2009,  the Conservative government of Prime Minister Stephen 

Harper introduced a budget package of stimulus spending and tax cuts,  producing a fiscal de ficit for the first time 

in a decade. 

From  2009 to  2015, the Conservative government ran deficits ; the deficit  reach ed  5% of GDP in 2010 but ,

through austerity and improved economic conditions , was  steadily whittled down to 1.9% of GDP by 2015. The 

Harper  government  sought to return  Canada to fiscal balance by the 2015 election, resorting to certain one -off 

savings , such  as selling embassies and liquidating (literally) gold coin s found in the Bank of Canada vaults. 

Ultimately, a sluggish economy thwarted th ose plans and the last Harper budget in 2015 left a C$3 billion 

(approximately $2.3 billion)  deficit. 

During the 2015 election, Justin Trudeau upended Canadian political orthodoxy by campaigning on a targeted 

budget deficit —C$10 billion  (about $7.7 billion ) per  year for three years —for infrastructure projects to stimulate 

a sluggish economy reeling from the commodity and energy  price  collapse  at mid -decade. This electoral gambit 

paid  off at the polls,  and the Trudeau government has consistently resorted to  deficits to fund its programs.

# Monetary Policy 

Since the 2008 -2009 global financial crisis, the United States and Canada have maintained 

accommodative monetary polic ies. The Bank of Canada (BOC) kept its interest rate at 1% from 

September 2010 until 2 015 ; the BOC lowered it s rate twice that year, in January and July ,

ultimately to 0.5 %. Subsequently, the BOC gradually raised its benchmark rate to a high of 1.75% 

in October 2018. In response to the COVID -19 crisis, the BOC lowered its key rate three times in 

March 2020 to 0.25%, where it has remained since (see  Figure 5). In addition, the BOC is 

engaged in quantitative easing by buying up to $4 billion in Canadian government bonds per 

week. The key rate is not expected to rise until at least 2022. 94

The value of the Canadian dollar (or loonie , its nickname ) has varied in terms of the U.S. dollar in 

recent years , often as a result of the demand for commodities (see  Figure 6). Prior to the global 

financial crisis of 2008 -2009 , the Canadian dollar was nearly at parity, trading at slightly less than 

the U.S. dollar. During the financial crisis , the Canadian dollar dropped to a monthly average of 

C$1.26/U .S.$1. As the economy stabilized and demand for commodities and energy resumed, the 

Canadian dollar appreciated again to parity, reaching C$0.96/U .S.$1 in July 2011. As oil prices 

dropped and the commodity boom ended, the Canadian dollar began to depreciat e; its decline 

accelerated with the BOC ’s reduc tion of interest rates from 1.0% to 0.5 % in 2015. The Canadian 

dollar hit a low of C$1.42/ U.S.$1 in January 2016. The currency has since rebounded with higher 

interest rates but has not appreciated above C$1.2 0/U .S.$1. 

The strength of the Ca nadian dollar from roughly 2002 to 2008 and roughly 2010 to 2013 had a 

detrimental effect on Ca nadian manufacturing, as export -dependent goods became relatively 

uncompetitive in world markets. The Canadian auto industry was especially hard hit , as the center 

of gravity of U.S. production has moved south and new North American investment has bypassed 

Canada for the United States and, especially, Mexico. 95 Since the end of the commodities boom, 

the loonie has depreciated from it s generational highs and manufacturing has picked up, but, as 

with the United States, manufacturing represents a declining share of GDP.

# Investment 

The U.S. -Canada economic relationship is characterized by substantial ownership interests in 

each nation by investors of the other. The United States is the largest single investor in Canada ,

with a stock of $402.3 billion in 2019, a figure representing 6.8% of total U.S. foreign direct 

investment (FDI) abroad. U.S. investors accounted for 46.7 % of FDI in Canada in 2019 , with 

manufacturing, finance/insurance, and mining/energy comprising the t hree largest categories of 

U.S. FDI. Canada had the third -largest FDI position in the United States in 2019 at $495.7 billion, 

11.1% of the total FDI stock in the United States in that year , trailing only the United Kingdom 

and Japan. The United States is the most prominent destination for Canadian FDI, with a stock of 

45.4% of total Canadian FDI abroad in 2019. 96 

Foreign investment has played a large part in the development of the Canadian economy. British 

and American capital was instrumental in building Canada ’s railways in the 19 th century and in 

exploiting its resources in the 20 th century . Although Canada generally is open to foreign 

investment, certain restrictio ns exist . Investment is monitored , and some types of FDI are 

reviewed ; for example, “signi ficant investments in Canada by non -Canadians ” are reviewed 

unde r the Investment Canada Act to ensure “net benefit ” to Canada. All transactions involving 

uranium production, financial services, transportatio n services, or cultural industries must be 

review ed. 97 Net benefit is assessed on such factors as

 effect on the level of economic activity in Canada , including employment; 

 degree or significance of participation by Canadians; 

 effect o n productivity and technological development; 

 effect on competition; 

 effec t on Canadian competitiveness in world markets; and 

 compatibility with national, industrial, or cultural policies. 

Acquisitions by foreign state -owned enterprises are subject to additional scrutiny to assess 

whether they meet the net -benefit test. The additional criteria include whether the state -owned 

enterprise adheres to Canadian standards of corporate governance and whether the Canadian 

business acquired will continue to have the ability to operate on a commercial basis . A transaction 

also may b e reviewed if it raises national security concerns. The 2021 net benefit review 

threshold for parties to the WTO is C$1.043 billion (approximately $802 million) . The threshold 

for FTA partners, including the United States, is C$1.565 billion (approximately $1.2 billion), and 

the threshold for state -owned enterprises is C$415 million (approximately $319 million) .98 

# U.S. -Canada Trade Relations 

The United States and Canada enjoy one of the largest bilateral commercial relationship s in the 

world. Over the past 30 years, U.S. -Canada trade relations have been governed first by the 1989 

U.S. -Canada Free Trade Agreement, then by NAFTA, and since July 1, 2020 , by USMCA . The 

two countries were leaders in the creation of the open, rules -based multilateral trading system 

characterized by mutual concessions on market access for goods and services, disciplines on trade 

restrictions, and binding dispute -settlement mechanisms. Both countries were founding members 

of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the genesis of t he postwar multilateral trading 

system, and were among the founding members of the WTO. 

However, some have called this trading system into question due to developments under the 

Trump Administration, including the Administration ’s imposition of unilateral tariff measures, 

withdrawal from the Trans -Pacific Partnership (TPP) regional trade agreement, and skepticism of 

multilateralism. President Biden has pledged to reinvigorate bilateral cooperation and strengthen 

economic ties , as well as multilateral insti tutions .99 Nonetheless, his early decision to cancel the 

Keystone XL pipeline project and his commitment to Buy American policies have caused concern 

in Canada. 

The volume of economic activity across the border underscores the extent of economic 

integration between the United States and Canada. The two nations have one of the largest trading 

relationships in the world , with $1. 4 billion of goods cross ing the border daily in 20 20 . Canada 

remained the largest purchaser of U.S. goods in 2020 , accounting for 1 2.0% of total U.S. 

merchandise exports . Canada also was the third -largest supplier of U.S. imports in 2020 ,

accounting for 11.6 % of total U.S. merchandise imports. The United States is Canada ’s largest 

goods export destination and import supplier. In 20 20 , the United States supplied 48.9 % of 

Canadian goods imports and was the destination of 73.8 % of Canadian goods exports. Total two -

way trade (goods and services) between Canada and the United States represented nearly 37.6%

of Canadian GDP in 2019 (2020 serv ices trade data are not yet available) . The United States ran a 

goods trade d eficit of nearly $15 billion with Canada in 20 20. In 2019, the U.S. goods deficit was 

$26.8 billion but was offset by a $29.1 billion services trade surplus for an overall surplus of $2.3 

billion. 100  Table 2 describes the composition of imports and exports between the United States

Trade between the United States and Canada dropped substantially in 2020 from pre -COVID -19 

levels. Overall, total trade in 2020 dropped 14.1% from 2019. Exports to Canada fell 12.8% , and 

imports from Canada dropped 15.3%. Trade in individual commodities reflected these drop s. 

However, U.S. exports of low -value shipments, which incl udes shop -at -home, mail -order, and 

goods purchased through e -commerce, increased 36.1% in 2020, likely due to COVID -19

restrictions. Conversely, imports of softwood lumber increased by 41.2% due to the ongoing 

housing boom in the United States. 

The United States also conducts substantial services trade with Canada. In 2019, Canada was both 

the second -largest consumer of U.S. services and the second -largest supplier of services to the 

United States. That year, the United States exported $67.7 billi on worth of services to Canada and 

imported $38.6 billion, for a surplus of $29.1 billion. Services exports to Canada accounted for 

7.7% of U.S. service exports overall; imports represented about 6.6% of total U.S. service 

imports. Leading services exports to Canada included travel, profession al and management 

services, intellectual property (computer software, audio visual) , and education services. 101 In 

2019, U.S. service exports represented 54.2% of Canadian service imports and Canadian service 

exports to the United States represented 56.3% of total Canadian service exports. 102 U.S. travelers 

accounted for 33.1% of Canada ’s trave l and tourism receipts in 2019; Canadians spent 54.3 % of 

their tourist dollars in the United States that year .

United States -Mexico -Canada Agreement 

In May 2017, the Trump Administration sent notification to Congress of its intent to begin talks 

with Canada and Mexico to renegotiate NAFTA. Following the 90 -day consultation period with 

Congress mandated under Trade Promotion Autho rity (TPA), negotiations began in August 2017. 

Initially, much of the discussion revolved around revising and modernizing the nearly 25 -year -old 

accord. All three parties alluded to incorporating new or expanded language from the TPP 

negotiations on e -commerce, intellectual property rights (IPR) , investment, labor, environment, 

sanitary and phytosanitary standards, state -owned enterprises, data flows, and data localization —

requirements to maintain data in country. At times during the negotiations, President Trum p

threatened to withdraw from NAFTA. The overall gist of U.S. proposals appeared to be aimed at 

reducing bilateral trade deficits with Canada and Mexico and returning manufacturing jobs to the 

United States. To that end, the Administration tabled some prop osals that Canada and Mexico 

considered unacceptable or unworkable and subsequently dropped those proposals in the 

negotiations. On most issues, the negotiating dynamic generally pitted the United States against 

Canada and Mexico, which were more intereste d in modernizing the agreement and opposed 

proposals that would restrict trade. 

Initial deadlines to conclude the talks were not met, but the United States and Mexico concluded 

an agreement on August 30, 2018, allowing the President to provide a 90 -day no tice to sign an 

agreement under TPA on November 30, 2018. The United States and Canada subsequently 

reached agreement in September 2018 , and a draft text was released. On November 30, 2018, 

President Trump, President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico, and Prime Minister Trudeau signed 

USMCA .

With the change in control in the House of Representatives in the 116 th Congress, Members of the 

House Ways and Means Committee and the Trump Administration negotiated changes to several 

aspects of the agreement. On December 10, 2019, the United States, Canada, and Mexico agreed 

to a protocol of amendment to the original USMCA text. The revisions include modifications to 

key elements of the original text regarding dispute settlement, labor and environmental 

provisions, IPR pr otection, and steel and aluminum requirements in the motor vehicle industry ’s

rules of origin. The revised agreement provides for a facility -specific rapid response labor 

mechanism to address worker rights provisions. 

Implementing legislation was introduce d i n the House of Representatives (H.R. 5430 , 116 th 

Congress ) and in the Senate ( S. 3052 , 116 th Congress ) in December 2019 . The legislation was 

approved by the House in December 2019 , by a vote of 385 -41 and by the Senate in January 

2020 , by a vote of 89 -10. President Trump signed the legislation ( P.L. 116 -113 ) on January 29, 

2020. The agreement entered into force on July 1, 2020. 

USMCA maintains most of the existing, largely tariff -free trade created by NAFTA. It provides 

additional incremental market access in agriculture pro ducts with Canada, changes the 

automotive rules of origin, updates some provisions of NAFTA, and adds new chapters 

concerning digital trade and state -owned enterprises. The following are some key outcomes of 

relevance to Canada. 103 The agreement 

 Tightens a ut omotive rules of origin (ROO) . To receive preferential treatment, 

autos and auto parts must contain 75% USMCA content, up from 62.5% for autos 

and 60% for auto parts in NAFTA. In addition, 70% of the steel and aluminum in 

auto s and auto parts must be of US MCA origin and 40 %-45% of auto content 

must be made by workers making at least $16 per hour. This last provision was 

supported by Canada, which has a similar wage structure to the United States, 

although the overall impact of the ROO changes is uncertain. 

 Provides limited tariff -rate quota increases for U.S. exports of dairy, poultry, 

and egg products to Canada. Canada also removed its “Class 7” pricing for ultra -

high filtration milk. 104 In return, the United States expand ed access to Canadian 

dairy, sugar, peanuts , and cotton. 105 

 Eliminates the investor -state dispute s ettlement (ISDS) mechanism between 

the United States and Canada to enforce alleged violations of investor protection 

in the investment chapter of the agreement. Canada supported this U.S. proposal. 

The agreement m aintains a more limited U.S. -Mexico ISDS mechanism .

 Retains the NAFTA binational review mechanism for antidumping and 

countervailing duty national administrative decisions. The Un ited States sought 

the elimination of this review mechanism , whereas Canada supported its 

retention as a priority issue. 

 Restricts the government procurement chapter to procurement between the 

United States and Mexico. U.S. -Canada procurement continues to be governed 

by the existing WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) to which both 

countries are party. However, the agreement does not specific ally reference the 

GPA. 

 Expands IPR provisions to include the following :

 Extension of copyright term to 70 years after the death of an author or 

creator (Canada previously provided 50 years )

 Expansion of patent and regulatory protections for pharmaceuticals 

(h owever, extension of exclusivity periods for biologic drugs was 

dropp ed from the originally negotiated agreement )

 Prohibitions on circumvention of technological protection measures 

 Criminal and civil penalties protections for trade -secret theft, including 

by state -owned enterprises and cybertheft 

 Copyright safe -harbor provi sions on internet service provider liability 

 Continued exclusion of Canadian cultural industries from national 

treatment and most -favored -nation treatment 

New provisions in USMCA include the following :

 A digital trade chapter to allow for cross -border dat a flows and to restrict data 

localization 

 Binding obligations on currency manipulation 

 A sunset clause requiring a joint review and agreement on renewal of USMCA 

after 6 years, or the agreement would expire in year 16 

 Enforceable disciplines on state -owned enterprises 

 Possibility for a party to withdraw from the agreement if another party enters into 

an FTA with a country it deems to be a nonmarket economy (e.g., China) 106 

Canada also was broadly supportive of the additional labor and environmental protections 

negotiated between the Trump Administration and Congress. 

Ca nada ’s Network of Free Trade Agreements 

In addition to USMCA, Canada has FTAs with several other countries. It signed the TPP FTA 

and , following the Trump Administration ’s withdrawal from the accord, negotiated a successor 

agreement, known as the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans -Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) ,

with 10 other TPP members. CPTPP, which came into effect on Decemb er 20, 2018, provide s

Canada preferential market access for agriculture and livestock to several luc rative Asian 

markets, including Japan. However, this advantage was somewhat diminished after Japan signed 

a bilateral trade agreement with the United States in October 2019 affording the United States 

similar access to Japan ’s agricultural markets. 107 

Canada ’s Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreemen t (CETA) with the EU provisionally 

came into force on September 21, 2017. This agreement provides preferential m arket access for 

goods and certain services (including agriculture) , among other provisions , such as provisions on 

geographical indications —geographical names that protect the quality and reputation of a 

distinctive product originating in a certain region. For instance, Canada agreed to recognize 

geographical indications on certain cheeses generally viewed as common food names in the 

United St ates, leading to concerns in the U.S. dairy industry about U.S. market access in Canada. 

In a change from most U.S. FTAs —and previous European FTAs —CETA established an

investment court system with an appellate mechanism to resolv e disputes arising from CETA ’s

investment chapter instead of relying on ISDS. USMCA ’s digital trade chapter has more 

expansive commitments than CETA, such as prohibitions on data localization and restrictions on 

impediments to cross -border data flows. Those prohibitions, in turn, may affect Canada ’s ability 

to maintain its adequacy determination in the EU ’s General Data Protection Regulation. 108 

To replicate CETA with the UK following its departure from the EU, Canada and the UK 

negotiated a Trade Continuity Agreement (TCA). Signed on December 9, 2020, the TCA rolls 

over the provisions of CETA and may serve as a bridge for a comprehensive bilateral FTA , which 

the two sides hope to negotiate within three years. 109 In addition, Canada has FTAs in force with 

South Korea and with several countries in Central and South America .

Disputes 

U.S. -Canada trade relations took on a different tone during the Trump Administration than during 

previous U.S. Administrations . Whether it was the reemergence of old irritants , such as trade in 

softwood lumber and dairy restrictions ; the emergence of new disp utes , such as Section 232 

tariffs on steel or aluminum ; or the presence of contentious USMCA negotiations, the commercial 

relationship be tween the two nations faced new cha llenges. Perhaps c haracteristic of his 

sentiments, President Trump commented on the various trade disputes in a June 2018 tweet ,

writing “Canada ha s treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long 

period of time. Highly restrictive on Trade! They must open their markets and take down their 

trad e barriers! They report a real high surplus on trade with us. Do Timber & Lumber i n U.S.? ”

The Biden Administration may take a less confrontational approach to trade relations with 

Canada. However, some long -standing issues , such as softwood lumber, Canadian dairy access, 

and IPR protections , may see further activity in 2021 and remain of congressional interest. 

Softwood Lumber 

Trade in softwood lumber , now in its fifth iteration of litigation, traditionally has been one of the 

most controversial topics in the U.S. -Canada trading relationship . The dispute revolves around 

different pricing policies and forest management structures in the two countries . In Canada, most 

forests are owned by the Canadian provinces as Crown lands ; in the United States, most forests 

are privately held. The Canadian provinces allocate timber to producers under long -term tenure 

agreements and charge a stumpage fee , which U.S. producers maintain is not determined by 

market forces but rather acts as a subsidy to promote the Canadian industry, sectoral employment, 

or regio nal development. Canada denies that its timber management practices constitute a subsidy 

and maintains that it has a comparative advantage in timber and a more efficient industry than the 

United States .

Until October 2015, trade in softwood lumber was gove rned by a seven -year agreement —reached 

in 2006 and subsequently extended for two years , to 2015 —restricting Canadian exports to the 

United States. As part of a complicated formula, the United States allowed unlimited imports of 

Canadian timber when market prices remain ed above a specified level; when prices fell below

that level, Canada imposed export taxes and/or quotas. In addition, the United States returned to 

Canada a large majority of the duties it had collected from previous trade remedy cases. 

The c urrent dispute (Lumber V) started when the 2006 agreement expired. After a year -long grace 

period, a coalition of U.S. lumber producers filed trade remedy petitions on November 25, 2016, 

which claimed that Canadian firms dump lumber in the U.S. market and Canadian provincial 

forestry policies subsidize Canadian lumber production. These petitions subsequently were 

accepted by the two U.S. agencies that administer the trade remedy process: the International 

Trade Commission (ITC) and the Department of Commerc e’s International Trade Administration 

(ITA). 

On December 7, 2017, the ITC determined imports of softwood lumber, which ITA had 

previously determined to be dumped and subsidized, caused material injury to U.S. producers. 

This finding mean t ITA ’s final dut ies in the antidumping and countervailing duty proceedings, 

announced on November 2, 2017, c ould be imposed on affected Canadian lumber. ITA found 

subsidization of the Canadian industry and determined a subsidy margin of 3.34% -18.19% on 

Canadian lumber, de pending on the firm. ITA found dumping margins of 3.20% -8.89%, also firm 

dependent. The antidumping and countervailing duties were imposed on January 3, 2018. 

Canada challenged these trade remedy decisions at the WTO and at NAFTA/USMCA 

antidumping and cou ntervailing duty binational review panels. Canada challenged the 

consistency of the antidumping and countervailing duties with applicable WTO agreements, and 

panels were established in April 2018. 110 In the antidumping case, a WTO panel ruled in an April 

201 9 split decision that ITA calculated dumping margins in a manner inconsistent w ith the WTO 

Anti -Dumping Agreement but ruled that the methodology used by ITA was consistent with the 

WTO agreement .111 Canada appealed the ruling to the Appellate Body in June 20 19. Another 

panel issued a report in the countervailing duty case in August 2020. 112 The panel decided the 

United States violated the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures by 

improperly rejecting Canadian use of benchmark prices for softwood lumber in various 

provinces. The United States appealed this decision in September 2020. Both appeals currently 

are in limbo in the voi d of the nonfunctioning appellate body. 

Canada also is challenging the duties under the USMCA Chapter 10 bilateral review mechanism. 

The purpose of this review is to determine whether the administrative review bodies ( ITA and 

ITC ) adhere to U.S. law and regulation in making those determinations. On December 14, 2020, 

Canada filed its first request for panel review under the USMCA mechanism to challenge the 

countervailing duties on Canadian lumber. 113 Canada also challenged the duties under the 

previous NAFT A binational panel . Canada filed challenges to the final affirmative countervailing 

duty determination in November 2017 , and to the final affirmative antidumping determination in

December 2017 . In September 2019, the panel found the ITC erre d in the method ology and data it

ITC to reevaluate its data. 114 

Dairy 

On December 9, 2020, the office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) sought its first 

consultation under U SMCA ’s Chapter 31 state -state dispute mechanism on dairy access under the 

agreement. Although USMCA did not end Canada ’s supply management system for dairy, 

poultry, and eggs (see text box, below), it provided limited tariff -rate quota (TRQ) increases for 

U.S. exports. In distributing the additional quotas, USTR allege d Canada retained a portion of the 

quota for domestic processors and further processors, which USTR maintain ed violates USMCA. 

According to USTR, “this restriction undermines the value of Canada ’s TRQs for U.S. producers 

and exporters by limiting their access to in -quota quantities negotiated under the USMCA. ”115 

Under the dispute mechanism, parties initially enter into consultations to resolve the dispute. If 

these consultations are not successful, a party may request the establishment of a panel no earlier 

than 75 days after the initial request for consultation. 

Supply Management for Dairy, Poultry, and Eggs 

Canada  uses supply management to support its dairy, poultry, and egg sectors.  Although the  United States -

Mexico -Canada Agreement  (USMCA ) provided greater access to these markets, it did not dismantle the system. 

Supply  management’s  main features (1) provide pric e support to producers based on their production costs and 

return on equity and management, (2) limit production to meet domestic demand at the cost  -determined price, 

and (3) restrict imports to protect against foreign competition. The Canadian government  has supported 

producers’ decisions to use this approach for more than 40 years, and  it  succeeded in limiting imports of these 

products in negotiating the U.S. -Canada Free Trade Agreement ; NAFTA ; USMCA ; its multilateral commitments in 

the Uruguay Round’s Ag reement on Agriculture ; and , for the most part, its bilateral free trade agreements. 

National bodies and provincial commodity marketing boards, granted statutory powers by the federal and 

provincial governments, control the supply management systems for th  ese commodities. At the national level, the 

amount of each commodity that producers can market is controlled by a quota system. Imports of each 

commodity are limited by tariff -rate quotas. These  quotas  allow a specified amount to enter annually under 

Canad a’s trade commitments at little or zero duty but apply a very high tariff (over 200% in many cases) on 

imports above the specified level or quota amount. Both tools work together to control the supply of each 

commodity, but the objective is to ensure produ cers receive a price that guarantees them a return that covers 

their production costs. The quota is set to balance supply with demand at that price and is frequently adjusted to 

ensure this balance is achieved. Producers of these commodities must participa te in their respective supply 

management systems, with farm -level production subject to individual quota limits that can be sold  only  into 

permitted marketing channels. 

Producers of these commodities point out the benefits of the supply management approach  , which they say has 

significantly reduced price volatility. The stability of prices over time, combined with the guarantee that covers 

production costs, has provide d income support. Others  note  that these features have resulted in the lack of 

market orien tation for these commodities, as the value of supply management has become capitalized, or 

incorporated, into the value of the quota. In other words, those who hold quota (i.e., renting it out) benefit more 

than the producers themselves. Conversely, consum ers end up paying more for these products , and some 

Canadians near the border cross over to the United States for their milk and egg runs.

Intellectual Property Rights 

Canada has been placed on USTR ’s Special 301 “watch list ,” or priority watch list , for IPR 

protections every year since 2013 .116 In 2018, Canada enacted its Copyright Modernization Act, 

which implemented the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty and 

Performance and Phonograms Treat y.117 The act is analogous to the U.S. Digital Millennium 

Copyright Act ( P.L. 105 -304 ). The Canadian act allow ed for some format shifting (right to 

copy/back up for private purposes) and fair -dealing (fair -use) exceptions for legitimate purposes 

(e.g., news, teaching, and research) but prohibit ed the circumvention of digital protection 

measures. It also clarified the rights and responsibilities of i nternet service providers regarding 

infringement of their subscri bers and provide d for a “notice -and -notice system ” to warn potential 

infringers. 

In 2020, Canada remained on USTR ’s watch list, its mildest category of rebuke. 118 Many 

concerns in previous Special 301 reports were ameliorated by the implementation of USMCA. 

IPR provisions in USMCA affecting Canada include the following :

 Lengthening copyright terms to 70 years from 50 years in force in Canada 

 Authority for ex officio seizure of counterfeit and pirated goods at the border or 

in transit ; Canada has legislated th e former, but not the latter 

 “Meaningful ” penalties for technological circumvention measures 

 New transparency requirements for geographical indications 

 Patent term restoration and patent linkage provisions 

As a result of the CETA, Canada revamped its regulations on patent term restoration and patent 

linkage. Canada is to provide two years of patent term restoration if marketing authorization takes 

longer than five years from the filing of a basic patent. The additional patent protection applies 

only to the pharmaceutical product covered by the marketing authorization, not by subsequent 

modifications of uses, methods, or processes. In the 2018 Special 301 Report , USTR called the 

changes “disappointingly limite d in duration, eligibility, and scope of protection. ”119 

Canada also changed its patent linkage system to comply with CETA, which was a long -standing 

goal of the United States. Under Canada ’s previous system, the Patent Medicines (Notice of 

Compliance) regulations, a generic drug maker could seek marketing approval by challenging the 

validity of the patent and claiming noninfringement. The system allowed a patent owner to apply 

to federal court to keep a generi c company ’s potentially infringing medicine off the market. 

However, the burden of proof was on the patent holder, and if the appeal was unsuccessful, a 

notice of compliance was issued, rendering moot any further challenge to the authorization. A 

patent ho lder could start again by launching a patent infringement lawsuit, with the resultant 

duplication of effort. As of September 21, 2017, Canada replaced that system with a single -track

process resulting in final determinations of patent infringement and vali dity, providing both sides 

with equivalent rights of appeal. 120 

The 2020 Special 301 Report drew attention to Canada ’s Patent Medicine Prices Review Board 

(PMPRB), especially to updates to the board ’s guidelines scheduled to enter into force on July 1, 

2021 . The PMPRB is an independent quasi -judicial body es tablished by Parliament under the 

Patent Act in 1987. Its stated mandate is “to protect and inform Canadians by ensuring that the 

prices of patented medicines sold in Canada are not excessive and by repor ting on pharmaceutical 

trends. ”121 The board does not set prices on its own, but it can refer what it considers excessive 

prices a patentee charges for strengths and forms of a patented medicine to an arbitral panel. Such 

a panel can order the price be reduc ed if it finds a particular patented medicine to be priced at an 

excessive level. The board ’s determinations are used to provide stakeholders with price, cost, and 

utilization information to help them to make pricing, purchasing, and reimbursement decision s. 122 

The proposed changes to its guidelines include the following :

 Pricing benchmarked against countries that PMPRB has deemed to be similar to 

Canada in terms of economic development and from the standpoint of consumer 

price protection .

 Maximum price consi deration to factor the overall value of a medicine using 

factors such as pharmacoeconomic analysis, market size, and affordability for 

both payers and patients based on national and per capita GDP. 123 

A third factor that would have based regulatory review on actual prices paid in Canada, taking 

into account confidential discounts and rebates provided to payers , was blocked by a Canadian 

federal court decision holding that PMPRB cannot mandate the reporting of third -party rebates. 124 

The international comparison uses 11 countries (Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, 

Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden , and the United Kingdom) .125 

USTR maintains these changes “would dramatically reshape how the Patented Medicine Prices 

Review Board evaluates patent ed pharmaceuticals and sets their ceiling prices. ” It maintains that 

the changes “would significantly undermine the marketplace for innovative pharmaceutical 

products, delay or prevent the introduction of new medicines in Canada, and reduce investments 

in Canada ’s life sciences sector. ”126 

Government Procurement 

The Biden Administration ’s commitment to domestic sourcing for U.S. government procurement 

may renew a periodic irritant in the U.S. -Canada bilateral economic relationship. On January 25, 

2021, President Biden issued an executive order that aims to increase the procurement of 

domestic goods and services. It would centralize the process by which waivers for government

purchas es of fo reign -made products are granted and subject waiver requests to additional 

scrutiny. It also would seek to make changes to implementing regulations for domestic sourcing 

laws, such as the Buy American Act of 1933 (41 U.S.C. 8301 et seq.) , by raising domestic content 

requirements and price preferences, and it would develop recommendations to expand domestic 

procurement policies to information technologies, among other provisions. 127 Canada reportedly 

will seek to negotiate exemptions to the proposed reg ulations. 128 

In general, the Buy American Act and various Buy American government procurement provisions 

in U.S. legislation restrict procurement co ntracts to the use of U.S. -made end p roducts and 

construction materials. U.S. regulation defines domestic end products and construction materials 

as unmanufactured end products or construction materials produce d in the United States or end 

products or construction materials in which the cost of the components mined, produced, or 

manufactured in the United States exceeds 55 % of the cost of all components (and more than 

95% for iron and steel products ).129 Buy America n provisions, which include transportation 

infrastructure funding, impose domestic content restrictions on federally funded grant projects 

contracted at the state or local level (so -called pass -through projects ). Although federally funded ,

these projects are not considered federal procurements. 

The Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.) permits some of these provisions to 

be waived for eligi ble or covered products and services from countries that 

 are parties to the WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA) ;

 have signed an FTA with t he United States that provides reciprocal competitive 

government procurement opportunities to U.S. products, services, and suppliers ;

or 

 benefit from U.S. unilateral trade preferences (e.g., Caribbean Basin 

countries). 130 

As a signatory to the GPA, Canada receives nondiscriminatory treatment for covered procurement 

in the United States on its products a nd services. The GPA is a plurilateral agreement that binds 

only those WTO members that agree to undertake obligations under it. Furthermore, the GPA 

applies only to the sectors and procurement that the national government and sub national (e.g., 

states or provinces) government agencies agree to include in their schedule of national 

commitments, as well as abo ve a certain monetary threshold. Canadian firms and suppliers are 

eligible to bid on procurements under the above provisions. However, Buy America n pro jects 

(described above) are not covered procurements under the agreement. 

NAFTA also contained a governm ent procurement chapter. In USMCA negotiations, Canada 

sought to expand reciprocal procurement opportunities in the U.S. market, whereas the Trump 

Admi nistration sought to restrict those opportunities or eliminate the chapter entirely. The final 

agreement retains a more limited government procurement chapter th an NAFTA with respect to 

Mexico but excludes U.S. -Canada procurement. In seeking to maintain go vernment procurement

opportunities in the United States, Canada has pointed to tightly integrated supply chains with 

Canadian finished products containing U.S. components and vice versa. 131 In the USMCA debate, 

some U.S. firms expressed concerns that procure ment opportunities under the GPA are not as 

extensive as those available to Canada ’s other FTA partners in Europe and Asia, giving those 

countries an advantage in Canadian procurement opportunities over U.S. firms. 132 

Steel and Aluminum Tariffs 

On March 8, 2018, President Trump signed proclamations imposing tariffs on steel (25%) and 

aluminum (10%) on several nations under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as 

amended, after the Commerce Department determined that current imports threaten nation al 

security. Canada and Mexico initially were excluded from the tariffs as an “incentive ” to a 

favorable conclusion of the NAFTA renegotiations. Both Canada and Mexico rejected the 

linkage, and tariffs were imposed on both countries on June 1, 2018. 133 Canad a maintained that, 

as a part of the U.S. defense industrial base and a NA TO ally, it should be excluded on national 

security grounds . Prime Minister Trudeau called the tariffs “an affront to the longstanding 

security partnership between Canada and the Unit ed States, and, in particular, to the thousands of 

Canadians who have fought and died alongside American comrades in arms. ”134 

On May 31, 2018, Canada announced retaliatory tariffs of $12.8 billion to begin on July 1, 2018. 

U.S. steel and steel products face d tariffs of 25%; U.S. aluminum and a host of other U.S. 

consumer products faced 10% tariffs. 135 The Canadian tariffs were targeted to extract maximum 

political cost. Canada brought a case challenging the duties under WT O dispute settlement, and it 

sought re course under NAFTA ’s state -to -state dispute settlement mechanism. 136 Canada 

subsequently dropped these cases. 

The signing of USMCA led to the withdrawal of all Section 232 steel and aluminum tariffs a nd 

related retaliatory tariffs i n May 2019. At the same ti me, the USMCA partners announced a new 

monitoring mechanism to prevent surges in imports of steel and aluminum. USMCA also 

contained a side letter, which would exempt 2.6 million vehicles and $108 billion of auto parts 

annually from the possible imposition of any Section 232 tariffs on motor vehicles. The Trump 

Administration reimposed a 10% ad valorem aluminum tariff by proclamation i n August 2020, 

after President Trump accused Canada of breaking a commitment to maintain stable levels of 

aluminum exports. 137 Following the release of the Canadian retaliation list targeting $2.7 billion 

in U.S. aluminum and aluminum products, USTR rescinded the aluminum tariffs maintaining that 

imports from Canada were “likely to normalize ” in the remainder of 2020. 138

# Energy 

Can ada is the United States ’ largest supplier of imported energy , including oil, uranium, natural 

gas, and electricity. In 2019, Canada wa s the world ’s fifth -largest petroleum producer ; the 

country ’s reserv es —largely in the form of bitumen oil reserves —are be lieved to be the third 

largest in the world , after those of Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. 139 In 20 20 , the value of U.S. 

petroleum and natural gas imports from Canada was $ 55.2 billion, falling from a peak of $ 112.4 

billion in 2014. 140 This figure largely represe nts the falling value of crude oil and natural gas, in 

part due to growing production in the United States from shale. Although the value of crude oil 

imports dropped, the volume of trade ha d continued to incre ase until 2020 (see  Table 3). In 20 20 ,

Canada provided 61.1 % of U.S. crude oil imports (up from 19.96 % in 20 10 )—about 1.3 billion 

barrels/day —and supplied 87.6 % of U.S. natural gas imports. 141 Canada is the largest supplier to 

the United States of processed uranium. Canada also is a net exporter of electricity to the United 

States through a heavily connected North American electricity grid. Canadian electricity is 

primarily renewable (60% hydro, 7% solar and wind) and , along with nuclear (15%), non -GHG -

emitting generation makes up 82% of supply. 142 Many analysts consider Canada to be a 

particularly valu able energy partner for the United States , because Canada provides a reliable 

supply ( it is not a member of OPEC ) and reduces U.S. dependence on the rest of the world .

# Keystone XL Pipeline 143 

Upon inauguration, President Biden revoked the required presidential permit for the cross -border 

construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, complicating the controversial pipeline ’s future. 144 The 

permit allowed for the construction of a 1.4 -mile stretch over the border, which has been 

completed, but also for its operation , which has yet to commence. The President ’s action is the 

latest roadblock for the pipeline. Originally, the Obama Administration denied a presidential 

permit in 2015. The Trump Administration revived the pipeline , issu ing new permits in 2017 and 

2019. Opponents of the pipeline, includi ng environmental, agricultural, and landowner interests,

challenged those permits in U.S. courts, further delaying construction. If completed, Keystone XL 

would be the main new pipeline to bring Canadian oil to the United States .

The Trudeau government ha s maintained a delicate balance on Keystone XL , continuing to 

support pipeline construction while pursuing other aspects of the government ’s climate strategy 

(see “Climate Change ,” below). Prime Minister Trudeau expressed muted criticism of the 

cancellation, stating, “While we welcome the President ’s commitment to fight climate change, we 

are disappointed but acknowledge the President ’s decision to fulfil his election campaign promise 

on Keystone XL. ”145 Leaders of the oil producing provinces criticized the move, with Alberta 

Premier Jason Kenney describing the action as a “gut punch ” to U.S. -Canada trade relations and 

calling on the Canadian federal governme nt to impose trade sanctions on the United States if the 

decision is not reconsidered. 146 The Alberta government was a stakeholder in the project, 

investing C$1.5 billion (approximately $1.2 billion) in the pipeline ’s provincial construction. 147 

TC Energy, the owner of the pipeline, announced it is suspending the project and laying off 1,000 

workers on both sides of the border, while assessing its future options. 148 The company could seek 

compensation under NAFTA ’s legacy ISDS provisions, seek redr ess in U.S. courts, or encourage 

the Canadian gove rnment to bring a case under USMCA ’s state -state dispute settlement chapter. 

# Trans -Mountain Pipeline 

The controversy over Keystone XL arguably has heightened the importance of the interprovincial 

Trans -Mou ntain Pipeline for the Canadian petroleum industry. However, the fate of that 

pipeline ’s expansion is unclear. In November 2016, Prime Minister Trudeau announced the 

approval of a project to expand the Trans -Mountain Pipeline through British Columbia to 

Vancouver, which may result in increased exports to China and other Asian markets. The project 

has been beset with delays and controversy from its inception. It has pitted the pipeline owners 

and oil sands producers seeking additional ways to export bitumen against environmentalists, 

climate activists, and some, but not all, First Nation bands (tribes). It also has produced acrimony 

between the provincial governments of Alberta, which wants the project to proceed, and British 

Columbia, which does not. 

On May 29, 2018, Canada ’s federal government announced it would buy the existing pipeline and 

the expansion project for C$4.5 billion (about $3.5 billion) from U.S. pipeline firm Kinder 

Morgan to complete the project as a Crown corporation. Later that year, the Federal Court of 

Appeal overturned the government ’s first approval of the  pipeline, citing insufficient consultation 

with certain First Nations bands and an improper assessment of its effect on marine life. A 

subsequent approval also was challenged by Firs t Nations bands, but the Supreme Court of 

Canada declined to review a Federal Court of Appeals ruling upholding the government ’s second 

approval in July 2020. 149

# Environmental and Transboundary Issues 

The United States and Canada have concluded a wide array of environmental and natural 

resources agreements at the federal, state/provincial, and local levels to manage transboundary 

issues . In recent years, some Members of Congress have examined the work of the Intern ational 

Joint Commission (IJC) , a binational organization created by the 1909 Boundary Waters Treaty to 

investigate and recommend solutions to transboundary water concerns, including those facing the 

Great Lakes (see “Great Lakes ”) . Others have tracked negotiations over potential modifications to 

the Columbia River Trea ty, which provides for the cooperative development and operation of the 

water resources of the Columbia River Basin in the northwestern United States and southwestern 

Canada (see CRS Report R43287, Columbia River Treaty Review ). President Biden and Prime 

Minister Trudeau have pledged to work together to combat climate change , which could include 

increased cooperation in the Arctic (see “Climate Change ” and “The Arctic ”). 

# Climate Change 

Canada and the United States have experienced similar debates over whether and how to address 

GHG -induced climate change. Both populations emit among the high est levels of GHG per 

person worldwi de due to a number of factors, including high income and consumption levels, 

dependence on personal vehicles and trucking , long travel distances, and cold winters (see  Table 

4). Further, national infrastructures were constructed in the context of inexpensive and generally 

abundant fossil fuels, which are responsible for the majority of GHG emissions. Both countries 

also have regions strongly dependent on producing and processing fossil fuels. Regulation of 

energy is primarily a provincial or state authority in both Canada and the United States. 

Environmental protection authorities ar e shared by the federal and sub -federal governments in 

both countries. Can ada typically has sought policies compatible with those of the United States 

with the understanding that there could be significant economic benefits in harmonizing aspects 

of GHG and other pollution control strategies to facilitate trade and make complian ce easier for 

transnational businesses.

Both nations also perceive certain vulnerabilities to climate change, including increasing forest 

and habitat losses and fires, public health effects of heat episodes and expanding disease vectors, 

increasing costs of cooling, and risks to coastal communiti es due to more intense storms and sea -Canada -U.S. Relations  

> Congressional Research Service 38

level rise. Shrinking sea -ice extent in the Arctic brings opportunities and concerns for both 

countries , due to the effects on indigenous populations and increased commercial activity, 

shipping, tourism, and risks of a ssociated accidents, as well as dramatically changing ecosystems 

(see “The Arctic ,” below) .

Paris Agreement Commitments 

The Paris Agreement (PA) is a subs idiary agreement to the 1992 United Nations Framework 

Convention on Climate Change . Both the United States and Canada became Parties to the Paris 

Agreement when it entered into force on November 4, 2016. The U.S. withdrawal from the PA 

became effective November 4, 2020, after President Trump, citing a campaign promise, 

announced his int ention to withdraw from the PA in June 2017. In 2017, Prime Minister Trudeau 

called President Trump ’s decision “disheartening, ” stating that “Canada stands united with all the 

other parties .” He also pledged that “Canada will continue to work with the Unit ed States at the 

state level, and with other U.S. stakeholders, to address climate change and promote clean 

growth. ”150 President Biden accepted the Paris Agreement upon his inauguration, making the 

United States again a Party as of February 19, 2021. Prime Minister Trudeau welcomed the 

decision. 151 

The negotiators intended the PA to be legally binding on its Parties, though not all provisions in it 

are mandatory. The PA requires Parties to communicate Nationally Determined Contributions 

(NDCs) identify ing how each Party intends to abate its GHG emissions, with a target and current 

time horizon of 2030 . Each government decides its own pledge. All PA emissions targets are 

voluntary and nonbinding, although the PA contains provisions to encourage their achievement .

Parties also should set goals to adapt to climate change and should cooperate toward the PA 

objectives, including mobilization of financial and other support. The financial commitments and 

others are hortatory or collective commitments to which it would be difficult to hold a n individual 

party accountable. 

The Canadian government submitted an updated NDC to the Paris Agreement in May 2017 .152 

Under it, Canada committed to reduce GHG emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030. 

Canada ’s commitment is economy -wide in scope, covering 100% of Canada ’s GHG inventory ; it 

includes carbon dioxide (CO ₂), methane (CH ₄), nitrous oxide (N ₂O), sulfur hexafluoride (SF ₆), 

perfluorocarbons (PFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), and nitrogen trifluoride (NF ₃) emissions 

from all s ectors covered by the internationally accepted guidelines of the Intergovernmental Panel 

on Climate Change. In June 2019, the House of Commons passed a motion declaring a climate 

emergency and reiterating its support for achieving climate goals. 153 

Canada ha s taken several steps to achieve these GHG -emission reductions. Since 2006, the 

Canadian government has established more stringent emissions standards for heavy -duty 

vehicles, passenger automobiles, and light trucks and instituted renewable fuels regulations that

require gasoline to contain an average of 5% renewable fuel content. It also has implemented 

electricity -sector regulations that ban the construction of traditional coal -fired generating units 

and will phase out existing coal -fired units t hat are unable to capture and store carbon. 154 

Climate Strategy 

The Canadian government ’s climate strategy has evolved since 2016. In December 2016, the 

government announced the Pan -Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change 

(PCF), a comprehensive strategy that addresses climate change and long -term economic 

growth. 155 The PCF provides guidance on issues such as carbon pricing, climate resilience, and 

green technology innovation. 

Under the plan, each province would design its own mechanism to price carbon emissions by 

2018, either through a fee on carbon dioxide -equivalent (CO 2e) emissions ,156 an emissions cap -

and -trade system, or a hybrid of the two approach es . The carbon price was to start at a minimum 

of C$10 (about $7.70) per metric ton in 2018 and rise to C$50 (about $38) per ton in 2022. 157 On 

December 11, 2020, the government announced the carbon price would rise C$15 per year (about 

$12) from 2023 to a total price of C$170 (about $131) in 2030 to meet its PA commitments. 158 

Initially, all provinces and territories except Saskatchewan agreed to devise their own carbon 

pricing system s, although Manitoba and New Brunswick did not follow through with their own 

plans. In addition, the Liberal government in Ontario and the NDP government in Alberta —which 

had implemented carbon cap -and -trade plans —were voted out of office, and their Conservative 

party successors abandoned the plans. 

Meanwhile, the Provinces of Ontario and Saskatchewan challenged the constitutionality of the 

PCF. Courts of Appeal in Ontario a nd Saskatchewan have upheld the PCF ’s constitutionality, 

maintaining the federal legislation was under Parliament ’s authority to address issues of “national 

concern. ”159 However, the Court of Appeal in Alberta declared the law unconstitutional. The 

Supreme C ourt of Canada heard appeals of these cases on September 22 -23, 2020, but has yet to 

render a judgement. 160 

For the provinces that did not adopt their own mechanisms, the federal government is imposing a 

backstop carbon price under the Greenhouse Gas Polluti on Pricing Act (GGPPA), which received 

royal assent on June 21, 2018. The GGPPA consists of two parts, a consumer fuel charge and an

output -based pricing system (OBPS) for industrial facilities. 161 The fuel charge applies to 21 

different types of fuel and co mbustible waste. The fuel charge affects not only consumer activities 

such as driving and home heating but also entities involved in the distribution, wholesale, or trade 

of those fuels. The fuel charge is applied to the provinces of Alberta, Manitoba, New Brunswick, 

Ontario, and Saskatchewan, as well as to the territories of Nunavut and the Y ukon. The revenue 

generated by carbon levy largely is returned to the provinces. 

The second prong of the GGPPA is the OBPS. In general, it is designed to maintain the incentives 

derived from carbon pricing but also to reduce the cost to firms in order to maintain 

competitiveness and avoid carbon leakage. 162 The system applies to industries for which a 

standard emission intensity (i.e., emissions per unit of output) has b een developed; these 

industries include “emission -intensive trade -exposed ” industries such as steel, smelting, pulp and 

paper, and cement, among others. OBPS applies to industrial facilities that emit 50 kilotonnes of 

CO 2e, with the option for voluntary pa rticipation for smaller firms. Under the plan, industries will 

pay the consumer fuel charge (C$40 in 2021) for emissions over a certain level but then may 

receive credits for 80% of the benchmark industry average GHG intensity. Thus, the policy is 

designed to maintain the price incentive for both low and high emitter s to achieve greater 

emissions efficiency. 

COVID -19 Climate Mitigation Activities 

In its response to the COVID -19 emergency, Canada has incorporated climate change mitigation 

efforts in its economic recovery plans . In its initial response to the crisis, the Trudeau government 

allocated C$750 million (about $577 million) to create an Emission Reduction Fund. The fund 

provides loans and grants to eligible firms in the oil and gas sector to redu ce their GHG emissions 

and to comply with the government ’s new methane regulations. 163 In addition, the government is 

requiring borrowers accessing its emergency COVID -19 lending facility —the Large Employer 

Emergency Financing Facility —to adhere to certain a ffirmative covenants , including “publishing 

an annual climate -related financial disclosure report, highlighting how corporate governance, 

strategies, policies and practices will help manage climate -related risks and opportunities; and 

contribute to achievi ng Canada ’s commitments under the Paris Agreement and goal of net zero by 

2050. ”164 

This requirement may be a precursor to requiring all companies to report on climate risks in their 

regulatory documents. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Com mission requires 

companies to disclose climate risk, which the Biden Administration may revise and may lead to 

discussions between the United States and Canada to harmonize such requirements. 165

Healthy Environment and Healthy Economy Plan 

On December 11, 20 20, Canada ’s federal government released its Healthy Environment and 

Healthy Economy Plan (HEHEP) to accelerate the country ’s response to climate change. 166 The 

plan ’s goal is to meet and exceed Canada ’s Paris Agreement commitments —now aiming for a 

32% -40% r eduction from 2005 levels by 2030 —and to achieve net -zero carbon emissions by 

2050. To achieve its goals, the government plans to spend C$15 billion (about $11.5 billion) on 

64 discrete proposals, some of which were announced in the Fall Economic Statement 2020 . The 

three major components of the plan are carbon pricing measures, infrastructure investments, and 

clean transportation initiatives. 

 Carbon Pricing. The government will implement a C$15 (about $12) /ton yearly 

rise in the carbon price from the curr ently envisioned C$50 ($38) /ton in the PCF 

in 2022 to C$170 (about $131)/ton in 2030. In conjunction with the 

announcement of HEHEP, the government published proposed regulations to 

implement a clean fuel standard (CFS). The CFS would require fossil fuel 

producers to lower the carbon intensity of their products throughout their life -

cycle, from drilling, transport, and refining to the composition of the fuel itself. 

The program dropped an early proposal to include gaseous fuels in the CFS. 

 Infrastructure In vestment. The government proposes to fund the construction 

of new green buildings, retrofit existing homes, and finance the retrofit of 

commercial and industrial buildings. It plans to establish a Net -Zero Accelerator 

Fund to scale up green technology in i ndustry and reduce emissions from energy -

intensive industries. It also proposes to allocate funds for renewable electricity 

and grid modernization projects. 

 Clean Transportation. The plan seeks to promote zero -emission vehicles 

(ZEVs) and low -emissions tra nsit by extending incentives for ZEV purchases ,

building charging and refueling infrastructure nationwide , providing a 100% tax 

write -off for commercial ZEVs , committing to match the most stringent 

emissions standards in North America by 2025 , and electrif ying public 

transportation systems. 

U.S. -Canada Cooperation to Reduce Greenhouse -Gas Emissions 

Although climate change cooperation at the federal level decreased under the Trump 

Administration, subnational cooperation among provinces, states, and localitie s continued. In 

2017, the states and provinces of the Conference of New England Governors and Eastern 

Canadian Premiers adopted a Regional Climate Action Plan ,167 an update of the 2001 Climate 

Change Action Plan —the world ’s first international, multi -governm ent effort to tackle climate 

change . The 2001 plan largely was achieved by 2010. The new plan aims to decrease GHG 

emissions by 35 %-45% below 1990 levels by 2030. The new regional target is meant to orient the

provinces and states in their long -term goal t o reach a 75 %-85% reduction of 2001 emission 

levels by 2050 .168 

California and Quebec link ed their GHG cap -and -trade programs under the 2013 Western Climate 

Initiative, to which Ontario also belonged until it withdrew in July 2018. Nova Scotia joined the 

ini tiative in 2018, although it maintains a separate cap -and -trade program from the other 

jurisdictions. In October 2019, the U.S. Justice Department sued California, seeking to nullify the 

arrangement, claiming the agreement is an unconstitutional intrusion into the federal 

government ’s powers over foreign affairs. 169 A federal judge ultimately dismissed the case in July 

2020. 170 Meanwhile, California and the Canadian federal government signed a memorandum of 

understanding on combating GHG emissions and air pollution through cooperation over cleaner 

vehicles, engines, and fuels, emissions standards, and the transition to clean transportation. 171 

President Biden and Prime Minister Trudeau have reiterated the importance of addressing climate 

change. They reported ly intend to work together to achieve net -zero GHG emissions, including 

through cross -border clean electricity transmission and advancements in the automotive sector. 172 

# The Arctic 

As two of the eight countries with territory north of the Arctic Circle, Cana da and the United 

States have substantial interests in the changing region. 173 Temperatures in the Arctic have 

warmed significantly since the 1970s, including an increase of 0.75ºC over the past decade 

compared with the 1951 -1980 mean. 174 The resulting decline in sea ice is gradually opening the 

region to increased shipping, tourism, and resource extraction, among other activities. Although 

these changes may provide commercial opportunities for Arctic countries and communities, they 

also present new challenges, ranging from environmental degradation to increased geopolitical 

competition. 175 

Canada and the United States have sought to work together to address shared challenges in the 

Arctic region. In 2012, the countries signed a Tri -Command Framework for Arctic Co operation 

intended to improve safety, security, and defense coordination among the three commands with 

Arctic responsibilities (CJOC, NORTHCOM, and NORAD). As part of ongoing efforts to 

modernize NORAD, Canada and the United States are considering options for replacing the aging 

North Warning System, which provides aerospace surveillance along the northern approaches to 

North America.

In addition to those defense efforts, the countries have coordinated on economic development and 

environmental conservation initiative s in the region. In 2016, for example, they jointly pledged to 

establish low -impact shipping corridors, manage Arctic fisheries sustainably, and limit offshore 

oil and gas leasing. 176 The Trump Administration sought to reopen portions of the Arcti c Ocean to 

oil and gas development but continued to engage with Canada on issues such as joint contingency 

planning for transboundary oil spills. 177 

Canada and the United States also have participated in multilateral efforts to address Arctic 

concerns. Both countries were founding members of the Arctic Council, which brings together the 

eight Arctic states, six organizations representing indigenous peoples, and various observers to 

promote cooperation on sustainable development and environmental protection. Under the 

auspices of the council, the Arctic states have negotiated three binding instruments: a 2011 

Agreement on Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic , a 

2013 Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedne ss and Response in the 

Arctic , and a 2017 Agreement on Enhancing International Ar ctic Scientific Cooperation. 178 

Canada and the United States also were leading participants in multilateral negotiations that 

resulted in a 2018 Agreement to Prevent Unregulated High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic 

Ocean .179 

Nevertheless, some Arctic issues remain contentious. In addition to an unresolved boundary 

dispute in the Beaufort Sea north of the Y ukon and Alaska, Canada and the United States have a 

long -standing disa greement regarding the sea routes commonly known as the Northwest Passage .

Canada argues the various channels that pass through Canada ’s 36,000 -island Arctic archipelago 

are internal waters subject to Canadian control . The United States, the European Union, and 

others maintain the Northwest P assage is an internation al strait through which foreign vessels 

have a right to transit. The dispute has been mostly dormant since 1988, when the United States 

pledged that all nav igation by U.S. icebreakers through the passage would be undertaken with the 

consent of the Canadian government and Canada agreed to facilitate such navigation. 180 In light 

of increasing Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic, some analysts argue it woul d be in the 

United States ’ national security interests to recognize Canada ’s sovereignty claim and help it 

exercise control over the Arctic approaches to North America. 181 Others are concerned, however, 

that doing so would create a precedent that could affec t U.S. navigation through other strategic 

waterways, such as the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. 

More recently, Canada and the United States have been at odds over oil and gas development in 

the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Congress est ablished an oil and gas program in the 

refuge as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( P.L. 115 -97 ), which President Trump signed into law

in December 2017. The act directs the Bureau of Land Management to conduct an initial lease 

sale within 4 years of enactment and a second lease sale within 10 years of enactment. 182 The 

House passed a bill ( H.R. 1146 , 11 6th Congress ) in September 2019 that would have repealed the 

oil and gas program ; the Senate did not act on it. The Trump Administration conducted an initial 

lease sale of 11 tracts on some 550,000 acres on January 6, 202 1.183 President Biden is opposed to 

development in the refuge, and placed a temporary moratorium on all federal government 

activities related to the implementation of the oil and gas program following his inauguration .184 

The Canadian government, the territorial governments of the Y ukon and Nor thwest Territories, 

and several indigenous peoples are opposed to the U.S. oil and gas program. They argue that such 

development in the refuge could negatively affect transboundary wildlife, such as the Porcupine 

caribou herd, as well as the culture and su bsistence of indigenous peoples who depend on it. 185 

Under a 1987 bilateral agreement, the United States and Canada have committed to conserve the 

Porcupine caribou herd and its habitat and to consult with one another regarding any activities 

that could have a “significant long -term adverse impact ” on the herd. 186 

# Great Lakes 

The Great Lakes contain 85% of North America ’s fresh water. They serve as the primary source 

of drinking water for more than 40 million people and support a wide range of economic 

activit ies, including farming, fishing, manufacturing, and tourism. 187 Decades of heavy 

manufacturing and other human activity have altered the lakes, however, leading to degraded 

water quality and diminished habitat for native species. 

Federal, state, provincial, local, and tribal governments in the United States and Canada have 

sought to work together to address those environmental challenges and restore the Great Lakes 

ecosystem. In 2012, the United States and Canada amended the Great Lakes Water Quality 

Agreemen t (GLWQA), a commitment originally signed in 1972 that provides a framework for 

identifying binational priorities and implementing actions that improve water quality. The revised 

agreement is intended to help the United States and Canada better anticipate and prevent 

ecological harm. It includes new provisions to address aquatic invasive species ; habitat 

degradation and the effects of climate change ; and continued threats to people ’s health and the 

environment , such as harmful algae, toxic chemicals, and discharges from vessels. 188

The United States and Canada both have provided funding to advance the goals of the GLWQA. 

In 2016, Congress authorized appropriations of $300 million annually from FY2017 to FY2021 

for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative under Title IV of the Water Infrastructure Improvements 

for the Nation Act ( P.L. 114 -322 ). 189 Although t he Trump Administration sought to eliminate the 

initiative in FY2018 and proposed deep cuts in FY2019 and FY2020, Congress continued to 

support restoration efforts. Annual appropriations amounted to $300 million in FY2018, $300 

million in FY2019, and $320 million in FY2020. The Consoli dated Appropriations Act, 2021 

(P.L. 116 -260 ), increased funding for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative to $330 million, 

which is $15 million more than the Trump Admini stration requested. In 2017, the Canadian 

government allocated C$44.8 million (approximately $34 million) over five years for its Great 

Lakes Protection Initiative, placing a particular focus on efforts to reduc e toxic and nuisance 

algae and strengthen the resilience of Great Lakes coastal wetlands. 190 The government of 

Ontario, which borders four of the Great Lakes, committed an additional C$7.5 million 

(approximately $5.8 million) to protection and restoration efforts in 2020. 191 

The IJC issued the First Trie nnial Assessment of Progress on Great Lakes Water Quality in 2017. 

The report found the United States and Canada had made progress toward meeting many of the 

GLWQA ’s objectives, including accelerated restoration of contaminated areas of concern ; the 

develo pment of binational habitat conservation strategies ; the absence of newly introduced 

aquatic invasive species, such as Asian carp ; and comprehensive reporting on groundwater 

science. It also identified significant challenges, such as an increase in harmful algal blooms, the 

slow pace in addressing chemicals of mutual concern, the spread of previously introduced 

invasive species, and insufficient investments in infrastructure to prevent the discharge of 

untreated or insufficiently treated waste into the Great Lakes. 192 A follow -up report, issued in 

December 2020, reiterated the 2017 findings and recommended the countries cooperate with t he 

IJC to develop an improved assessment framework, collaborate to eliminate harmful algal blooms 

in Lake Superior, and engage in broader and more meaningful public engagement. 193 

In June 2020, the U.S. E nvironmental Protection Agency and Environment and Cl imate Change 

Canada released a joint report on the status of the Great Lakes ecosystem that echoed many of the 

IJC ’s findings. Taking into account nine overarching indicators of ecosystem health and 45 

science -based sub -indicators, the report assessed the Great Lakes to be in “fair ” condition , with 

trends neither improving nor deteriorating. Ecosystem health differed by lake, however, with 

Lake Superior assessed to be in “good ” condition and Lake Erie assessed to be in “poor ”

condition; Lake Michigan, Lake Huron, and Lake Ontario each were assessed to be in “fair ”

condition. 194 

Some Members of Congress expressed concerns about a proposed deep geologic repository for 

nuclear waste by the Bruce nuclear power facility in Kincardine, Ontario. The proposed site, 

lo cated about 1 kilometer inland from Lake Huron, would hold low - to mid -level waste materials

Ojibway Nation voted against the repository ’s construction, effectively scu ttling the project .

# Outlook 

U.S. -Canad a relations were somewhat strained from 2017 to 2020 , as the Trump Administration 

called into question many long -standing pillars of the bilateral relationship. Nevertheless, the 

United States and Canada continued to cooperate on a wide array of issues, reflecting the 

countries ’ extensive ties and close working relationships between U.S. and Canadian institutions 

at all levels of government. President Biden and Pr ime Minister Trudeau have committed to 

reinvigorating bilateral cooperation to bolster economic and defense ties and to address shared 

challenges, such as climate change and the COVID -19 pandemic. 195 Some issues, such as defense 

spending, cross -border oil pi pelines, and certain trade policies are likely to remain contentious, 

however, and efforts to forge closer ties may have to overcome lingering Canadian doubts 

regarding the long -term reliability of the United States.
