# The Louisiana Purchase 

> December 1991

The story of the way in which the United States 

acquired Louisiana is complicated, involving 

power politics, intrigue and suspicion. It also 

reveals the foresight of Thomas Jefferson, who 

considered the purchase one of his greatest 

achievements. 

At the end of the French and Indian Wars in 

1763, France lost all of its possessions in North 

America, dashing hopes of a colonial empire. This 

empire was centered on the Caribbean island 

of Santo Domingo and its lucrative cash crop 

of sugar. The French territory called Louisiana, 

extending from New Orleans up the Missouri 

River to modern-day Montana, was intended as a 

granary for this empire and produced flour, salt, 

lumber, and food for the sugar islands. By the 

terms of the 1763 Treaty of Fontainbleau, however, 

Louisiana west of the Mississippi was ceded to 

Spain, while the victorious British received the 

eastern portion of the huge colony. 

When the United States won its independence 

from Great Britain in 1783, one of its major 

concerns was having a European power on its 

western boundary, and the need for unrestricted 

access to the Mississippi River. As American 

settlers pushed west, they found that the 

Appalachian Mountains provided a barrier to 

shipping goods eastward. The easiest way to ship 

produce was to build a flatboat and float down 

the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers to the port of 

New Orleans, from which goods could be put on 

ocean-going vessels. The problem with this route 

was that the Spanish owned both sides of the 

Mississippi below Natchez. 

In 1795 the United States negotiated the Pinckney 

Treaty with Spain, which provided the right of 

navigation on the river and the right of deposit 

of U.S. goods at the port of New Orleans. The 

treaty was to remain in effect for three years, 

with the possibility of renewal. By 1802, U.S. 

farmers, businessmen, trappers and lumbermen 

were bringing over $1 million worth of produce 

through New Orleans each year. Spanish officials 

were becoming concerned, as U.S. settlement 

moved closer to their territory. Spain was eager 

to divest itself of Louisiana, which was a drain 

on its financial resources. On October 1, 1800, 

Napoleon Bonaparte, First Consul of France, 

concluded the Treaty of San Ildefonso with Spain, 

which returned Louisiana to French ownership in 

exchange for a Spanish kingdom in Italy. 

Napoleon’s ambitions in Louisiana involved 

the creation of a new empire centered on the 

Caribbean sugar trade. By terms of the Treaty of 

Ameins of 1800, Great Britain returned ownership 

of the islands of Martinique and Guadaloupe to 

the French. Napoleon looked upon Louisiana as 

a depot for these sugar islands, and as a buffer to 

U.S. settlement. In October of 1801 he sent a large 

military force to retake the important island of 

Santo Domingo, lost in a slave revolt in the 1790s. 

Thomas Jefferson, third President of the United 

States, was disturbed by Napoleon’s plans to re-

establish French colonies in America. With the 

possession of New Orleans, Napoleon could close the Mississippi to U.S. commerce at any time. 

Jefferson authorized Robert R. Livingston, U.S. 

Minister to France, to negotiate for the purchase 

for up to $2 million of the City of New Orleans, 

portions of the east bank of the Mississippi, and 

free navigation of the river for U.S. commerce. 

An official transfer of Louisiana to French 

ownership had not yet taken place, and 

Napoleon’s deal with the Spanish was a poorly 

kept secret on the frontier. On October 18, 1802, 

however, a strange thing happened. Juan Ventura 

Moralis, Acting Intendant of Louisiana, made 

public the intention of Spain to revoke the right 

of deposit at New Orleans for all cargo from the 

United States. The closure of this vital port to the 

United States caused anger and consternation, 

and commerce in the west was virtually 

blockaded. Historians believe that the revocation 

of the right of deposit was prompted by abuses of 

the Americans, particularly smuggling, and not 

by French intrigues as was believed at the time. 

President Jefferson ignored public pressure for 

war with France, and appointed James Monroe 

special envoy to Napoleon, to assist in obtaining 

New Orleans for the United States. Jefferson 

boosted the authorized expenditure of funds to 

$10 million. 

Meanwhile, Napoleon’s plans in the Caribbean 

were being frustrated by Toussaint L’Ouverture, 

his army of former slaves, and yellow fever. 

During ten months of fierce fighting on Santo 

Domingo, France lost over 40,000 soldiers. 

Without Santo Domingo Napoleon’s colonial 

ambitions for a French empire were foiled in 

North America. Louisiana would be useless as a 

granary without sugar islanders to feed. Napoleon 

also considered the temper of the United States, 

where sentiment was growing against France 

and stronger ties with Great Britain were being 

considered. Spain’s refusal to sell Florida was the 

last straw, and Napoleon turned his attention 

once more to Europe; the sale of the now-useless 

Louisiana would supply needed funds to wage 

war there. Napoleon directed his ministers, 

Talleyrand and Barbe-Marbois, to offer the entire 

Louisiana territory to the United States - and 

quickly. 

On April 11, 1803, Talleyrand asked Robert 

Livingston how much the United States was 

prepared to pay for Louisiana. Livingston was 

confused, as his instructions only covered the 

purchase of New Orleans and the immediate 

area, not the entire Louisiana territory. James 

Monroe agreed with Livingston that Napoleon 

might withdraw this offer at any time. To wait 

for approval from President Jefferson might take 

months, so Livingston and Monroe decided 

to open negotiations immediately. By April 30, 

they closed a deal for the purchase of the entire 

828,000 square mile Louisiana territory for 60 

million Francs (approximately $15 million). Part of 

this sum was used to forgive debts owed by France 

to the United States. The payment was made in 

United States bonds, which Napoleon sold at face 

value to the Dutch firm of Hope and Company, 

and the British banking house of Baring, at a 

discount of 87 1/2 per each $100 unit. As a result, 

Napoleon received only $8,831,250 in cash for 

Louisiana. Dutiful banker Alexander Baring 

conferred with Marbois in Paris, shuttled to the 

United States to pick up the bonds, took them to 

Britain, and returned to France with the money 

- and Napoleon used these funds to wage war 

against Baring’s own country! 

When news of the purchase reached the United 

States, President Jefferson was surprised. He 

had authorized the expenditure of $10 million 

for a port city, and instead received treaties 

committing the government to spend $15 million 

on a land package which would double the size 

of the country. Jefferson’s political opponents 

in the Federalist Party argued that the Louisiana 

purchase was a worthless desert, and that the 

Constitution did not provide for the acquisition 

of new land or negotiating treaties without the 

consent of the Senate. What really worried 

the opposition were the new states which 

would inevitably be carved from the Louisiana 

territory, strengthening Western and Southern 

interests in Congress, and further reducing the 

influence of New England Federalists in national 

affairs. President Jefferson was an enthusiastic 

supporter of westward expansion, and held firm 

in his support for the treaty. Despite Federalist 

objections, the U.S. Senate ratified the Louisiana 

treaty in the autumn of 1803. A transfer ceremony was held in New Orleans on 

November 29, 1803. Since the Louisiana territory 

had never officially been turned over to the 

French, the Spanish took down their flag, and the 

French raised theirs. The following day, General 

James Wilkinson accepted possession of New 

Orleans for the United States. A similar ceremony 

was held in St. Louis on March 9, 1804, when a 

French tricolor was raised near the river, replacing 

the Spanish national flag. The following day, 

Captain Amos Stoddard of the First U.S. Artillery 

marched his troops into town and ran the stars 

and stripes up the fort’s flagpole. The Louisiana 

territory was officially transferred to the United 

States government, represented by Meriwether 

Lewis. 

The Louisiana Territory, purchased for less than 

5 cents an acre, was one of Thomas Jefferson’s 

greatest contributions to his country. Louisiana 

doubled the size of the United States literally 

overnight, without a war or the loss of a single 

American life, and set a precedent for the 

purchase of territory. It opened the way for the 

eventual expansion of the United States across the 

continent to the Pacific, and its consequent rise 

to the status of world power. International affairs 

in the Caribbean and Napoleon’s hunger for cash 

to support his war efforts were the background 

for a glorious achievement of Thomas Jefferson’s 

presidency, new lands and new opportunities for 

the nation.
