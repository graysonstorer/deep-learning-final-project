This year’s Charities Aid Foundation World Giving Index provides insights into the global giving landscape as we emerged from the initial stages of the pandemic and began to live with Covid-19 in 2021. This report shows the impact that the health crisis and other social and geopolitical pressures have had on human behaviour worldwide. 

Giving  takes  different  forms  around  the  globe,  and  even  the 

definitions  of  what  constitutes  charity  and  generosity  differ 

across cultures. Our World Giving Index aims to measure generosity with three cross-cultural human behaviours. Encouragingly, the overall Index score has increased, indicating that people around the world have been engaging more in the actions measured than during the previous year. In whatever form it may take, the desire to help others has grown in most instances, despite fewer opportunities during some stages of the pandemic. There was an especially marked increase in people who said they had helped a stranger with approximately half a billion more people reporting that they had helped someone they didn’t know. The concern and care for neighbours that so many of us witnessed during the pandemic appears to have transcended borders, as shown by the high scores for helping strangers in Central and South American countries. As these regions faced uncertain political situations and high levels of migration, personal responsibility to help others came to the fore. This community spirit has since been echoed in Europe’s response to the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine – a country which came out 10th in our Index, showing the strength of civil society in Ukraine before the invasion. 

Covid-19  has  affected  the  world’s  poorest  and  vulnerable 

the most, disrupting progress towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Private donors and businesses are 

likely  to  be  called  upon  to  fill  funding  gaps  and  charities  will 

need to work out how best to direct their limited funding for the greatest impact. However, in the wake of two 

difficult  years  and  with  further  challenges  likely  to  come,  we 

continue to observe great instances of global generosity. 

The world is facing an increasingly unstable geopolitical environment: there are fears of a global recession and 

climate  change  is  affecting  food  supply,  migration  and 

natural disasters. Against this uncertain backdrop, we hope the insights captured in this edition of the World Giving Index improve understanding about global giving, and encourage conversations on how the work of individuals, charities, businesses, and governments can help to build stronger and more sustainable societies. One of the privileges of working for the Charities Aid Foundation is having the opportunity to see how generosity contributes to stronger charities, communities, and societies. We aim to build towards a fair and sustainable future for all – which is why we take pride in helping individuals as well as businesses give anywhere safely to support those in need.

Chief Executive, Charities Aid Foundation Background 

CAF has been producing its World Giving Index for more 

than  a decade.  The  first  CAF  World  Giving  Index  was 

published  in  the  wake  of  the  global  financial  crisis,  offering 

insights into generosity in times of tumult. Now this long-running study has given us the opportunity to look not only at how the Covid-19 pandemic has impacted giving around the world, but also how the global community is engaging with giving as we seek to establish a new sense of normalcy. This report provides insight into the scope and nature of giving around the world by examining three aspects of giving behaviour. The questions at the heart of the report are: Have you done any of the following in the past month? • Helped a stranger, or someone you didn’t know who needed help? • Donated money to a charity? • Volunteered your time to an organisation? 

The report includes the results of 1.95 million individuals interviewed across the globe since 2009. The result is one of the biggest surveys into giving ever produced. 

All  fieldwork  has  been  conducted  by  the  market  research 

firm,  Gallup 1, as part of its World Poll initiative 2 . The 

findings  in  this  report  are  based  on  the  published  World  Poll 

dataset as of 31st March 2022. 1 Gallup website: www.gallup.com/home.aspx

CAF World Giving Index 2022 – about the data 

For this edition, data has been included for 119 countries, representing more than 90% of the global adult population. 

CAF World Giving Index ranking and scores 

In order to establish a rounded measure of giving behaviour across the world, the CAF World Giving Index relies on a simple averaging of the responses from the three key questions asked in each country. Each country is given a percentage score and countries are ranked based on these scores. In 2019, CAF published a ten-year anniversary issue 

of  the  Index  which  aggregated  the  survey’s  findings  over  the 

course of a decade. 

About us

governments,  charities  and  not-for-profit  enterprises.  Our 

independence, expertise and international reach enable hundreds of millions of pounds each year to move across sectors and borders and arrive safely with thousands of charities to make a greater impact. www.cafonline.org 

# About this report Charities Aid Foundation | World Giving Index 2022 

4The  CAF  World  Giving  Index  offers  a unique  insight  into 

global trends in generosity. It enables us to understand where people are most likely to engage in social activities 

for  the  benefit  of  their  communities  and  to  champion  the 

growth of global giving. Giving is changing, not least on an individual level as people around the world emerge from pandemic restrictions with new considerations and challenges. However, the existence of generosity and civil society worldwide is a constant. What the World Giving Index shows is that the act of giving exists in all societies. This reality makes the value of CAF’s work and the charities it supports even more apparent. A key priority for CAF is highlighting the value of cross-border giving: we 

enable  donors  to  give  safely  and  effectively  across 

borders  to  charities.  In  the  last  financial  year,  CAF  helped 

deliver almost £1bn to over 100,000 charities in 110 

countries  and  around  a fifth  of  those  donations  moved 

across  borders,  originating  from  our  offices  in  the  UK,  the 

United States and Canada. CAF has consistently called for governments, policy makers and international funders to ensure the building blocks are in place to enable cross-border giving and local giving structures to build sustainability. To arrive there; Governments need to: • make sure that civil society organisations are regulated in a fair, consistent and open way 

# • make it easy for people to give  and  offer  incentives 

for giving where possible • promote civil society as an independent voice in public life and respect the right  of  not-for-profit 

organisations to speak out on important issues International funders need to: • provide funding for organisations which provide support to donors and civil society organisations to build infrastructure that can continue to generate funds for civil society even after aid ends • fund local organisations directly to improve the 

accountability  and  efficiency  of  aid 

# • recognise the importance of helping grantees to build sustainable domestic support and fund accordingly Civil Society organisations need to: • ensure good governance and be transparent about impact to build public trust • meaningfully engage local communities in decision-making so civil society becomes locally owned • recognise and build on traditional forms of giving to create organisations and a culture of giving which works to the strengths of the local context

5Key findings 

INDONESIA IS THE MOST GENEROUS COUNTRY IN THE WORLD FOR THE FIFTH YEAR IN A ROW 

Indonesia tops the World Giving Index for a 

fifth  year  with  a score  of  68%.  The  country 

has the highest rates of donating and volunteering in the world. During 2021, more than eight in ten people donated money and more than six in ten (63%) volunteered time. 

MORE THAN THREE BILLION PEOPLE HELPED SOMEONE THEY DIDN’T KNOW IN 2021 

More people than ever (62%) reported that they helped a stranger last year, which is the highest score recorded since 2009. The need created by the pandemic, and the subsequent feelings of community and solidarity, were likely behind this upward trend. Except for the United States, the countries in the top 10 for helping a stranger are all located in Africa and South and Central America. 

MORE PEOPLE THAN EVER DONATED MONEY IN 2021 

Despite a global pandemic and the economic hardship experienced by many communities worldwide, people continued to donate money to charity. In high-income economies, the rate of donations sharply increased by 10%. With the exception of Indonesia and Myanmar -which have strong traditions of religious giving – high-income countries made up the top 10 for this measure. 

PARTICIPATION AND GIVING IN HIGH-INCOME COUNTRIES HAVE BOUNCED BACK TO HISTORIC LEVELS 

Many high-income countries saw a steep 

decline  in  scores  in  2018  which  continued  and 

even  accelerated  during  the  first  year  of  the 

pandemic. But during 2021, this trend was largely reversed with some of those countries now returning to the top 10, albeit some with lower Index scores. However, low-and-middle-income countries tended to see increased 

scores  during  the  first  year  of  the  pandemic, 

with further rises in 2021, most notably for volunteering and helping a stranger. Charities Aid Foundation | World Giving Index 2022 

61.0 | The CAF World Giving Index 

# 1.1  Overview The pandemic and its economic impact do not seem to have dampened our enthusiasm for giving. On the contrary, the 

global  World  Giving  Index  score  for  2021  now  stands  at  40%,  having  recorded  its  largest  ever  annual  increase  of  five 

percentage points. Participation and giving levels increased substantially for each of the three measures included in the 

Index.  The  global  increase  is  most  marked  amongst  high-income  countries,  many  of  which  first  recorded  a decline  in  2018 

that was sustained until 2021. 

Figure 1: Global scores over time 

Helping  a stranger  reached  its  highest  recorded  level  in  2021,  with  three  out  of  five  (62%)  adults  helping  someone  they 

didn’t know, up from 55% in 2020. This equates to 3.5 billion people 3 , compared to almost three billion in 2020, and represents the highest ever global score across any of the three measures recorded in the CAF World Giving Index. In particular, low- and middle-income countries from Central and South America increased their scores for helping a stranger, 

with  five  of  these  countries  featuring  in  the  top  10  for  this  measure. 

Similarly, more people than ever reported donating to charity in 2021, rising to more than one in three (35%) individuals around the world. There was also an increase in volunteering to almost one in four people globally (23%), up from one in 

five  in  2020  (19%).

# 1.2  The world’s 10 most generous countries 

Figure 2: Highest scoring 10 countries in 2021 

Indonesia  has  the  highest  World  Giving  Index  score  for  the  fifth  year  in  a row.  The  country  maintains  its  top  ranking  with  an 

Index  of  68%,  largely  unchanged  since  2020  (69%).  Indonesia  has  the  highest  rate  of  donating  (84%)  and  volunteering  (63%) 

in the world. 

Kenya  follows  with  an  Index  score  of  61%,  up  from  58%  in  2020.  All  three  of  Kenya’s  scores  increased  in  2021.  The  country 

has a much higher than average score for helping a stranger – 77% of Kenyans helped someone they didn’t know in 2021, compared to the global average of 62%. 

Over  the  past  five  years,  Indonesia  and  Kenya  have  seen  increased  levels  of  participation  and  giving.  Since  religion  has 

traditionally  been  a key  driver  for  giving,  a possible  explanation  for  these  findings  could  be  their  large  religious  populations. 

These results could also be driven by community-focused cultural traditions such as Indonesia’s gotong-royong and Kenya’s 

harambee , which unite people in times of increased need, including during the Covid-19 pandemic.

“Indonesia’s philanthropic culture of collective actions – or, as we call it, gotong royong – has always been evident within Indonesia, and it is a pleasure to see it being recognised for its strengths and sparking interest abroad as well. 

Religious  giving  strongly  influences  Indonesia’s  giving  culture,  with  zakat  driving  the 

philanthropic  work  of  many.  Zakat  defines  giving  to  the  vulnerable  and  needy  as  a

religious duty for all Muslims who meet the necessary wealth criteria. This practice also applies to other religions in Indonesia. Indonesia is the world’s most populous 

Muslim-majority  country  and  is  home  to  231  million  Muslims. 

The  younger  generations  in  Indonesia  also  have  significant  interest  and  support  for 

charity and philanthropy activities. Young people are driving uptake of digital giving platforms, which help donation processes operate more quickly, safely, and easily. The growing private wealth of many Indonesians has likely also contributed to an 

observable  increase  in  philanthropic  activity  across  the  country  – not  just  in  the 

capital city but also at the regional level from east to west. Indonesia’s philanthropic eco-system is also growing increasingly sophisticated and diverse with collaboration and collective action as its heart.”

“Kenyans’  high  levels  of  solidarity  and  giving,  despite  the  difficulties  experienced  over 

the past year due to the COVID-19 pandemic and rising cost of living, is truly 

encouraging.  The  underpinnings  of  our  culture  and  religious  influence  continue  to 

contribute to actions around giving and therefore it is important for us to strengthen these positive values. My hope is that our giving and solidarity will permeate to 

non-traditional  areas  such  as  social  justice.  It  is  also  critical  that  more  avenues  are 

opened to support Kenyans who give and make it easier for Kenyans to give in an organised manner that ensures transparency and accountability.”

# Australia 

Canada  has  returned  to  the  top  10,  recording  a very  large  jump  from  rank  #35  in  2020  to  #8,  and  an  Index  score  of  51%,  up 

from  38%  in  2020.  After  a year  when  Western  countries  that  usually  occupied  the  top  rankings  were  adversely  influenced 

by  the  effects  of  the  pandemic,  in  2021  their  scores  returned  to  pre-pandemic  levels.  However,  some  of  these  Western 

top-ranking countries (such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, the Netherlands) did not place in the top 10 most generous countries in the world, due in large part to the unusually increased levels of giving in previously lower ranking countries. Two new countries entered the top 10 most generous countries in the world: Zambia and Ukraine. In fact, Ukraine is the only European country occupying a place in the top 10, moving up the rankings from #20 in 2020 to #10 in 2021. Ukraine’s increase across all three individual measures may be due in part to the country’s socio-economic growth and the cultural shifts that were taking place in the years before the war. Research on Ukrainians’ perception of charitable giving suggests that factors such as rising living standards, the implementation of new and more creative modes of charitable activities, and the increased need for giving due to the Covid-19 pandemic triggered this growth in giving and participation 4 .

As  first  noticed  in  last  year’s  report,  the  pandemic  has  been  changing  the  landscape  of  global  giving  behaviour.  In  2018, 

seven out of the 10 most generous countries were classed by the United Nations as high-income countries. However, in 2020, during the height of the pandemic, seven out of the top 10 were low- and middle-income economies. This trend continued in 2021. Only four of this year’s top 10 most generous countries are classed by the United Nations as high-income countries, and six are low- and middle-income countries.

“It is great to see Australia in the top 5 most generous countries again this year. As lockdown restrictions eased and more in-person events began to take place, Australians found themselves with more opportunities to participate in civil society, which may have contributed to the increased numbers of Australians helping strangers or donating money. Many Australians also have a great deal of pride in our national cultural value of mateship, which embodies loyalty and friendship particularly in times of need. This cultural value and desire to create a fair society may well underpin Australians’ ongoing desire to give. From here, we would love to see even more of this generosity funnelled through 

workplace  giving  as  this  is  one  of,  if  not  the  most  efficient  way  to  maximise  the 

impact  this  spirit  has  on  making  a difference.  If  we  can  rapidly  get  the  most 

significant  amount  of  the  money  committed  to  where  it  is  being  used,  we  can  best 

help those in need and support the many causes about which Australians evidently feel so passionate.”

followed by Japan with an Index score of 20%, up from 12% in the previous year. Lebanon, Egypt and Afghanistan make up 

the  rest  of  the  five  lowest  scoring  countries  in  2021.  The  reasons  for  Japan’s  very  low  score  are  likely  to  be  cultural  in  nature 

– what might be perceived as charity in the United States is likelier to be understood as responsibility in Japan. Meanwhile, Afghanistan, Egypt and Lebanon are experiencing widespread poverty or famine, civil unrest or war, and political instability. Charities Aid Foundation | World Giving Index 2022 

11 2.1  Comparisons by income level Since early 2020, the world has experienced multiple waves of the Covid-19 pandemic, and most countries continued to 

employ  lockdown  strategies  during  2021.  In  January  2021,  high-income  countries  started  to  receive  the  first  shipments  of 

Covid-19 vaccines and lockdowns began to ease, whilst many low- and middle-income countries continued to face pandemic restrictions for a second year in a row.

Figure 4: High income countries: Global scores overtime 

The gradual easing of lockdown policies throughout 2021 led to increased mobility 5 and more opportunities to participate in charitable activities. As Figure 4 shows, there was a substantial increase across high-income countries in two giving behaviours. More people than ever (56%) reported that they helped someone they did not know, an increase of 12 

percentage  points  since  2020.  Similarly,  the  proportion  of  people  who  donated  increased  significantly  by  10  percentage 

points, from 35% in 2020 to 45% in 2021. 5 https://www.piie.com/blogs/realtime-economic-issues-watch/why-has-covid-19-lockdown-compliance-varied-between-high-and

12 2 GLOBAL SCORES OVER TIME 

The  global  rate  of  volunteering  saw  a smaller  but  significant  increase  to  21%,  from  17%  in  2020  when  lockdowns  likely 

limited  these  opportunities.  During  the  first  year  of  the  pandemic,  volunteering  rates  were  particularly  low  – but  rates  have 

been  low  since  as  far  back  as  2018.  The  improvement  shown  in  the  latest  results  represents  a return  to  the  higher  levels  of 

volunteering that were typical in the early and mid-2010s.

Figure 5: High income countries: Global scores overtime 

Like most high-income countries, many low- and middle-income economies (LMICs) employed lockdown restrictions in 

response  to  the  pandemic.  However,  the  difficulties  to  obtain  vaccines  meant  these  countries  tended  to  impose  much 

longer lockdowns, with social and economic problems more likely as a result 6 . Whilst there is some improvement in the LMICs scores in both helping a stranger and volunteering time, donating money has remained in line with the highest rate 

which  was  first  recorded  in  2020. 

Two  out  of  three  (65%)  adults  reported  helping  a stranger  in  LMICs,  up  from  61%  in  2020.  This  score  is  significantly  higher 

than in high-income countries, indicating increased need, and perhaps solidarity as the pandemic continued. Volunteering in LMICs also increased slightly from 20% to 24%. The increase in the overall global Index score is likely driven by a combination of high-income countries returning to 

pre-2018  giving  norms,  coupled  with  a more  gradual  improvement  in  scores  for  the  low- and  middle-income  countries.

This section outlines which countries have seen the largest increases or 

decreases  in  their  World  Giving  Index  score  over  the  past  five  years. 

Countries which have reported a score for at least four out of the last 

five  years  are  included  in  the  analysis  (2017  to  2021),  and  they  are 

ranked from the largest score increase to the largest score decrease over that time. 

The  country  with  the  largest  rise  in  Index  score  is  the  Czech  Republic, 

up 29 percentage points compared to 2017. As well as substantially 

improving  its  score,  the  Czech  Republic  has  moved  up  75  places  in  the 

ranking  compared  to  2020,  and  115  places  compared  to  2017.  Czechs 

became increasingly generous in 2021 with many more people donating money compared to 2020 (55% in 2021, 25% in 2020). A possible explanation for this sharp rise in charitable giving is the 

solid  growth  of  the  Czech  economy  during  2021.  This  recovery  was 

positively  reflected  in  the  labour  market,  with  low  unemployment 

rates – the lowest in the EU – and wage increases 7. Czechs  also  turned 

to new ways of donating. Public polling showed that increased 

numbers  of  Czechs  donated  money  online  and  through  text 

messages in 2021 compared to in 2020 8.

China  and  Serbia  reported  the  second  (28%)  and  third  (28%)  largest 

increases. Since 2016, when China introduced legislation to regulate Chinese charities, the country’s overall Index score and ranking have 

improved  significantly.  In  2017,  China  had  an  Index  score  of  14%,  and 

was  ranked  #138.  In  2021,  the  country  moved  up  to  #49  with  a score 

of 42%. Serbia has also seen a notable leap, moving up the ranking from #132 

with  a score  of  18%  in  2017,  to  #27  in  2021  and  a score  of  46%.  This 

remarkable increase may be partly due to systematic attempts to revive the practice of charitable giving in Serbia over the last decade 9.Notably, donation volumes nearly trebled during the pandemic 10 .

14 3 RISERS AND FALLERS 

# Serbia 

The Serbian Philanthropy Forum 11 , an umbrella organisation of foundations and donors in Serbia, reports that this growth is due in large part to Serbians increasing their donations via SMS to causes relating to healthcare and medical research, as 

well  as  natural  disasters  (e.g.  in  response  to  the  recent  earthquakes  in  Croatia).  Serbia’s  economic  recovery  after  the  first 

year  of  the  pandemic,  alongside  significant  wage  growth,  also  likely  contributed  to  the  high  rates  of  giving  and  participation. 

Other  countries  which  saw  an  improvement  are  Russia,  Paraguay,  Bulgaria,  Venezuela,  Poland,  Lithuania  and  Vietnam. 

At the other end of the spectrum, the country recording the biggest decline was Myanmar, down by 13 percentage points. Although Myanmar still ranks #6 on the overall Index in 2021, the country had previously placed #1 from 2014 to 2017. Over 

the  past  five  years,  there  have  been  shifts  in  the  country’s  scores  and  rankings,  but  it  has  remained  in  the  top  10,  despite 

significant  political  unrest. 

Half of the countries which declined the most in 2021 are high-income countries, such as Hong Kong, the Netherlands, 

Japan,  Ireland  and  Germany.  Notably,  Ireland  first  saw  a decline  in  2019.  Due  to  its  strong  charitable  tradition,  Ireland 

usually  features  in  the  most  generous  countries,  but  it  now  sits  just  outside  the  top  10  at  #11.

“Citizens  and  companies  in  Serbia  have  proven  that  they  possess  a high  degree  of 

responsibility towards the public interest and humanity in relation to individual needs of solidarity. Serbia’s rankings in this year’s World Giving Index capture this sense of responsibility that Serbians feel towards one another. 

Research  by  non-profit  organisation  Catalyst  Balkans  found  that  Serbians  are  notably 

giving  more.  Citizens  donate  to  non-profit  organisations  more  often  than  before,  and 

to a greater extent through public fundraising campaigns, particularly via text 

message.  This  likely  reflects  the  growing  trust  that  citizens  feel  towards  the 

philanthropic ecosystem in Serbia. Serbia also saw an increase in GDP and average salary in 2021, suggesting Serbians may be better placed than in previous years to make donations. Serbia’s improved 

rankings  in  the  World  Giving  Index  also  reflect  several  years  of  promoting 

philanthropy, educational programs, and reporting on charities and philanthropy, in particular by the Coalition for Charity. The Covid-19 pandemic also mobilised the 

support  of  many  citizens  who  desired  to  help  others  in  a time  of  great  need.”

Helping a stranger remained the most widespread giving behaviour and reached record levels. Sierra Leone achieved the highest proportion of people 

(83%)  who  helped  someone  they  did  not  know.  It  was 

closely  followed  by  Venezuela  (82%),  Jamaica  (80%)  and 

the  United  States  (80%).  Five  of  the  top  10  countries 

where the most people helped a stranger were located 

in  South  and  Central  America.  The  effects  of  the 

pandemic and economic hardships likely led to higher levels of charitable engagement in developing countries, 

as  first  shown  in  last  year’s  World  Giving  Index. 

Cambodia and Japan were the countries with the lowest proportion of people who reported helping a stranger (23% and 24% respectively). Half of the countries found in the bottom ten are high-income European countries 

(France,  Switzerland,  the  Netherlands,  Italy,  Malta).  This 

is likely due in large part to the function of the welfare state, and the strong social safety nets that are in place in European countries. 4.0 | Helping a stranger

“The increase in giving recorded in Central and South America makes a heartening statement about the generosity present in these regions and their communities. This 

finding  is  also  not  altogether  surprising. 

Many countries across Central and South America were severely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic, prompting a surge in interpersonal aid – as evidenced by the strong representation of Central and South American nations among the countries ranked highest for helping a stranger. Moreover, tumultuous political situations in various countries across these regions led ordinary people to take responsibility for improving their communities. Indeed, in contexts where the actions of government 

bodies  appeared  limited  or  insufficient  in  meeting  people’s  needs,  many  individuals 

stepped  up  to  drive  aid  efforts.  This  report’s  findings  indicate  that  this  was  certainly 

the  case  in  Brazil,  as  well  as  for  many  of  our  neighbours.”

More people than ever donated money to charity in 2021. 

Indonesia  has  the  highest  proportion  of  people  (84%)  who 

donated money to charity in the world. Myanmar follows in 

second  place,  with  three  out  five  (73%)  adults  donating  money 

in 2021. As discussed in section 1.2, widespread donating in both countries is due in large part to religious giving and community-based cultural traditions. Seven out of the top 10 countries for donating money are high-income countries: the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and the United States remained in the top 10 for this measure. All countries in the bottom 10 for donating money were low-and middle-income. Georgia had the lowest proportion of people who donated money to a charity (3%). Seven out of the 10 bottom countries are in Africa. 5.0 | Donating money

18 Globally, nearly a quarter of all adults volunteer. Volunteering time saw a small increase from 19% to 23%, returning to pre-pandemic levels, in a similar trend to the other two measures. Despite the barriers produced by the pandemic, this is the highest rate of volunteering reported since 2009. Indonesia is the country with the highest rate of volunteering. Six out of ten adults (63%) in Indonesia reported that they volunteered in 2021. This is likely due in large part to the Indonesian principle of gotong royong (where local communities help and support each other during times of 

disaster),  which  revived  after  the  earthquake  of  2018 12 . During the pandemic, Indonesia demonstrated high levels of solidarity and a rate of volunteering time 2.7 times higher than the global average. Kenya is in second place for volunteering with a slightly increased score of 52%, up from 49% in 2020. Sierra Leone, which ranked #1 for helping a stranger, is in third place. As in Indonesia, Kenya’s philanthropic tradition and harambee spirit that unites people in times of need, seemed to play a critical role in participation and giving during the pandemic 13 .The United States is the only high-income country that occupied a place in the volunteering top 10, moving to #7 from #21 in 2020. The country with the lowest rate of volunteering is Egypt (4%). 

Egypt  has  been  blighted  by  poverty,  unrest  and  social  injustice 14 .The country saw a steep decline of ten percentage points in its overall Index score, and a six percentage point decline in volunteering in 2021. Serbia, which is one of the top 3 biggest risers on the overall Index, nevertheless remains in the bottom 10 countries for volunteering. In 2021 it ranked #116, with only 9% of people volunteering time. As discussed in section 3, Serbia recorded a 

sharp  jump  in  its  scores  for  helping  a stranger  and  donating 

money  over  the  past  five  years.  However,  the  country  has 

traditionally been among the lowest ranking nations in terms of volunteering time. 12  https://www.tandfonline.com/doi

19 Methodology 

The CAF World Giving Index is based on data from Gallup’s World View World Poll, 15  which  is  an  ongoing  research  project 

carried out in more than 100 countries and represents more than 90% of the global adult population. The survey asks 

questions  on  many  different  aspects  of  life  today  including  giving  behaviour.  The  countries  surveyed  and  questions  asked 

in each region vary from year to year and are determined by Gallup. More detail on Gallup’s methodology can be viewed online 16 .In most countries surveyed, one thousand questionnaires are completed by a representative sample of individuals living across the country. The sampling frame represents the entire civilian, non-institutionalised, aged-15-and-older population of the entire country including rural areas. In some bigger countries larger samples are collected. In a small number of countries, the poll covers 500 to 1,000 people but still features a representative sample. The survey is not 

conducted  in  a limited  number  of  instances  such  as  where  the  safety  of  interviewing  staff  is  threatened,  scarcely 

populated islands in some countries, and areas that interviewers can reach only by foot, animal or small boat. In all, 127,000 people were interviewed by Gallup in 2021. Samples are probability based and were carried out both by telephone and face-to-face 17 . The  findings  in  this  report  are  based  on  the  published  World  Poll  dataset  as  of  31st  March 

2022.  Country-specific  data  published  after  this  date  is  not  included  in  our  analysis. 

Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, in May 2020, Gallup decided that continuing with face-to-face interviewing (the usual data collection method in Central and Eastern Europe, Latin America, former Soviet states, developing Asia, the Middle East, and Africa) was not safe or appropriate. Gallup initiated its contingency data collection plans and moved to an entirely telephone-based methodology. In each country, all eligible landline and mobile service providers were included in the 

sample.  This  change  in  methodology  is  not  considered  to  have  had  a material  impact  on  the  findings  detailed  in  this 

report. There is a margin of error (the amount of random sampling error) inherent in the results for each country, calculated by 

Gallup  at  the  95%  confidence  level  (the  level  of  confidence  that  the  results  are  a true  reflection  of  the  whole  population). 

The maximum margin of error is calculated assuming a reported percentage of 50% and takes into account the design 

effect. It  is  worth  noting  that  in  2018  Gallup  made  substantial  changes  to  the  location  of  the  series  of  items  related  to  charitable 

giving within its World Poll questionnaire across all the countries interviewed. Within the countries where interviews 

were  conducted  face-to-face,  this  change  did  not  appear  to  affect  the  results.  However,  in  the  countries  where  interviews 

were conducted via telephone, it is unclear if these changes had some impact. CAF is monitoring subsequent results to determine if they have a substantive impact on longer term giving trends. As a result, we have not published the 

individual  country  findings  from  the  polling  conducted  in  2018. 

Calculation of CAF World Giving Index ranking 

The percentages shown in the index and within this publication are all rounded to the nearest whole number or to one decimal place. However, the analysis conducted by CAF uses percentage scores calculated to two decimal places. Due to rounding, there are some occasions in the ranking of countries where two or more countries appear to have the same 

percentage  but  are  not  placed  equally.  This  is  because  there  is  a small  amount  of  difference  in  the  numbers  to  two 

decimal places.
