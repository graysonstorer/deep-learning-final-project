December 5: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Friday, December 5, and this moment matters for Wikipedia because we haven't hit our goal yet. If you're like us, you've used Wikipedia countless times. To settle an argument with a friend. To satisfy a curiosity. Whether it's 3 in the morning or afternoon, Wikipedia is useful in your life. Please give $2.75.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a nonprofit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Just 2% of our readers donate, so if you have given in the past and Wikipedia still provides you with $2.75 worth of knowledge, donate today. If you are undecided, remember any contribution helps.

25 years of the internet at its **best**

 Accountability and transparency are core values at the Wikimedia Foundation. We manage funds and resources to ensure that every contribution supports our mission. We have earned the Platinum Seal of Transparency from Candid (formerly GuideStar), and Charity Navigator awarded us its highest rating. You can [read our most recent annual report](https://annual.wikimedia.org/) for more information about our financial health. 

 Investment in Technology 45%

We are constantly working to enhance the user experience for both contributors and readers, improve site security, and ensure reliable access to our websites globally. This infrastructure and product support sustain one of the top ten most visited websites in the world, all at a fraction of the cost of popular for-profit websites.

 Support for Volunteers 34%
The global reach of Wikimedia projects is made possible by the hard work of volunteers from across the globe. We provide grants, legal support, and other resources to help build vibrant volunteer communities. Additionally, we promote community engagement through outreach initiatives and advocate for the growth and protection of free knowledge.

 General and Administrative Expenses 12%
Operational costs are essential for the smooth management and governance of the Wikimedia Foundation. These expenses help us recruit top talent and support staff around the world, empowering them to carry out the mission of the Wikimedia Foundation.

 Allocation to Fundraising Efforts 11%
Donor support is crucial to sustaining Wikipedia and our other free knowledge endeavors. Our team is committed to efficient and effective fundraising throughout the year, ensuring that every contribution helps advance our mission.

The **United States of America** (**USA**), also known as the **United States** (**U.S.**) or **America**, is a country primarily located in [North America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America"). It is a [federal republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_republic "Federal republic") of 50 [states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._state "U.S. state") and a [federal capital district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_districts_and_territories "Capital districts and territories"), [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C.") The 48 [contiguous states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contiguous_states "Contiguous states") border [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada "Canada") to the north and [Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico "Mexico") to the south, with the [semi-exclave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-exclave "Semi-exclave") of [Alaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska "Alaska") in the northwest and the [archipelago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archipelago "Archipelago") of [Hawaii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaii "Hawaii") in the [Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean"). The United States also asserts sovereignty over five [major island territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territories_of_the_United_States "Territories of the United States") and [various uninhabited islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Minor_Outlying_Islands "United States Minor Outlying Islands") in [Oceania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceania "Oceania") and the [Caribbean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean "Caribbean").[[j]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-29) It is a [megadiverse country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megadiverse_country "Megadiverse country"), with the world's [third-largest land area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_area "List of countries and dependencies by area")[[c]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-largestcountry-15) and [third-largest population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population "List of countries and dependencies by population"), exceeding 340 million.[[k]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-pop_clock-32)

[Paleo-Indians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleo-Indians "Paleo-Indians") first migrated from North Asia to North America over 12,000 years ago, and formed various civilizations. [Spanish colonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_colonization_of_the_Americas "Spanish colonization of the Americas") established [Spanish Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Florida "Spanish Florida") in 1513, the first European colony in what is now the continental United States. [British colonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_colonization_of_the_Americas "British colonization of the Americas") followed with the 1607 settlement of [Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colony_of_Virginia "Colony of Virginia"), the first of the [Thirteen Colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies "Thirteen Colonies"). [Enslavement of Africans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_colonial_history_of_the_United_States "Slavery in the colonial history of the United States") was practiced in all colonies by 1770 and supplied most of the labor for the [Southern Colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Colonies "Southern Colonies")' [plantation economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation_economy "Plantation economy"). Clashes with the [British Crown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crown "The Crown") over taxation and lack of [parliamentary representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation "No taxation without representation") sparked the [American Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution "American Revolution"), leading to the [Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence "United States Declaration of Independence") on July 4, 1776. Victory in the 1775–1783 [Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War "American Revolutionary War") brought international recognition of U.S. sovereignty and fueled [westward expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_evolution_of_the_United_States "Territorial evolution of the United States"), dispossessing [native inhabitants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States "Native Americans in the United States"). As more states [were admitted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admission_to_the_Union "Admission to the Union"), a North–South [division over slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_states_and_free_states "Slave states and free states") led the [Confederate States of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America "Confederate States of America") to attempt secession and fight [the Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Union_(American_Civil_War) "Union (American Civil War)") in the 1861–1865 [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War"). With the United States' victory and reunification, [slavery was abolished nationally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution"). By 1900, the country had established itself as a [great power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_power "Great power"), a status solidified after its involvement in [World War I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"). Following [Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_of_Japan "Empire of Japan")'s [attack on Pearl Harbor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor "Attack on Pearl Harbor") in 1941, the U.S. [entered World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_entry_into_World_War_II "American entry into World War II"). [Its aftermath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath_of_World_War_II "Aftermath of World War II") left the U.S. and the [Soviet Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union") as rival [superpowers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superpower "Superpower"), competing for [ideological dominance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideological_dominance "Ideological dominance") and [international influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_influence "International influence") during the [Cold War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War"). The [Soviet Union's collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissolution_of_the_Soviet_Union "Dissolution of the Soviet Union") in 1991 ended the Cold War, leaving the U.S. as the world's sole superpower.

The [U.S. national government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States") is a [presidential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_system "Presidential system") constitutional federal republic and [representative democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_democracy "Representative democracy") with [three separate branches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution "Separation of powers under the United States Constitution"): [legislative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress"), [executive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_executive_departments "United States federal executive departments"), and [judicial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States "Federal judiciary of the United States"). It has a [bicameral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism "Bicameralism") national legislature composed of the [House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives "United States House of Representatives") (a [lower house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_house "Lower house") based on population) and the [Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate") (an [upper house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_house "Upper house") based on equal representation for each state). [Federalism grants substantial autonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism_in_the_United_States "Federalism in the United States") to the 50 states. In addition, 574 Native American tribes have [sovereignty rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_sovereignty_in_the_United_States "Tribal sovereignty in the United States"), and there are 326 [Native American reservations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_reservations "Native American reservations"). Since the 1850s, the [Democratic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) "Democratic Party (United States)") and [Republican](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States) "Republican Party (United States)") parties have dominated [American politics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_politics "American politics"), while [American values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americanism_(ideology) "Americanism (ideology)") are based on a democratic tradition inspired by the [American Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Enlightenment "American Enlightenment") movement.

A [developed country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developed_country "Developed country"), the [U.S. ranks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_rankings_of_the_United_States "International rankings of the United States") high in economic competitiveness, innovation, and [higher education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_in_the_United_States "Higher education in the United States"). Accounting for [over a quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal) "List of countries by GDP (nominal)") of nominal global GDP, [its economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_United_States "Economy of the United States") has been the world's largest [since about 1890](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_largest_historical_GDP "List of countries by largest historical GDP"). It is the [wealthiest country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_wealth "List of countries by total wealth"), with the [highest disposable household income per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disposable_household_and_per_capita_income#Household_disposable_income_per_capita_(OECD) "Disposable household and per capita income") among [OECD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD "OECD") members, though [its wealth inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_inequality_in_the_United_States "Wealth inequality in the United States") is highly pronounced. Shaped by centuries of immigration, the [culture of the U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_of_the_United_States "Culture of the United States") is diverse and [globally influential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americanization "Americanization"). Making up [more than a third](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_highest_military_expenditures "List of countries with highest military expenditures") of global military spending, the country has [one of the strongest militaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Armed_Forces "United States Armed Forces") and is a designated [nuclear state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_state "Nuclear state"). A member of [numerous international organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization_membership_of_the_United_States "International organization membership of the United States"), the U.S. plays a major role in global political, cultural, economic, and military affairs.

The term "United States" and its initialism "U.S.", used as nouns or as adjectives in English, are common short names for the country. The initialism "USA", a noun, is also common.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-36) "United States" and "U.S." are the established terms throughout the [U.S. federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States"), with prescribed rules.[[l]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-38) "The States" is an established colloquial shortening of the name, used particularly from abroad;[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-39) "stateside" is the corresponding adjective or adverb.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-40)

"America" is the feminine form of the first word of _Americus Vesputius_, the Latinized name of Italian explorer [Amerigo Vespucci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amerigo_Vespucci "Amerigo Vespucci") (1454–1512);[[m]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-41) it was first used as a place name by the German cartographers [Martin Waldseemüller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Waldseem%C3%BCller "Martin Waldseemüller") and [Matthias Ringmann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthias_Ringmann "Matthias Ringmann") in 1507.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-42)[[n]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-43) Vespucci first proposed that the [West Indies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies "West Indies") discovered by [Christopher Columbus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Columbus "Christopher Columbus") in 1492 were part of a previously unknown landmass and not among the Indies at the eastern limit of Asia.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-44)[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-45)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-locnamingofamerica-46) In English, [the term "America"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas_(terminology) "Americas (terminology)") usually does not refer to topics unrelated to the United States, despite the usage of "the [Americas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas "Americas")" to describe the totality of the continents of [North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America "North America") and [South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America "South America").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-47)

The _[Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration\_of\_Independence\_(painting) "Declaration of Independence (painting)")_ portrait depicts the [Committee of Five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Five "Committee of Five") presenting [the Declaration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence "United States Declaration of Independence") to the [Continental Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress "Second Continental Congress") on June 28, 1776, in [Philadelphia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia "Philadelphia").

Following their victory in the [French and Indian War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_and_Indian_War "French and Indian War"), Britain began to assert greater control over local colonial affairs, resulting in [colonial political resistance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution "American Revolution"); one of the primary colonial grievances was a denial of their [rights as Englishmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rights_of_Englishmen "Rights of Englishmen"), particularly the right to [representation in the British government that taxed them](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_taxation_without_representation "No taxation without representation"). To demonstrate their dissatisfaction and resolve, the [First Continental Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Continental_Congress "First Continental Congress") met in 1774 and passed the [Continental Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Association "Continental Association"), a colonial boycott of British goods enforced by local "[committees of safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_safety_(American_Revolution) "Committee of safety (American Revolution)")" that proved effective. The British attempt to then disarm the colonists resulted in the 1775 [Battles of Lexington and Concord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battles_of_Lexington_and_Concord "Battles of Lexington and Concord"), igniting the [American Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War "American Revolutionary War"). At the [Second Continental Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress "Second Continental Congress"), the colonies appointed [George Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington "George Washington") commander-in-chief of the [Continental Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Army "Continental Army"), and created [a committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Five "Committee of Five") that named [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson "Thomas Jefferson") to draft the [Declaration of Independence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence "United States Declaration of Independence"). Two days after passing the [Lee Resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Resolution "Lee Resolution") to create an independent nation the Declaration was adopted on July 4, 1776.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-YoungNash20112-84) The [political values of the American Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Enlightenment "American Enlightenment") evolved beyond an armed rebellion demanding reform within an empire to a revolution that created an entirely new social and governing system founded on the defense of [liberty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty "Liberty") and the protection of [inalienable individual rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_rights_and_legal_rights "Natural rights and legal rights"); [sovereignty of the people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_sovereignty "Popular sovereignty");[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-85)[republicanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republicanism_in_the_United_States "Republicanism in the United States") over [monarchy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy "Monarchy"), [aristocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristocracy "Aristocracy"), and other hereditary political power; [civic virtue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_virtue "Civic virtue"); and an intolerance of [political corruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_corruption "Political corruption").[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-86) The [Founding Fathers of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States "Founding Fathers of the United States"), who included Washington, Jefferson, [John Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams "John Adams"), [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "Benjamin Franklin"), [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton "Alexander Hamilton"), [John Jay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Jay "John Jay"), [James Madison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Madison "James Madison"), [Thomas Paine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine "Thomas Paine"), and many others, were inspired by [Classical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_republicanism#Classical_antecedents "Classical republicanism"), [Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_philosophy "Renaissance philosophy"), and [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment#Politics "Age of Enlightenment") philosophies and ideas.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-87)[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-SEoP-2006-88)

Though in practical effect since its drafting in 1777, the [Articles of Confederation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation "Articles of Confederation") was ratified in 1781 and formally established a decentralized government that operated until 1789.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-YoungNash20112-84) After the British surrender at the [siege of Yorktown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown "Siege of Yorktown") in 1781, American sovereignty was internationally recognized by the [Treaty of Paris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Paris_(1783) "Treaty of Paris (1783)") (1783), through which the U.S. gained territory stretching west to the Mississippi River, north to present-day Canada, and south to [Spanish Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Florida "Spanish Florida").[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-89) The [Northwest Ordinance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Ordinance "Northwest Ordinance") (1787) established the precedent by which the country's territory would expand with the [admission of new states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admission_to_the_Union "Admission to the Union"), rather than the expansion of existing states.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-90)

The [U.S. Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States "Constitution of the United States") was drafted at the 1787 [Constitutional Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention_(United_States) "Constitutional Convention (United States)") to overcome the limitations of the Articles. It went into effect in 1789, creating a [federal republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_republic "Federal republic") governed by [three separate branches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution "Separation of powers under the United States Constitution") that together formed a system of [checks and balances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checks_and_balances "Checks and balances").[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFoner2020524-91) George Washington [was elected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1788%E2%80%9389_United_States_presidential_election "1788–89 United States presidential election") the country's first president under the Constitution, and the [Bill of Rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights "United States Bill of Rights") was adopted in 1791 to allay skeptics' concerns about the power of the more centralized government.[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFoner2020538%E2%80%93540-92)[His resignation as commander-in-chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Washington%27s_resignation_as_commander-in-chief "George Washington's resignation as commander-in-chief") after the Revolutionary War and his later refusal to run for a third term as the country's first president established a precedent for the supremacy of civil authority in the United States and the [peaceful transfer of power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peaceful_transition_of_power "Peaceful transition of power").[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-BoyerJr.20072-93)

[Territorial expansion of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_evolution_of_the_United_States "Territorial evolution of the United States")

In the late 18th century, American settlers began to [expand westward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_evolution_of_the_United_States "Territorial evolution of the United States") in larger numbers, many with a sense of [manifest destiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifest_destiny "Manifest destiny").[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-MD20072-94)[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcPherson198841%E2%80%9346-95) The [Louisiana Purchase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase "Louisiana Purchase") of 1803 from France nearly doubled the territory of the United States.[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-96)[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-97)[Lingering issues with Britain remained](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_the_War_of_1812 "Origins of the War of 1812"), leading to the [War of 1812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812 "War of 1812"), which was fought to a draw.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Wait19992-98)[Spain ceded Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs_Treaty "Adams–Onís Treaty") and its Gulf Coast territory in 1819.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-KloseJones19942-99)

The [Missouri Compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Compromise "Missouri Compromise") of 1820, which admitted [Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri "Missouri") as a [slave state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_states_and_free_states "Slave states and free states") and [Maine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maine#Statehood "Maine") as a free state, attempted to balance the desire of northern states to prevent the expansion of slavery into new territories with that of southern states to extend it there. Primarily, the compromise prohibited slavery in all other lands of the Louisiana Purchase north of the [36°30′ parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_36%C2%B030%E2%80%B2_north "Parallel 36°30′ north").[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-100)

As Americans expanded further into territory inhabited by Native Americans, the [federal government implemented policies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Indian_Policy "Federal Indian Policy") of [Indian removal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_removal "Indian removal") or [assimilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_assimilation_of_Native_Americans "Cultural assimilation of Native Americans").[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-101)[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-102) The most significant such legislation was the [Indian Removal Act of 1830](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Removal_Act "Indian Removal Act"), a key policy of President [Andrew Jackson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Jackson "Andrew Jackson"). It resulted in the [Trail of Tears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trail_of_Tears "Trail of Tears") (1830–1850), in which an estimated 60,000 Native Americans living east of the [Mississippi River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mississippi_River "Mississippi River") were forcibly removed and displaced to lands far to the west, causing 13,200 to 16,700 deaths along the forced march.[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcPherson198845-103) Settler expansion as well as this influx of Indigenous peoples from the East resulted in the [American Indian Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Indian_Wars "American Indian Wars") west of the Mississippi.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-104)[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-BillingtonRidge2001j2-105)

During the colonial period, [slavery became legal in all the Thirteen colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_colonial_history_of_the_United_States "Slavery in the colonial history of the United States"), but by 1770 it provided the main labor force in the [large-scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plantation_complexes_in_the_Southern_United_States "Plantation complexes in the Southern United States"), [agriculture-dependent economies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antebellum_South#Economic_structure "Antebellum South") of the [Southern Colonies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Colonies "Southern Colonies") from Maryland to Georgia. The practice began to be significantly questioned during the American Revolution, [[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWalker_Howe200752%E2%80%9354Wright2022-106) and spurred by an active [abolitionist movement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States "Abolitionism in the United States") that had reemerged in the 1830s, states in [the North](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_United_States "Northern United States") enacted laws to prohibit slavery within their boundaries.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWalker_Howe200752%E2%80%9354Rodriguez2015XXXIVWright2022-107) At the same time, [support for slavery had strengthened in Southern states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-slavery_ideology_in_the_United_States "Pro-slavery ideology in the United States"), with widespread use of inventions such as the [cotton gin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cotton_gin "Cotton gin") (1793) having made slavery immensely profitable for [Southern elites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planter_class "Planter class").[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-108)[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-109)[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWalker_Howe2007478,_481%E2%80%93482,_587%E2%80%93588-110)

The United States [annexed the Republic of Texas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_annexation "Texas annexation") in 1845,[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Morrison19992-111) and the 1846 [Oregon Treaty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Treaty "Oregon Treaty") led to U.S. control of the present-day [American Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwestern_United_States "Northwestern United States").[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Kemp20102-112) Dispute with Mexico over Texas led to the [Mexican–American War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War "Mexican–American War") (1846–1848). After the victory of the U.S., Mexico recognized U.S. sovereignty over Texas, [New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico "New Mexico"), and [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California "California") in the 1848 [Mexican Cession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican_Cession "Mexican Cession"); the cession's lands also included the future states of [Nevada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevada "Nevada"), [Colorado](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado "Colorado") and [Utah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah "Utah").[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-MD20072-94)[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-McIlwraithMuller20012-113) The [California gold rush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_gold_rush "California gold rush") of 1848–1849 spurred a huge migration of white settlers to the Pacific coast, leading to even more confrontations with Native populations. One of the most violent, the [California genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_genocide "California genocide") of thousands of Native inhabitants, lasted into the mid-1870s.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-114) Additional western territories and states were created.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Rawls1999-115)

[Slave states and free states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_states_and_free_states "Slave states and free states") in 1858

Throughout the 1850s, the [sectional conflict regarding slavery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slave_states_and_free_states "Slave states and free states") was further inflamed by national legislation in the U.S. Congress and decisions of the Supreme Court. In Congress, the [Fugitive Slave Act of 1850](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugitive_Slave_Act_of_1850 "Fugitive Slave Act of 1850") mandated the forcible return to their owners in the South of slaves taking refuge in non-slave states, while the [Kansas–Nebraska Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas%E2%80%93Nebraska_Act "Kansas–Nebraska Act") of 1854 effectively gutted the anti-slavery requirements of the Missouri Compromise.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-116) In its [Dred Scott decision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dred_Scott_v._Sandford "Dred Scott v. Sandford") of 1857, the Supreme Court ruled against a slave brought into non-slave territory, simultaneously declaring the entire Missouri Compromise to be unconstitutional. These and other [events exacerbated tensions between North and South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origins_of_the_American_Civil_War "Origins of the American Civil War") that would culminate in the [American Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War") (1861–1865).[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-117)[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Woods_2012_pp._415%E2%80%934392-118)

Beginning with [South Carolina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Carolina "South Carolina"), 11 slave-state governments voted to [secede from the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secession_in_the_United_States "Secession in the United States") in 1861, joining to create the [Confederate States of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America "Confederate States of America").

Efforts toward [reconstruction in the secessionist South](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_era "Reconstruction era") had begun as early as 1862,[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDubois1935163-128) but it was only after [President Lincoln's assassination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Abraham_Lincoln "Assassination of Abraham Lincoln") that the three [Reconstruction Amendments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reconstruction_Amendments "Reconstruction Amendments") to the Constitution were ratified [to protect civil rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement_(1865%E2%80%931896) "Civil rights movement (1865–1896)"). The amendments codified nationally the abolition of slavery and involuntary servitude except as punishment for crimes, promised equal protection under the law for all persons, and prohibited discrimination on the basis of race or previous enslavement.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-129)[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFoner198866-7,_251-261,_446-449-130)[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-131) As a result, African Americans took an active political role in ex-Confederate states in the decade following the Civil War.[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFoner1988xxv-132)[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEDubois1935381-727-133) The former Confederate states were readmitted to the Union, beginning with Tennessee in 1866 and ending with Georgia in 1870.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-134)[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-135)

National infrastructure, including [transcontinental telegraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_transcontinental_telegraph "First transcontinental telegraph") and [railroads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_transcontinental_railroad "First transcontinental railroad"), spurred growth in the [American frontier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_frontier "American frontier"). This was accelerated by the [Homestead Acts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_Acts "Homestead Acts"), through which nearly 10 percent of the total land area of the United States was given away free to some 1.6 million homesteaders.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Black2011kj2-136)[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-137) From 1865 through 1917, an unprecedented stream of [immigrants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigrants "Immigrants") arrived in the United States, including 24.4 million from Europe.[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-138) Most came through the [Port of New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_New_York_and_New_Jersey "Port of New York and New Jersey"), and New York City and other large cities on the [East Coast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States "East Coast of the United States") became home to large [Jewish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_in_the_United_States "History of the Jews in the United States"), [Irish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Americans "Irish Americans"), and [Italian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Americans "Italian Americans") populations.

[An explosion of technological advancement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Industrial_Revolution "Second Industrial Revolution") accompanied by the exploitation of cheap immigrant labor[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-148) led to [rapid economic expansion during the late 19th and early 20th centuries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilded_Age "Gilded Age"), allowing the United States to outpace the economies of England, France, and Germany combined.[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-149)[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-150) This fostered the amassing of power by [a few prominent industrialists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robber_baron_(industrialist) "Robber baron (industrialist)"), largely by their formation of [trusts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_(business) "Trust (business)") and [monopolies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly "Monopoly") to prevent competition.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Atlantic2-151)[Tycoons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tycoon "Tycoon") led the nation's expansion in the [railroad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_rail_transportation_in_the_United_States "History of rail transportation in the United States"), [petroleum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_petroleum_industry_in_the_United_States "History of the petroleum industry in the United States"), and [steel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_steel_industry_(1850%E2%80%931970) "History of the steel industry (1850–1970)") industries.

The U.S. asserts sovereignty over five [unincorporated territories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territories_of_the_United_States "Territories of the United States") and [several uninhabited island possessions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Minor_Outlying_Islands "United States Minor Outlying Islands").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-HRI-2012-28)[[229]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEOnuf2010xvii-246) It is the world's oldest surviving federation,[[230]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-247) and its [presidential system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_system "Presidential system") of national government has been adopted, in whole or in part, by many newly independent states worldwide following their [decolonization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decolonization "Decolonization").[[231]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-248) The [Constitution of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States "Constitution of the United States") serves as [the country's supreme legal document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause "Supremacy Clause").[[232]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-249) Most scholars describe the United States as a [liberal democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_democracy "Liberal democracy").[[233]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Scheb-250)[[r]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-262)

### Federal government

Main article: [Federal government of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States")

Composed of three branches, all headquartered in Washington, D.C., the federal government is the national government of the United States. The [U.S. Constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Constitution "U.S. Constitution") establishes a [separation of powers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_powers "Separation of powers") intended to provide a system of [checks and balances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Checks_and_balances "Checks and balances") to prevent any of the three branches from becoming supreme.[[245]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-263)

*   The [U.S. Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress "United States Congress") is a [bicameral legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameral_legislature "Bicameral legislature") made up of the [Senate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate "United States Senate") and the [House of Representatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives "United States House of Representatives"). The Senate has 100 members—two residents from each state and elected by that state's voters for a six-year term. The House of Representatives has 435 members, elected for a two-year term by the constituency of the [congressional district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_congressional_districts "List of United States congressional districts") where they reside. A [state's legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States) "State legislature (United States)") decides the district boundaries, which are contiguous within the state. Every U.S. congressional district is of equivalent population and sends one representative to Congress.[[246]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-264) Election years for senators are staggered so that only one-third of them will be up for election every two years.[[247]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-265) U.S. representatives are all up for election at the same time every two years. The U.S. Congress makes [federal law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law "Federal law"), [declares war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_of_war "Declaration of war"), approves treaties, has the [power of the purse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_the_purse "Power of the purse"),[[248]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-266) and has [the power of impeachment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_in_the_United_States "Impeachment in the United States").[[249]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-267) One of its foremost non-legislative functions is [the power to investigate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_investigation "Congressional investigation") and oversee the executive branch.[[250]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-tws2010Sep11t11-268)[Congressional oversight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_oversight "Congressional oversight") is usually delegated to committees and is facilitated by [Congress's power to issue subpoenas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress "Contempt of Congress").[[251]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-tws2010Sep11t13-269) Much of the work of Congress is performed by [a collection of committees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_congressional_committee "United States congressional committee"), each appointed for a specific purpose or function. Committee membership is by tradition and statute [bipartisan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipartisan "Bipartisan"), but all committees are [chaired](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chair_(officer) "Chair (officer)") by a member of the [majority party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_party "Majority party"), who sets the committee agenda.[[252]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-270)

[JD Vance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD_Vance "JD Vance")

[Vice President](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States "Vice President of the United States")

*   The U.S. president is the [head of state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_state "Head of state"), [commander-in-chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-chief "Commander-in-chief") of the military, [chief executive of the federal government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_of_government "Head of government"), and has the ability to veto [legislative bills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_(law) "Bill (law)") from the U.S. Congress before they become law. However, [presidential vetoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto_power_in_the_United_States "Veto power in the United States") can be overridden by a two-thirds [supermajority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Use_in_governments_around_the_world "Supermajority") vote in both chambers of Congress. The president appoints the [members of the Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States "Cabinet of the United States"), subject to Senate approval, and names other officials who administer and enforce federal law and policy through [their respective agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_agencies_in_the_United_States "List of federal agencies in the United States").[[253]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-271) The president also has clemency power for federal crimes and [can issue pardons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_pardons_in_the_United_States "Federal pardons in the United States"). Finally, the president has the authority to issue expansive "[executive orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_orders "Executive orders")" in a number of policy areas, subject to [judicial review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review_in_the_United_States "Judicial review in the United States"). Candidates for president campaign with a vice-presidential [running mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate "Running mate"). Both candidates are elected together, or defeated together, in a presidential election. Unlike other votes in American politics, this is technically an [indirect election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_election "Indirect election") in which the winner will be determined by the [U.S. Electoral College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College "United States Electoral College"). There, votes are officially cast by individual electors selected by [their state legislature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States) "State legislature (United States)").[[254]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-272) In practice, however, each of the 50 states chooses a group of presidential electors who are required by state law to confirm the winner of their state's popular vote. Each state is allocated two electors plus one additional elector for every congressional district in the state, which in effect combines to equal the number of elected officials that state sends to Congress. The District of Columbia, with no representatives or senators, is allocated three electoral votes. Both the president and the vice president serve a four-year term, and the president may be [reelected to the office only once](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution "Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution"), for one additional four-year term.[[s]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-273)
*   The [U.S. federal judiciary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States "Federal judiciary of the United States"), whose judges are all appointed for life by the president with Senate approval, consists primarily of the [U.S. Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States "Supreme Court of the United States"), the [U.S. courts of appeals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals "United States courts of appeals"), and the [U.S. district courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court "United States district court"). The lowest level in the federal judiciary is the federal district court, which decides all cases considered to be under "[original jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_jurisdiction#Federal_and_state_courts "Original jurisdiction")", such as federal statutes, constitutional law, or [international treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_treaties "International treaties"). After a federal district court has decided a case, its decision may be contested and sent to a higher court, a federal court of appeals. The U.S. judicial system's 12 federal circuits divide the country into 12 separate geographic administrative regions for appeals decisions. The next and highest court in the system is the Supreme Court of the United States.[[255]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FedJud-274) The U.S. Supreme Court interprets laws and [overturns those it finds unconstitutional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review "Judicial review").[[255]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FedJud-274) On average, the Supreme Court receives about 7,000 appeals petitions for [writs of certiorari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writs_of_certiorari "Writs of certiorari") each year, but only grants about 80.[[256]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-275) Consisting of nine members led by the [Chief Justice of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States "Chief Justice of the United States"), the court judges each case before it by majority decision. As with all other federal judges, the members are appointed for life by the sitting president with Senate approval when a vacancy becomes available.[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-276)

The three-branch system is known as the [presidential system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_system "Presidential system"), in contrast to the [parliamentary system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_system "Parliamentary system") where the executive is part of the legislative body. Many countries around the world adopted this aspect of the 1789 Constitution of the United States, especially in the [postcolonial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postcolonialism "Postcolonialism") Americas.[[258]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Sundquist-277)

In the [U.S. federal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalism_in_the_United_States "Federalism in the United States"), sovereign powers are shared between three levels of government specified in the Constitution: the national government, the states, and Indian tribes.[[259]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-3Sovereigns-278)[[260]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FelixSCohen-279) The U.S. also asserts sovereignty over five permanently inhabited territories: [American Samoa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Samoa "American Samoa"), [Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guam "Guam"), the [Northern Mariana Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Mariana_Islands "Northern Mariana Islands"), [Puerto Rico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rico "Puerto Rico"), and the [U.S. Virgin Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Virgin_Islands "United States Virgin Islands").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-HRI-2012-28)

Residents of the 50 states are governed by their elected state government, under [state constitutions compatible with the national constitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_constitutions_in_the_United_States "State constitutions in the United States"), and by elected [local governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_the_United_States "Local government in the United States") that are administrative divisions of a state.[[261]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-280) States are subdivided into counties or county equivalents, and (except for Hawaii) [further divided into municipalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_government_in_the_United_States "Local government in the United States"), each administered by elected representatives. The District of Columbia is [a federal district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_district_of_the_United_States "Federal district of the United States") containing the U.S. capital, [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C.")[[262]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-281) The federal district is an administrative division of the federal government.[[263]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-282)

They hold a government-to-government relationship with the U.S. federal government in Washington and are legally defined as [domestic dependent nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domestic_dependent_nations "Domestic dependent nations") with [inherent tribal sovereignty rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribal_sovereignty_in_the_United_States "Tribal sovereignty in the United States").[[260]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FelixSCohen-279)[[259]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-3Sovereigns-278)[[264]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-283)[[265]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-www.justice.gov-2017-284)

In addition to the five major territories, the U.S. also asserts sovereignty over the [United States Minor Outlying Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Minor_Outlying_Islands "United States Minor Outlying Islands") in the [Pacific Ocean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean "Pacific Ocean") and the [Caribbean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caribbean "Caribbean").[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-HRI-2012-28) The seven undisputed islands without permanent populations are [Baker Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baker_Island "Baker Island"), [Howland Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howland_Island "Howland Island"), [Jarvis Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarvis_Island "Jarvis Island"), [Johnston Atoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnston_Atoll "Johnston Atoll"), [Kingman Reef](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingman_Reef "Kingman Reef"), [Midway Atoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midway_Atoll "Midway Atoll"), and [Palmyra Atoll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmyra_Atoll "Palmyra Atoll").

Divided partisan control

The Constitution is silent on political parties. However, they developed independently in the 18th century with the [Federalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federalist_Party "Federalist Party") and [Anti-Federalist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Federalist_Party "Anti-Federalist Party") parties.[[266]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Hofstadter-1969-iv-285) Since then, the United States has operated as a _de facto_[two-party system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-party_system "Two-party system"), though the parties have changed over time.[[267]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Blake-2021-286) Since the mid-19th century, the two main national parties have been the [Democratic Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_(United_States) "Democratic Party (United States)") and the [Republican Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States) "Republican Party (United States)"). The former is perceived as [relatively liberal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States "Modern liberalism in the United States") in [its political platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_the_Democratic_Party_(United_States) "Political positions of the Democratic Party (United States)") while the latter is perceived as [relatively conservative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism_in_the_United_States "Conservatism in the United States") in [its platform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_the_Republican_Party_(United_States) "Political positions of the Republican Party (United States)").[[268]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-287)

[The Pentagon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pentagon "The Pentagon"), the headquarters of the [U.S. Department of Defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense "United States Department of Defense") in [Arlington County, Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arlington_County,_Virginia "Arlington County, Virginia"), is one of the world's largest office buildings with over 6.5 million square feet (600,000 m 2) of [floor space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_space "Floor space").

The president is the [commander-in-chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commander-in-Chief_of_the_United_States "Commander-in-Chief of the United States") of the United States Armed Forces and appoints its leaders, the [secretary of defense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense "United States Secretary of Defense") and the [Joint Chiefs of Staff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Chiefs_of_Staff "Joint Chiefs of Staff").

[State defense forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_defense_forces "State defense forces") (SDFs) are military units that operate under the sole authority of a state government. SDFs are authorized by state and federal law but are under the command of [the state's governor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_(United_States) "Governor (United States)").[[308]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-327)[[309]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-328)[[310]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-329) By contrast, a state's [National Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Guard_(United_States) "National Guard (United States)") units are under the dual control of [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_governments_of_the_United_States "State governments of the United States") and [federal governments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States "Federal government of the United States"); such units can also become federalized entities, but SDFs cannot be federalized.[[311]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-330) A state's National Guard personnel can be federalized by the president under the [National Defense Act Amendments of 1933](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Defense_Act_of_1916#National_Defense_Act_Amendments_of_1933 "National Defense Act of 1916"), which created the Guard and provides for the integration of [Army National Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_National_Guard "Army National Guard")&[Air National Guard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_National_Guard "Air National Guard") units and personnel into the U.S. Army and (since 1947) the U.S. Air Force.[[312]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-331)

[J. Edgar Hoover Building](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Edgar_Hoover_Building "J. Edgar Hoover Building"), the headquarters of the [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation "Federal Bureau of Investigation") (FBI), in [Washington, D.C.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C. "Washington, D.C.")

There are about 18,000 U.S. police agencies from local to national level in the United States.[[313]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-332) Law in the United States is mainly enforced by local police departments and [sheriff departments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheriffs_in_the_United_States "Sheriffs in the United States") in their municipal or county jurisdictions. [The state police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_police_(United_States) "State police (United States)") departments [have authority in their respective state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_power_(United_States_constitutional_law) "Police power (United States constitutional law)"), and [federal agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_law_enforcement_in_the_United_States "Federal law enforcement in the United States") such as the [Federal Bureau of Investigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation "Federal Bureau of Investigation") (FBI) and the [U.S. Marshals Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Marshals_Service "United States Marshals Service") have national jurisdiction and specialized duties, such as protecting [civil rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights "Civil rights"), [national security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_of_the_United_States "National security of the United States"), enforcing [U.S. federal courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._federal_courts "U.S. federal courts")' rulings and federal laws, and interstate criminal activity.[[314]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-333)[State courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_court_(United_States) "State court (United States)") conduct almost all civil and criminal trials,[[315]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-334) while federal courts [adjudicate the much smaller number of civil and criminal cases that relate to federal law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject-matter_jurisdiction "Subject-matter jurisdiction").[[316]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-335)

There is no unified "criminal justice system" in the United States. The [American prison system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incarceration_in_the_United_States "Incarceration in the United States") is largely heterogenous, with thousands of relatively independent systems operating across federal, state, local, and tribal levels. In 2025, "these systems hold [nearly 2 million people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_incarceration_rate "United States incarceration rate") in 1,566 state prisons, 98 federal prisons, 3,116 local jails, 1,277 juvenile correctional facilities, 133 immigration detention facilities, and 80 Indian country jails, as well as in military prisons, civil commitment centers, state psychiatric hospitals, and prisons in the U.S. territories."[[317]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Sawyer-2025-336)

Despite disparate systems of confinement, four main institutions dominate: [federal prisons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_federal_prisons "List of United States federal prisons"), [state prisons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lists_of_United_States_state_prisons "Lists of United States state prisons"), local jails, and [juvenile correctional facilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_juvenile_justice_system "American juvenile justice system").[[318]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-National_Academies_Press-2014-337) Federal prisons are run by the [Federal Bureau of Prisons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Prisons "Federal Bureau of Prisons") and hold pretrial detainees as well as people who have been convicted of federal crimes.[[318]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-National_Academies_Press-2014-337) State prisons, run by the department of corrections of each state, hold people sentenced and serving prison time (usually longer than one year) for felony offenses.[[318]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-National_Academies_Press-2014-337) Local jails are county or municipal facilities that incarcerate defendants prior to trial; they also hold those serving short sentences (typically under a year).[[318]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-National_Academies_Press-2014-337) Juvenile correctional facilities are operated by local or state governments and serve as longer-term placements for any [minor adjudicated as delinquent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_delinquency "Juvenile delinquency") and ordered by a judge to be confined.[[319]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-338)

The United States' 4 million miles (6.4 million kilometers) of road network, owned almost entirely by state and local governments, is the [longest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_road_network_size "List of countries by road network size") in the world.[[407]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-427)[[408]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-428) The extensive [Interstate Highway System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System "Interstate Highway System") that connects all major U.S. cities is funded mostly by the federal government but maintained by [state departments of transportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._state_and_insular_area_departments_of_transportation "List of U.S. state and insular area departments of transportation"). The system is further extended by [state highways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_highway#United_States "State highway") and some private [toll roads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toll_road "Toll road").

The U.S. is among the top ten countries with the [highest vehicle ownership per capita](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_vehicles_per_capita "List of countries by vehicles per capita") (850 vehicles per 1,000 people) in 2022. A 2022 study found that 76% of U.S. commuters drive alone and 14% ride a bicycle, including bike owners and users of [bike-sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bike-sharing "Bike-sharing") networks. About 11% use some form of public transportation.[[409]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-429)[[410]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-430)

[Public transportation in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transportation_in_the_United_States "Public transportation in the United States") is well developed in the largest urban areas, notably New York City, Washington, D.C., Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, and San Francisco; otherwise, coverage is generally less extensive than in most other developed countries. The U.S. also has many relatively [car-dependent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car-dependent "Car-dependent") localities.[[411]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-431)

Long-distance intercity travel is provided primarily by airlines, but travel by rail is more common along the [Northeast Corridor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_Corridor "Northeast Corridor"), the only [high-speed rail in the U.S.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-speed_rail_in_the_United_States "High-speed rail in the United States") that meets international standards. [Amtrak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amtrak "Amtrak"), the country's government-sponsored national passenger rail company, has a relatively sparse network compared to that of Western European countries. Service is concentrated in the Northeast, California, the Midwest, the Pacific Northwest, and Virginia/Southeast.

The United States has an extensive air transportation network. [U.S. civilian airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airlines_of_the_United_States "List of airlines of the United States") are all privately owned. The three largest airlines in the world, by total number of passengers carried, are U.S.-based; [American Airlines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines "American Airlines") became the global leader after its 2013 merger with [US Airways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Airways "US Airways").[[414]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-434) Of the 50 busiest airports in the world, 16 are in the United States, as well as five of the top 10.[[415]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-PANYNJ_2021_report-435) The world's busiest airport by passenger volume is [Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartsfield%E2%80%93Jackson_Atlanta_International_Airport "Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport") in [Atlanta, Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta "Atlanta").[[412]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-BusyAirport-432)[[415]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-PANYNJ_2021_report-435) In 2022, most of the [19,969 U.S. airports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_airports_in_the_United_States "List of airports in the United States")[[416]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-436) were owned and operated by local government authorities, and there are also some private airports. Some 5,193 are designated as "public use", including for [general aviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_aviation "General aviation"). The [Transportation Security Administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_Security_Administration "Transportation Security Administration") (TSA) has provided security at most major airports since 2001.

[The country's rail transport network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_transport_in_the_United_States "Rail transport in the United States"), the [longest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_rail_transport_network_size "List of countries by rail transport network size") in the world at 182,412.3 mi (293,564.2 km),[[417]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-437) handles mostly [freight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight_transport "Freight transport")[[418]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-438)[[419]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-439) (in contrast to more passenger-centered rail in Europe[[420]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-440)). Because they are often privately owned operations, U.S. railroads lag behind those of the rest of the world in terms of electrification.[[421]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-441)

[The country's inland waterways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inland_waterways_of_the_United_States "Inland waterways of the United States") are the world's [fifth-longest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_waterways_length "List of countries by waterways length"), totaling 25,482 mi (41,009 km).[[422]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-442) They are used extensively for freight, recreation, and a small amount of passenger traffic. Of the world's [50 busiest container ports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_busiest_container_ports "List of busiest container ports"), four are located in the United States, with the busiest in the country being the [Port of Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Los_Angeles "Port of Los Angeles").[[423]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-443)

Most spoken languages in the U.S.

While many languages are spoken in the United States, [English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_English "American English") is by far the most commonly spoken and written.[[435]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-456)_[De facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_facto "De facto")_, English is the [official language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_language "Official language") of the United States, and in 2025, [Executive Order 14224](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_14224 "Executive Order 14224") declared English official.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-EOWP-4) However, the U.S. has never had a _[de jure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De\_jure "De jure")_ official language, as Congress has never passed a law to designate English as official for all three federal branches. Some laws, such as [U.S. naturalization requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalized_citizen_of_the_United_States "Naturalized citizen of the United States"), nonetheless standardize English. Twenty-eight states and the [United States Virgin Islands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Virgin_Islands "United States Virgin Islands") have laws that designate English as the sole official language; 19 states and the [District of Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_of_Columbia "District of Columbia") have no official language.[[436]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-457) Three states and four U.S. territories have recognized local or indigenous languages in addition to English: Hawaii ([Hawaiian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawaiian_language "Hawaiian language")),[[437]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-458) Alaska ([twenty Native languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaska_Native_languages "Alaska Native languages")),[[v]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-459)[[438]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-460) South Dakota ([Sioux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sioux_language "Sioux language")),[[439]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-LakotaCommon-461) American Samoa ([Samoan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoan_language "Samoan language")), Puerto Rico ([Spanish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_language_in_the_United_States "Spanish language in the United States")), Guam ([Chamorro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chamorro_language "Chamorro language")), and the Northern Mariana Islands ([Carolinian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolinian_language "Carolinian language") and Chamorro). In total, 169 Native American languages are spoken in the United States.[[440]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-462) In Puerto Rico, Spanish is more widely spoken than English.[[441]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-PuertoRicoTranslation-463)

About 82% of Americans live in [urban areas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_urban_area "United States urban area"), including suburbs;[[345]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-CIA-2018-364) about half of those reside in cities with populations over 50,000.[[463]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-485) In 2022, 333 [incorporated municipalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_cities_by_population "List of United States cities by population") had populations over 100,000, nine cities had more than one million residents, and four cities—[New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"), [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles "Los Angeles"), [Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago "Chicago"), and [Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston "Houston")—had populations exceeding two million.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-486) Many U.S. metropolitan populations are growing rapidly, particularly in the South and West.[[465]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-487)

[![Image 60](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a3/Texas_medical_center.jpg/250px-Texas_medical_center.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Texas_medical_center.jpg)

The [Texas Medical Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Medical_Center "Texas Medical Center") in [Houston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Houston "Houston") is the largest medical complex in the world.[[467]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-489)[[468]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-490) In 2018, it employed 120,000 people and treated 10 million patients.[[469]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-491)

According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centers_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention "Centers for Disease Control and Prevention") (CDC), average American life expectancy at birth was 78.4 years in 2023 (75.8 years for men and 81.1 years for women). This was a gain of 0.9 year from 77.5 years in 2022, and the CDC noted that the new average was largely driven by "decreases in mortality due to COVID-19, heart disease, unintentional injuries, cancer and diabetes".[[470]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-492) Starting in 1998, life expectancy in the U.S. fell [behind that of other wealthy industrialized countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy "List of countries by life expectancy"), and Americans' "health disadvantage" gap has been increasing ever since.[[471]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-493)

The Commonwealth Fund reported in 2020 that the U.S. had the [highest suicide rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_suicide_rate "List of countries by suicide rate") among [high-income countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-income_countries "High-income countries").[[472]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-494)[Approximately one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obesity_in_the_United_States "Obesity in the United States") and another third is overweight.[[473]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-495) The U.S. healthcare system far [outspends that of any other country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_(PPP)_per_capita "List of countries by total health expenditure (PPP) per capita"), measured both in per capita spending and as a percentage of GDP, but attains worse healthcare outcomes when compared to peer countries for reasons that are debated.[[474]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-496) The United States is the only developed country [without a system of universal healthcare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthcare_reform_in_the_United_States "Healthcare reform in the United States"), and [a significant proportion of the population that does not carry health insurance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_insurance_coverage_in_the_United_States "Health insurance coverage in the United States").[[475]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-497) Government-funded healthcare coverage for the poor ([Medicaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid "Medicaid")) and for those age 65 and older ([Medicare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States) "Medicare (United States)")) is available to Americans who meet the programs' income or age qualifications. In 2010, then-President Obama passed the [Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act "Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act").[[w]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-498)[[476]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-499)[Abortion in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_the_United_States "Abortion in the United States") is not federally protected, and is illegal or restricted in 17 states.[[477]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-500)

### Education

Main article: [Education in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_the_United_States "Education in the United States")

[![Image 61: Photograph of the University of Virginia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/19/University_of_Virginia_Rotunda_in_2006.jpg/250px-University_of_Virginia_Rotunda_in_2006.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:University_of_Virginia_Rotunda_in_2006.jpg)

Some 77% of American college students attend public institutions[[478]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-501) such as the [University of Virginia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Virginia "University of Virginia"), founded by [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson "Thomas Jefferson") in 1819.

American primary and secondary education, known in the U.S. as [K–12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%E2%80%9312_education_in_the_United_States "K–12 education in the United States") ("kindergarten through 12th grade"), is decentralized. School systems are operated by state, territorial, and sometimes municipal governments and regulated by the [U.S. Department of Education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Education "United States Department of Education"). In general, children are required to attend school or [an approved homeschool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeschooling_in_the_United_States "Homeschooling in the United States") from the age of five or six ([kindergarten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindergarten "Kindergarten") or [first grade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_grade "First grade")) until they are 18 years old. This often brings students through the [12th grade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelfth_grade "Twelfth grade"), the final year of a U.S. high school, but some states and territories allow them to leave school earlier, at age 16 or 17.[[479]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-502) The U.S. spends more on education per student than any other country,[[480]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-503) an average of $18,614 per year per public elementary and secondary school student in 2020–2021.[[481]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-504) Among Americans age 25 and older, 92.2% graduated from high school, 62.7% attended some college, 37.7% earned a [bachelor's degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree "Bachelor's degree"), and 14.2% earned a graduate degree.[[482]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-505) The [U.S. literacy rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literacy_in_the_United_States "Literacy in the United States") is near-universal.[[345]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-CIA-2018-364)[[483]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-506) The U.S. has produced the [most Nobel Prize winners of any country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nobel_laureates_by_country "List of Nobel laureates by country"), with [411](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_Nobel_laureates "List of American Nobel laureates") (having won 413 awards).[[484]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-507)[[485]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-508)

[U.S. tertiary or higher education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_education_in_the_United_States "Higher education in the United States") has earned a global reputation. Many of the world's top universities, as listed by various ranking organizations, are in the United States, including 19 of the top 25.[[486]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-509)[[487]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-510) American higher education is dominated by [state university systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_university_system "State university system"), although [the country's many private universities and colleges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_universities_in_the_United_States "Private universities in the United States") enroll about 20% of all American students. Local [community colleges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_colleges_in_the_United_States "Community colleges in the United States") generally offer [open admissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_admissions "Open admissions"), lower tuition, and coursework leading to a two-year [associate degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associate_degree "Associate degree") or a [non-degree certificate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_program "Certificate program").[[488]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-511)

As for [public expenditures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_expenditure "Public expenditure") on higher education, the U.S. spends more per student than the [OECD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD "OECD") average, and Americans spend more than all nations in combined public and private spending.[[489]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-education_spending-512) Colleges and universities directly funded by the federal government do not charge tuition and are limited to military personnel and government employees, including: the [U.S. service academies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_service_academies "United States service academies"), the [Naval Postgraduate School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naval_Postgraduate_School "Naval Postgraduate School"), and [military staff colleges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_military_staff_colleges "US military staff colleges"). Despite some student [loan forgiveness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loan_forgiveness "Loan forgiveness") programs in place,[[490]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-513)[student loan debt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student_debt "Student debt") increased by 102% between 2010 and 2020,[[491]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-514) and exceeded $1.7 trillion in 2022.[[492]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-515)

[Mark Twain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain "Mark Twain"), whom [William Faulkner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Faulkner "William Faulkner") called "the father of American literature"[[531]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-faulkner-554)

Colonial American authors were influenced by [John Locke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke "John Locke") and other [Enlightenment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment") philosophers.[[532]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBaymLevine2013157%E2%80%93159-555)[[533]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTELauter1994a503%E2%80%93509-556) The [American Revolutionary Period](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution "American Revolution") (1765–1783) is notable for the political writings of [Benjamin Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "Benjamin Franklin"), [Alexander Hamilton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton "Alexander Hamilton"), [Thomas Paine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Paine "Thomas Paine"), and [Thomas Jefferson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson "Thomas Jefferson"). Shortly before and after the [Revolutionary War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War "American Revolutionary War"), the newspaper rose to prominence, filling a demand for anti-British national literature.[[534]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBaymLevine2013163-557)[[535]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-558) An early novel is [William Hill Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Hill_Brown "William Hill Brown")'s _[The Power of Sympathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Power\_of\_Sympathy "The Power of Sympathy")_, published in 1791. Writer and critic [John Neal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Neal "John Neal") in the early- to mid-19th century helped advance America toward a unique literature and culture by criticizing predecessors such as [Washington Irving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Irving "Washington Irving") for imitating their British counterparts, and by influencing writers such as [Edgar Allan Poe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe "Edgar Allan Poe"),[[536]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-559) who took American poetry and short fiction in new directions. [Ralph Waldo Emerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson "Ralph Waldo Emerson") and [Margaret Fuller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Fuller "Margaret Fuller") pioneered the influential [Transcendentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcendentalism "Transcendentalism") movement;[[537]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-560)[[538]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Coviello-561)[Henry David Thoreau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_David_Thoreau "Henry David Thoreau"), author of _[Walden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walden "Walden")_, was influenced by this movement.

The conflict surrounding [abolitionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abolitionism_in_the_United_States "Abolitionism in the United States") inspired writers, like [Harriet Beecher Stowe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harriet_Beecher_Stowe "Harriet Beecher Stowe"), and authors of slave narratives, such as [Frederick Douglass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Douglass "Frederick Douglass"). [Nathaniel Hawthorne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathaniel_Hawthorne "Nathaniel Hawthorne")'s _[The Scarlet Letter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Scarlet\_Letter "The Scarlet Letter")_ (1850) explored the dark side of American history, as did [Herman Melville](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herman_Melville "Herman Melville")'s _[Moby-Dick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby-Dick "Moby-Dick")_ (1851). Major American poets of the 19th century [American Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Renaissance_(literature) "American Renaissance (literature)") include [Walt Whitman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman "Walt Whitman"), Melville, and [Emily Dickinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_Dickinson "Emily Dickinson").[[539]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBaymLevine2013444%E2%80%93447-562)[[540]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTELauter1994a1228,_1233,_1260-563)[Mark Twain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain "Mark Twain") was the first major American writer to be born in the West. [Henry James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_James "Henry James") achieved international recognition with novels like _[The Portrait of a Lady](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Portrait\_of\_a\_Lady "The Portrait of a Lady")_ (1881). As literacy rates rose, periodicals published more stories centered around industrial workers, women, and the rural poor.[[541]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBaymLevine20131269%E2%80%931270-564)[[542]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTELauter1994b8%E2%80%9310-565)[Naturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naturalism_(literature) "Naturalism (literature)"), [regionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_literary_regionalism "American literary regionalism"), and [realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_realism#UnitedStates "Literary realism") were the major literary movements of the period.[[543]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBaymLevine20131271%E2%80%931273-566)[[544]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTELauter1994b12-567)

While [modernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literary_modernism "Literary modernism") generally took on an international character, modernist authors working within the United States more often rooted their work in specific regions, peoples, and cultures.[[545]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBaymLevine20131850%E2%80%931851-568) Following the Great Migration to northern cities, African-American and black [West Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indian_Americans "West Indian Americans") authors of the [Harlem Renaissance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_Renaissance "Harlem Renaissance") developed an independent tradition of literature that rebuked a history of inequality and celebrated black culture. An important cultural export during the [Jazz Age](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Age "Jazz Age"), these writings were a key influence on _[Négritude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C3%A9gritude "Négritude")_, a philosophy emerging in the 1930s among francophone writers of the [African diaspora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_diaspora "African diaspora").[[546]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-569)[[547]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-570) In the 1950s, an ideal of homogeneity led many authors to attempt to write the [Great American Novel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_American_Novel "Great American Novel"),[[548]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBaymLevine20132260%E2%80%932261-571) while the [Beat Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_Generation "Beat Generation") rejected this conformity, using styles that elevated the impact of the [spoken word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoken_word "Spoken word") over mechanics to describe drug use, sexuality, and the failings of society.[[549]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBaymLevine20132262-572)[[550]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-573) Contemporary literature is more pluralistic than in previous eras, with the closest thing to a unifying feature being a trend toward self-conscious [experiments with language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_literature "Experimental literature").[[551]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBaymLevine20132266%E2%80%932267-574) Twelve American laureates have won the [Nobel Prize in Literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Literature "Nobel Prize in Literature").[[552]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-575)

[Broadway theaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theater "Broadway theater") in [Theater District, Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theater_District,_Manhattan "Theater District, Manhattan")

The United States is well known for its theater. Mainstream theater in the United States derives from the old European theatrical tradition and has been heavily influenced by the [British theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_the_United_Kingdom "Theatre of the United Kingdom").[[565]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Saxon2011-588) By the middle of the 19th century, America had created new distinct dramatic forms in the [Tom Shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Shows "Tom Shows"), the [showboat theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Showboat "Showboat") and the [minstrel show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minstrel_show "Minstrel show").[[566]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-589) The central hub of the American theater scene is the [Theater District in Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theater_District,_Manhattan "Theater District, Manhattan"), with its divisions of [Broadway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broadway_theatre "Broadway theatre"), [off-Broadway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-Broadway "Off-Broadway"), and [off-off-Broadway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-off-Broadway "Off-off-Broadway").[[567]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Londr%C3%A9Watermeier1998-590)

Many movie and television [celebrities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebrity "Celebrity") have gotten their big break working in New York productions. Outside New York City, many cities have professional [regional or resident theater companies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_theater_in_the_United_States "Regional theater in the United States") that produce their own seasons. The biggest-budget theatrical productions are musicals. U.S. theater has an active [community theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_theater "Community theater") culture.[[568]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-591)

The [Tony Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Awards "Tony Awards") recognizes excellence in live Broadway theater and are presented at an annual ceremony in [Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan "Manhattan"). The awards are given for Broadway productions and performances. One is also given for [regional theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_theatre_in_the_United_States "Regional theatre in the United States"). Several discretionary non-competitive awards are given as well, including a [Special Tony Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Tony_Award "Special Tony Award"), the [Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Honors_for_Excellence_in_Theatre "Tony Honors for Excellence in Theatre"), and the [Isabelle Stevenson Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabelle_Stevenson_Award "Isabelle Stevenson Award").[[569]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-592)

_[American Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American\_Gothic "American Gothic")_ (1930) by [Grant Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Wood "Grant Wood") is one of the most famous [American paintings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_art_of_the_United_States "Visual art of the United States") and is widely [parodied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parody "Parody").[[570]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-BBC-593)

[Folk art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folk_art_of_the_United_States "Folk art of the United States") in [colonial America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_america "Colonial america") grew out of artisanal [craftsmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workmanship "Workmanship") in communities that allowed commonly trained people to individually express themselves. It was distinct from Europe's tradition of [high art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_culture "High culture"), which was less accessible and generally less relevant to early American settlers.[[571]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-594) Cultural movements in art and craftsmanship in colonial America generally lagged behind those of Western Europe. For example, the prevailing medieval style of [woodworking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodworking "Woodworking") and primitive [sculpture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture_of_the_United_States "Sculpture of the United States") became integral to early American folk art, despite the emergence of [Renaissance styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance_art "Renaissance art") in England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The new English styles would have been early enough to make a considerable impact on American folk art, but American styles and forms had already been firmly adopted. Not only did styles change slowly in early America, but there was a tendency for rural artisans there to continue their traditional forms longer than their urban counterparts did—and far longer than those in Western Europe.[[511]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Coleman-2013-534)

The [Hudson River School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson_River_School "Hudson River School") was a mid-19th-century movement in the visual arts tradition of European [naturalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realism_(arts) "Realism (arts)"). The 1913 [Armory Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armory_Show "Armory Show") in New York City, an exhibition of European [modernist art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_art "Modern art"), shocked the public and transformed the U.S. art scene.[[572]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-595)

[American Realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Realism "American Realism") and [American Regionalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Regionalism "American Regionalism") sought to reflect and give America new ways of looking at itself. [Georgia O'Keeffe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgia_O%27Keeffe "Georgia O'Keeffe"), [Marsden Hartley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsden_Hartley "Marsden Hartley"), and others experimented with new and individualistic styles, which would become known as [American modernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_modernism "American modernism"). Major artistic movements such as the [abstract expressionism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_expressionism "Abstract expressionism") of [Jackson Pollock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock "Jackson Pollock") and [Willem de Kooning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_de_Kooning "Willem de Kooning") and the [pop art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_art "Pop art") of [Andy Warhol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Warhol "Andy Warhol") and [Roy Lichtenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Lichtenstein "Roy Lichtenstein") developed largely in the United States. Major photographers include [Alfred Stieglitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Stieglitz "Alfred Stieglitz"), [Edward Steichen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Steichen "Edward Steichen"), [Dorothea Lange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorothea_Lange "Dorothea Lange"), [Edward Weston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Weston "Edward Weston"), [James Van Der Zee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Van_Der_Zee "James Van Der Zee"), [Ansel Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ansel_Adams "Ansel Adams"), and [Gordon Parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Parks "Gordon Parks").[[573]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Davenport1991-596)

The tide of [modernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernism "Modernism") and then [postmodernism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmodernism "Postmodernism") has brought global fame to American architects, including [Frank Lloyd Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Lloyd_Wright "Frank Lloyd Wright"), [Philip Johnson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Johnson "Philip Johnson"), and [Frank Gehry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Gehry "Frank Gehry").[[574]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-JansonJanson2003-597) The [Metropolitan Museum of Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_Museum_of_Art "Metropolitan Museum of Art") in [Manhattan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan "Manhattan") is the largest [art museum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_museum "Art museum") in the United States[[575]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-METLargestArtMuseum-598) and the [fourth-largest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_art_museums "List of largest art museums") in the world.[[576]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-599)

Many traditional songs have been sung within the same family or folk group for generations, and sometimes trace back to such origins as the [British Isles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Isles "British Isles"), [mainland Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainland_Europe "Mainland Europe"), or [Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African-American_music "African-American music").[[577]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-afc-600) The rhythmic and lyrical styles of African-American music in particular have influenced American music.[[578]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-601)[Banjos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banjo "Banjo") were brought to America through the slave trade. [Minstrel shows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minstrel_show "Minstrel show") incorporating the instrument into their acts led to its increased popularity and widespread production in the 19th century.[[579]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-602)[[580]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FOOTNOTEShi2016378-603) The [electric guitar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_guitar "Electric guitar"), first invented in the 1930s, and mass-produced by the 1940s, had an enormous influence on popular music, in particular due to the development of [rock and roll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_and_roll "Rock and roll").[[581]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-axe-604) The [synthesizer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthesizer "Synthesizer"), [turntablism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turntablism "Turntablism"), and [electronic music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music "Electronic music") were also largely developed in the U.S.

Elements from folk idioms such as the [blues](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blues "Blues") and [old-time music](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-time_music "Old-time music") were adopted and transformed into [popular genres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_music "Popular music") with global audiences. [Jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz "Jazz") grew from blues and [ragtime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ragtime "Ragtime") in the early 20th century, developing from the innovations and recordings of composers such as [W.C.

A [Thanksgiving dinner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_dinner "Thanksgiving dinner") with [roast turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roast_turkey "Roast turkey"), [mashed potatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mashed_potatoes "Mashed potatoes"), [pickles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickled_cucumber "Pickled cucumber"), [corn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn "Corn"), [candied yams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candied_yams "Candied yams"), [cranberry jelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranberry_jelly "Cranberry jelly"), [shrimps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shrimp_and_prawn_as_food "Shrimp and prawn as food"), [stuffing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuffing "Stuffing"), [green peas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_peas "Green peas"), [deviled eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deviled_eggs "Deviled eggs"), [green salad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_salad "Green salad"), and [apple sauce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_sauce "Apple sauce")

Early settlers were introduced by Native Americans to foods such as [turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkey_as_food "Turkey as food"), [sweet potatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweet_potato "Sweet potato"), [corn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maize "Maize"), [squash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucurbita "Cucurbita"), and [maple syrup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maple_syrup "Maple syrup"). Of the most enduring and pervasive examples are variations of the native dish called [succotash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Succotash "Succotash"). Early settlers and later immigrants combined these with foods they were familiar with, such as [wheat flour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_flour "Wheat flour"),[[626]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Wheat-649) beef, and milk, to create a distinctive American cuisine.[[627]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-650)[[628]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-651)[New World crops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_crops "New World crops"), especially [pumpkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumpkin "Pumpkin"), corn, [potatoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potatoes "Potatoes"), and turkey as the main course are part of a shared national menu on [Thanksgiving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanksgiving_(United_States) "Thanksgiving (United States)"), when many Americans prepare or purchase traditional dishes to celebrate the occasion.[[629]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Mintz1996-652)

Characteristic American dishes such as [apple pie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_pie "Apple pie"), [fried chicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fried_chicken "Fried chicken"), [doughnuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doughnut "Doughnut"), [french fries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_fries "French fries"), [macaroni and cheese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaroni_and_cheese "Macaroni and cheese"), [ice cream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_cream "Ice cream"), [hamburgers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger "Hamburger"), [hot dogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_dog "Hot dog"), and [American pizza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_in_the_United_States "Pizza in the United States") derive from the recipes of various immigrant groups.[[630]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-653)[[631]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-654)[[632]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-655)[[633]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-656)[Mexican dishes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican-American_cuisine "Mexican-American cuisine") such as [burritos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burritos "Burritos") and [tacos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacos "Tacos") preexisted the United States in areas later annexed from Mexico, and [adaptations of Chinese cuisine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Chinese_cuisine "American Chinese cuisine") as well as [pasta dishes freely adapted from Italian sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian-American_cuisine "Italian-American cuisine") are all widely consumed.[[634]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-IFT-657)

American [chefs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chef "Chef") have had a significant impact on society both domestically and internationally. In 1946, the [Culinary Institute of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culinary_Institute_of_America "Culinary Institute of America") was founded by [Katharine Angell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katharine_Cramer_Angell "Katharine Cramer Angell") and [Frances Roth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Roth "Frances Roth"). This would become the United States' most prestigious culinary school, where many of the most talented American chefs would study prior to successful careers.[[635]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-658)[[636]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FTfbs-659) The [United States restaurant industry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_restaurant_industry "United States restaurant industry") was projected at $899 billion in sales for 2020,[[637]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Brownfield-2020-660)[[638]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Ramirez-661) and employed more than 15 million people, representing 10% of the nation's workforce directly.[[637]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Brownfield-2020-660) It is the country's second-largest private employer and the third-largest employer overall.[[639]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Noguchi-2020-662)[[640]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-663) The United States is home to over 220 [Michelin star](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin_star "Michelin star")-rated restaurants, 70 of which are in New York City alone.[[641]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-664)

[Wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_wine "American wine") has been produced in what is now the United States since the 1500s, with the [first widespread production beginning in what is now New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_wine "New Mexico wine") in 1628.[[642]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-665)[[643]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Birchell_Steel_2013_p.-666)[[644]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-New_Mexico._Office_of_Cultural_Affairs_1995_p.-667) In the modern U.S., wine production is undertaken in all fifty states, with [California producing 84 percent of all U.S. wine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_wine "California wine"). With more than 1,100,000 acres (4,500 km 2) under vine, the United States is the [fourth-largest wine-producing country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_wine_production "List of countries by wine production") in the world, after [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_wine "Italian wine"), [Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_wine "Spanish wine"), and [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_wine "French wine").[[645]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Sotheby,_p._462-668)[[646]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Oxford,_p._719-669)

The [classic American diner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diner "Diner"), a casual restaurant type originally intended for the working class, emerged during the 19th century from converted railroad [dining cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_car "Dining car") made stationary. The diner soon evolved into purpose-built structures whose number expanded greatly in the 20th century.[[647]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-670) The American [fast-food](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-food "Fast-food") industry developed alongside the nation's [car culture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_culture "Car culture").[[648]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-671) American restaurants developed the [drive-in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-in "Drive-in") format in the 1920s, which they began to replace with the [drive-through](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-through "Drive-through") format by the 1940s.[[649]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-drivethru-672)[[650]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-673) American [fast-food restaurant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast-food_restaurant "Fast-food restaurant") chains, such as [McDonald's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s "McDonald's"), [Burger King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burger_King "Burger King"), [Chick-fil-A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chick-fil-A "Chick-fil-A"), [Kentucky Fried Chicken](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentucky_Fried_Chicken "Kentucky Fried Chicken"), [Dunkin' Donuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunkin%27_Donuts "Dunkin' Donuts") and [many others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fast_food_restaurant_chains#United_States "List of fast food restaurant chains"), have numerous outlets around the world.[[651]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-Pavlova-2019-674)

### Sports

Main articles: [Sports in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_in_the_United_States "Sports in the United States") and [United States at the Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics "United States at the Olympics")

[![Image 71](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Delhomme_goes_deep.jpg/250px-Delhomme_goes_deep.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Delhomme_goes_deep.jpg)

[American football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football "American football") is the most popular sport in the United States; in this 2009 [National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League "National Football League") game, [Carolina Panthers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carolina_Panthers "Carolina Panthers") quarterback [Jake Delhomme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jake_Delhomme "Jake Delhomme") (number 17) throws a forward pass against the [Dallas Cowboys](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Cowboys "Dallas Cowboys").

The most popular spectator sports in the U.S. are [American football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_football_in_the_United_States "American football in the United States"), [basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_in_the_United_States "Basketball in the United States"), [baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_in_the_United_States "Baseball in the United States"), [soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soccer_in_the_United_States "Soccer in the United States"), and [ice hockey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_in_the_United_States "Ice hockey in the United States").[[652]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-675) While most major U.S. sports such as baseball and American football have evolved out of European practices, basketball, [volleyball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volleyball_in_the_United_States "Volleyball in the United States"), [skateboarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding "Skateboarding"), and [snowboarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowboarding "Snowboarding") are American inventions, many of which have become popular worldwide.[[653]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-676)[Lacrosse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lacrosse_in_the_United_States "Lacrosse in the United States") and [surfing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surfing_in_the_United_States "Surfing in the United States") arose from Native American and Native Hawaiian activities that predate European contact.[[654]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-liss-677) The [market for professional sports in the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_sports_market_in_the_United_States "Professional sports market in the United States") was approximately $69 billion in July 2013, roughly 50% larger than that of Europe, the Middle East, and Africa combined.[[655]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-678)

American football is by several measures the most popular spectator sport in the United States;[[656]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-679) the [National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League "National Football League") has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the [Super Bowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl "Super Bowl") is watched by tens of millions globally.[[657]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-680) However, baseball has been regarded as the U.S. "[national sport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_sport "National sport")" since the late 19th century. After American football, the next four most popular professional team sports are basketball, baseball, soccer, and ice hockey. Their premier leagues are, respectively, the [National Basketball Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Basketball_Association "National Basketball Association"),[[658]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-681)[Major League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball "Major League Baseball"),[[659]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-682)[Major League Soccer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Soccer "Major League Soccer"),[[660]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-683) and the [National Hockey League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Hockey_League "National Hockey League").[[661]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-684) The most-watched [individual sports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_sport "Individual sport") in the U.S. are [golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_in_the_United_States "Golf in the United States") and [auto racing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auto_racing "Auto racing"), particularly [NASCAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASCAR "NASCAR") and [IndyCar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndyCar "IndyCar").[[662]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-685)[[663]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-686)

On the [collegiate level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_athletics_in_the_United_States "College athletics in the United States"), earnings for the member institutions exceed $1 billion annually,[[664]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-si-687) and [college football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_football "College football") and [basketball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_basketball "College basketball") attract large audiences, as the [NCAA March Madness tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCAA_Division_I_men%27s_basketball_tournament "NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament") and the [College Football Playoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_Football_Playoff "College Football Playoff") are some of the most watched national sporting events.[[665]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-688) In the U.S., the intercollegiate sports level serves as the main feeder system for professional and Olympic sports, with significant exceptions such as [Minor League Baseball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minor_League_Baseball "Minor League Baseball"). This differs greatly from practices in nearly all other countries, where publicly and privately funded sports organizations serve this function.[[666]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-689)

Eight [Olympic Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games "Olympic Games") have taken place in the United States. The [1904 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1904_Summer_Olympics "1904 Summer Olympics") in [St. Louis, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Louis,_Missouri "St. Louis, Missouri"), were the first-ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.[[667]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-690) The Olympic Games will be held in the U.S. for a ninth time when Los Angeles hosts the [2028 Summer Olympics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2028_Summer_Olympics "2028 Summer Olympics"). [U.S. athletes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics "United States at the Olympics") have won a total of 2,968 medals (1,179 gold) at the Olympic Games, the most of any country.[[668]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-691)[[669]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-692)[[670]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-693)

In other international competition, the United States is the home of a number of prestigious events, including the [Americas Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americas_Cup "Americas Cup"), [World Baseball Classic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Baseball_Classic "World Baseball Classic"), the [U.S. Open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Open_(tennis) "U.S. Open (tennis)"), and the [Masters Tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_Tournament "Masters Tournament"). The [U.S. men's national soccer team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_men%27s_national_soccer_team "United States men's national soccer team") has qualified for [eleven World Cups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_FIFA_World_Cup "United States at the FIFA World Cup"), while the [women's national team](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_women%27s_national_soccer_team "United States women's national soccer team") has [won](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup "United States at the FIFA Women's World Cup") the [FIFA Women's World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup "FIFA Women's World Cup") and [Olympic soccer tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_at_the_Summer_Olympics "Football at the Summer Olympics") four times each.[[671]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-694) The [1999 FIFA Women's World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup "1999 FIFA Women's World Cup") was hosted by the United States. [Its final match](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1999_FIFA_Women%27s_World_Cup_final "1999 FIFA Women's World Cup final") was attended by 90,185, setting the world record for largest women's sporting event crowd at the time.[[672]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-695) The United States hosted the [1994 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1994_FIFA_World_Cup "1994 FIFA World Cup") and will co-host, along with Canada and Mexico, the [2026 FIFA World Cup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_FIFA_World_Cup "2026 FIFA World Cup").[[673]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-696)

As with the Beer Hall Putsch, a would-be leader tried to take advantage of an already scheduled event (in Hitler's case, Kahr's speech; in Trump's, Congress's tallying of the electoral votes) to create a dramatic moment with himself at the center of attention, calling for bold action to upend the political order. Unlike Hitler's coup attempt, Trump already held top of office, so he was attempting to hold onto power, not seize it (the precise term for Trump's intended action is a 'self-coup' or 'autogolpe'). Thus, Trump was able to plan for the event well in advance, and with much greater control, including developing the legal arguments that could be used to justify rejecting the election's results.

[Trump] tried to delegitimize the election results by disseminating a series of far fetched and evidence-free claims of fraud. Meanwhile, with a ring of close confidants, Trump conceived and implemented unprecedented schemes to– in his own words– "overturn" the election outcome. Among the results of this "Big Lie" campaign were the terrible events of January 6, 2021– an inflection point in what we now understand was nothing less than an attempted coup.

Their campaign was not confined to the ivory tower– it was a coup in search of a legal theory. The plan spurred violent attacks on the seat of our nation's government, led to the deaths of several law enforcement officers, and deepened public distrust in our political process... If Dr. Eastman and President Trump's plan had worked, it would have permanently ended the peaceful transition of power, undermining American democracy and the Constitution. If the country does not commit to investigating and pursuing accountability for those responsible, the Court fears January 6 will repeat itself.").
