# The Fall of Stalinism: Ten Years On

Stalinist industrialization, while immiserating millions, also created a large industrial working class. Indeed, the working class revolted throughout decades of Stalinism, notably in East Germany in 1953, Hungary and Poland in 1956, Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Poland in 1980-81.49

In 1989, the contradictions that Cliff described could no longer be contained by the ruling classes. The countries of the Soviet empire, especially Russia, were experiencing serious economic crisis and growing difficulties maintaining their legitimacy.

Rather than outstripping and defeating capitalism, the more privatized and market-driven form of capitalism in the West outpaced the bureaucratized, state-dominated capitalism of Russia and its satellites. As Cliff points out, “In the first five year plan the annual rate of growth of the [Russian] economy was 19.2 percent. In the period 1950-59 it was 5.8 percent. In the 1970s the growth rate was 3.7 percent annually. And then it went down to 1 percent [in the 1980s].”50

The economic stagnation, the drudgery and alienation of work, the stifling of culture and intellectual life by the bureaucracy and the harshness of living conditions produced a popular desire for change. When the dam began to break, the workers did not defend the “workers’ states” because there was nothing that was theirs to defend.

The collapse

In the mid-1980s, elements of the Stalinist bureaucracy recognized that they could not maintain control, overcome crisis or compete effectively with Western capitalism without offering some reforms. In 1986, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Gorbachev launched a program of _perestroika_(restructuring) and _glasnost_ (openness). Thousands took advantage of the new cracks in the Stalinist edifice to express their desire for change.

In 1988 and 1989, strikes and illegal rallies took place in Russia, Hungary, East Germany and elsewhere. Ten thousand people held an illegal demonstration in March 1988 in Hungary, demanding “democracy, free speech and freedom of the press.”51 During the same period, Russia was confronted with nationalist movements in Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Uzbekistan and several other republics.52 As one East German recalled ten years later, “A feeling arose that things had to change.”53

In the summer of 1989, when Hungary opened its borders, thousands of East German refugees crossed to escape to the West. On October 18, East German hard-liner Erich Honecker, who had ruled in East Germany since 1971, was pushed out of office. When his replacement, Egon Krenz, visited Gorbachev in Moscow on October 31, Gorbachev indicated that he was opposed to reunification of East and West Germany, but that he would not back the use of force to contain the flow of refugees from the East. On the evening of November 9, when protesters gathered at the Berlin Wall and demanded to be allowed across, the leadership buckled. Several protesters were allowed across, and then the dam broke.54

When they sensed that repression alone could not contain the crisis, the Stalinist bureaucracies faced a decision: be pushed or jump. In the end, both took place. Under the pressure of protests, strikes and demonstrations, the regimes fell one by one.

Millions took to the streets to express their desire for change, but only in Romania was violence used in any significant way, when the hated dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife were executed on Christmas in 1989.

Two hundred thousand people demonstrated in Prague on November 20, 1989.55 The protests grew to include broad sections of workers who joined strikes to bring down the government.56 Within days, the number in the streets had soared to as many as 800,000 calling for a fundamental change. On November 27, millions walked out of work for a two-hour general strike.57

Protests spread like wildfire. An East German socialist described the mood of the time:

> In the first few months after the revolution everything seemed to have changed. We were seized with the idea of being able to change everything. People became more confident. Ordinary people spoke at demonstrations and meetings. We won the right to travel, freedom of opinion and...the right to strike.58

“Shock therapy”

The expectations for change were bound to come up against the limitation of the changes taking place in Eastern Europe. We should not underestimate the significance of the revolutions that took place; but, in reality, the same managers ran the plants the next day, the same police officers and security forces remained intact, and yesterday’s Communist _apparatchik_ became today’s “democrat,” “free marketeer” or “reformer.”

If those who thought the Soviet Union and its satellites were socialist were right, then how could capitalism have replaced socialism almost overnight without any radical restructuring of the way production was organized and with only minor changes to the names and titles within the ruling class?

What happened was actually a step sideways. It was not a transition from socialism to capitalism, but a restructuring of capitalism, similar in fact to the kind of restructuring the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have overseen in Bolivia, Brazil and other countries.59

Though some in the bureaucracy tried to cling to the same ways of ruling, the more forward-looking elements of the ruling class realized that it was no longer possible to survive using the old means of control. They sought to preserveóand actually, in many ways, to extendótheir power and privileges through opening up to and cooperating with multinational capitalism.

Even before the collapse, one Hungarian sociologist remarked in 1988:

> It is not unusual today to meet a family belonging to the Kadariste oligarchy where the father is a high ranking party or state official, the daughter owns a town centre clothes shop, the eldest son represents a Western company in Hungary, the son in law is the chairman of a recently created company or a Western bank and a grandmother owns a family hotel on the edge of Lake Balaton.60

In Poland, a recent study of the former Stalinist _nomenklatura_ found that one-quarter had set up their own firms or held high-ranking jobs in private companies, 15 to 20 percent held high-ranking jobs in state companies and 15 percent received special high-paying pensions.61

The new ruling classes in Eastern Europeóthough headed by dissidents such as Lech Walesa, who had led the working-class Solidarity movement in Polandósaw their task as encouraging “enterprise” and competition. In fact, they oversaw the imposition of harsh austerity measures, called “shock therapy,” in order to compete more effectively with other capitalist countries. Sacrifice for a short time, workers were told, and you will soon be rewarded.

But the promises that politicians made for the market and the New World Order all turned out to be false. “I thought there would be a very difficult transition lasting three years, five years, seven years,” the Russian politician Anatoly Chubais said recently. “Now it is clear that it will take decades.”62

Like everywhere else that capitalism has been restructured, this process has had a devastating impact on the working class. While they have gained important freedoms, workers have faced repeated rounds of cuts in social spending, growing unemployment and privatization. Contrary to all the triumphalist rhetoric about how the market would bring happiness and a Western standard of living to the former Communist countries, most people’s standard of living actually took a step backward. Poland, East Germany and the Czech Republic, which split from its poorer partner Slovakia in 1993, have seen growth and wage improvements, but they have also seen unemployment rise to unprecedented levels. East German unemployment now stands at 20 percent. In Poland, the _New York Times_ reported, “the zloty has fallen by about 15 percent this year, a once high-flying stock market has been pummeled, unemployment is now over 10 percent, fuel prices are rising, and anger over layoffs in loss-making heavy industries like steel and coal has boiled over.”63

_The Economist_ magazine now glibly admits:

> Heading west has not brought instant contentment. Far from it...It has been a rough decade. The euphoria of political freedom wore off quickly as the pain of economic reform began to bite...The very workersóship-builders and miners, for instanceówho have done so much to bring down communism were often the first to lose their jobs in the brave new world...The gap between the haves and have-nots is widening...In almost every ex-communist country, standards of health care have plunged. In some, lives have suddenly grown shorter.64

From 1987 to 1997, life expectancy declined in Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, Russia and the Ukraine.65

According to new World Bank figures, “In Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union...the number of people who are living under the poverty line of $4 a day has grown, from 14 million in 1989 to 147 million today.”66

In 1997, the _New York Times_ reported:

> Russian men are dying in middle age at a rate unparalleled in modern history...Per capita alcohol consumption is the highest in the world...A wider gap has developed in life expectancy between men (59) and women (73) than in any other country...The death rate among working-age Russians today is higher than a century ago...The raw number of sick children, appallingly high by any standard, appears lower this year only because so few children have been born over the past several years...The Russian population fell by 480,000 last year, the steepest such decline in any year since World War II.67

The situation is worse in nonurban areas. In Dzerzhinsk, which is only 250 miles east of Moscow, “life expectancy is just 42 years for men, 47 for women. Serfs breaking rocks in the Czar’s Russia lived longer than that.”68

The story is brutalóbut it is version of the same story of what capitalism looks like today around the globe.69 In Tanzania, for example, “one in six children die before the age of five, and almost one-third of the population will not live until 40. Yet...[in 1998], more than one-third of the budget will go to external debt servicing. On a per capita basis...this means that Tanzania has been spending nine times as much on debt servicing as on basic health.”70

Ten years after

The year 1989 did not mark the dawn of a new world order of peace and prosperity. Instead, it was the beginning of a period that has seen the 1991 Gulf War and the ongoing war against Iraq, where sanctions have led to hundreds of thousands of Iraqi deaths; the economic crisis in the former Soviet republics and Yugoslavia, in which nationalist leaders like Franjo Tudjman in Croatia and Slobodan Milosevic in Serbia sought to preserve their power by whipping up ethnic nationalism and provoking ethnic cleansing on a mass scale; NATO’s brutal war on Yugoslavia to extend the power and influence of the U.S. and the other NATO powers; and an international arms-spending and nuclear-weapons race.

These events have thoroughly disoriented much of the left. It was, after all, governments of the left, even ones calling themselves “socialist,” that cheered NATO’s assault in the Balkans the most vociferously and pushed hardest for a ground war.

The editors of _Dissent_, the journal of the Democratic Socialists of America, now celebrate their own political confusion and retreats. In a featured contribution to a special issue, “Ten Years After the Fall,” editorial board member Paul Berman writes:

> Universally despised phrases like “the third way” sound bracing and attractive, in my ears, because, at least, they imply a turn against the assumptions of the pastÖ

Every left-wing discussion from now on should begin with the question...What do we actively support today that would have provoked our indignation yesterday?71

In the same forum, the Polish dissident Adam Michnik praises Ronald Reagan, whose “description of the ëEvil Empire’ gave strength and courage to the people fighting for freedom against Communist dictatorships,” and explains that “the idea of worker self-governmentóan effective instrument in the struggle against the communist _nomenklatura_ óturned out to be completely useless under the conditions of a market economy.”72

All too often today, debates on the left are not about how we can change society, but whether it is even possible or desirable to change it. In part, this is because of the political vacuum left by the collapse of Stalinism. The Communist Parties internationally attracted the best fighters in the working class, despite having politics that drove workers’ militancy into the dead end of Stalinism.

Rarely, if ever, has there been such a gap between the need for a revolutionary alternative and the level of organization of the left as exists today on an international level. Around the world, we see mounting evidence of the failures of capitalismómore misery, greater polarization of wealth and life expectations and wars that are claiming millions of lives. The economic crisis now affecting more than one-third of the world economy has exposed even more sharply the madness of a market system that means people go hungry because too many goods have been produced to sell profitably on the market.

Nowhere is this gap greater than in the former state capitalist countries, where many workers express the feeling that they have “tried socialism” and know that it didn’t work. With the resurgence of anti-Semitic, ultranationalist and Stalinist politicians taking advantage of popular disillusionment with the failure of the market to deliver for ordinary people, the need to provide an alternative that can explain why state capitalism was not socialism couldn’t be more urgent.

History “weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living,” Marx wrote in _The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Bonaparte_.73 The weight of Stalinism was massive. Chris Harman writes:

> One idea dominated the thinking of the left throughout the world for half a centuryóthe idea that socialist countries already existed. It is an idea which has...paralysed those who would fight for a better society. They have seen the so-called socialist countries reproduce all the evils of the capitalist society they were supposed to replace.

There have been economic crises driving millions to desperation (Poland), the wholesale sacking of workers and the formation of “reserve armies” of the unemployed (Yugoslavia and China), the use of tanks to conquer other peoples (Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Afghanistan), border wars between “socialist armies” (Russia and China, China and Vietnam), state incitement of anti-Semitism (Poland), the mass deployment of slave labour (Stalin’s Russia), even the establishment of extermination camps (Kampuchea [Cambodia]). The accumulation of wealth has continued to be accompanied by the accumulation of poverty, massive privileges by massive drudgery, the promise of liberation by the reality of repression.

For a whole generation the great majority of socialists in the West and the third world tried to ignore these realities. They tried to defend the indefensible, to hide from themselves what they could not hide from others, to cover up for their own uncertainty by empty rhetoric.

Even when the illusions in Russia died in the 1960s, a new generation frequently substituted illusions in China, Cuba, Vietnam or Kampuchea. But to no avail. Time and again real historical development caught them unawares, leaving them without arguments as successive leaders pointed to the crime of their predecessors, as the rulers of one “socialist” state poured abuse upon the rulers of another.74

The collapse of these illusions opened a new act in history, but it has not done away with the weight of the past. The Polish socialist Daniel Singer captures this contradiction in his new book, _Whose Millennium? Theirs or Ours?_

> We are at a moment, to borrow [Walt] Whitman’s words, when society “is for a while between things ended and things begun,” not because of some symbolic date on a calendar marking the turn of the millennium, but because the old order is a-dying, in so far as it can no longer provide answers corresponding to the social needs of our point of development, though it clings successfully to power, because there is no class, no social force ready to push it off the historical stage.75

Socialism from below

The events of 1989 provide a historic opportunity for socialists to reclaim the genuine tradition of socialism from belowóthe tradition of Karl Marx, Frederick Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, Lenin, Leon Trotsky and Antonio Gramsci.76

Around the world, workers are fighting against the devastating impact of the market on their lives. The collapse of Stalinism means that those workers can make their way to the only tradition capable of explaining the crisis of capitalism and the fall of Stalinism, and provide a real alternative: workers’ democratic control from below; production for human need, not profit; and international socialism.

The twentieth century has seen terrible crimes: the gulags of Stalin, the death camps of Hitler, the Vietnam War and Hiroshima and Nagasaki. All were expressions of capitalism.

But the twentieth century has also seen the massive growth of the force that can put an end to such barbarismóthe international working class, the group that has the power to end capitalism with its “classes and class antagonisms” and replace it with a society “in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.”
