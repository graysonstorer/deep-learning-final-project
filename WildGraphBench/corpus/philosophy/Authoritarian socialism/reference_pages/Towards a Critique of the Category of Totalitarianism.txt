Domenico Losurdo

Towards a Critique of the Category of Totalitarianism

A polysemous category

Already in 1951,when Hannah Arendt's The Origins of Totalitarianism was first pubUshed,the concept of totalitarianism had been debated for decades.And yet,the meaning of the term still lacks a proper definition.Is it possible to find a way through what appears to be a maze?In this article,I shall not examine the examples in which the adjective'totalitarian',even more than the noun that derives from it,bears a positive connotation.In other words,I shall not concentrate on the positive use of the term'totalitarian'with reference to the capacity,attributed to a religion or to any ideology or world view,to posit solutions to all of the many problems that arise from a dramatic situation,or even to answer the question of the meaning of life,a question that concerns humans in their totality.In 1958,though rejecting'legal totalitarianism',that is,totalitarianism imposed by the law,Karl Barth extolled the imiversalistic impulse and the all-encompassing effectiveness of the Christian'message':'The free grace of the Gospel,too,is"totalitarian",because it

aims at the whole,it demands all human beings,and demands each of them totally for itself'.^

Here,instead,I shall focus on the political debate.In Dialectic of Enlightenment,Horkheimer and Adorno hardly discuss the USSR.Besides dealing with the Third Reich,they analyse'totalitarian capitalism':

Previously only the poor and savages had been exposed to the untrammelled force of the capitalist elements.But the totalitarian order has granted unlimited rights to calculating thought and puts its trust in science as such.Its canon is its own brutal efficiency.^

Horkheimer and Adomo consider the stages that paved the way to Nazism to be not only the violence perpetrated by the great Western powers against the colonial peoples,but also the violence perpetrated,in the very heart of the capitalistic metropolis,against the poor and outcasts locked in the workhouses.Simone Weil,another author influenced to some extent by Marxism,held to a similar perspective.Though Weil occasionally compared Hitler's Germany to Stalin's Soviet Union,when she denounced the horror of total power,of totalitarianism,she referred primarily to colonialism and imperialism:'The similarity between Hitler's system and ancient Rome is so astounding that one is tempted to believe that,two thousand years later,only Hitler was able to faithfully copy the Romans'.^Between the Roman Empire and the Third Reich,we find Louis XIV's unbridled and unscrupulous expansionism:'The regime he established already deserved,for the first time in Europe after Rome,the modern epithet of totalitarian';'the dreadful destruction of the Palatinate[carried out by the French conquering troops]was not even justified by the circumstances of a war'.*Moving backwards from ancient Rome,Weil gave a proto-totalitarian interpretation to the biblical event of the conquest of Canaan and the annihilation of its people.

Consider some liberal thinkers.In tracing the genesis of'totalitarian democracy',Jacob Talmon comes to the following conclusion:

If...empiricism is the ally of freedom,and the doctrinaire spirit is the friend of totalitarianism,the idea of man as an abstraction,independent of the

historic groups to which he belongs,is likely to become a powerful vehicle of totalitarianism.'

Clearly,Talmon's targets are the Declaration of Human Rights and the French revolutionary tradition as a whole(not only Rousseau,but also Sieyes).

As for Hayek,'the tendencies that culminated in the creation of totalitarian systems are not confined to the countries that later succumbed to them',*"and they are not limited to the communist and Nazi-fascist movements.With regard to Austria in particular:

It was not the Fascists but the socialists who began to collect children from the tenderest age into political organisations to make sure that they grew up as good proletarians.It was not the Fascists but the socialists who first thought of organising sports and games,football and hiking,in party clubs where the members would not be infected by other views.It was the socialists who first insisted that the party member should distinguish himself from others by the modes of greeting and the forms of address.

Hayek can therefore conclude:The idea of a political party that encompasses all of the activities of an individual,from the cradle to the grave',and that radiates a general Weltanschauung,this idea is associated first of all with the socialist movement.^Behind this movement is a much older tradition that can be foimd,as Hayek-the father of neo-laissez-faire-will observe later on,in'"social"or totalitarian democracy'.^At any rate,'economic control and totalitarianism'are strictly connected.'

Therefore,if,on the one hand,colonialism and imperialism are the main(though not the exclusive)indicted phenomena,on the other hand,the principal(though not exclusive)target of the polemic is the revolutionary tradition that from 1789 leads to 1917,passing through the 1848 demand for the right to work and the'"social"or totalitarian democracy'.

At this point,a further distinction can be made.So-called'leftist'totalitarianism can be criticised from two quite different perspectives.It can either be regarded as the product of the unfortunate organicist ideology attributed to Marx,Rousseau,or even Sieyes(this is Talmon's and Hayek's
