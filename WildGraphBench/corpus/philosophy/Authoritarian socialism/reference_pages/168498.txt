Capitalism and freedom
======================

Authors: [Milton Friedman](https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=au=%22Friedman%2C%20Milton%22) (Author), [Rose D. Friedman](https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=au=%22Friedman%2C%20Rose%20D.%22) (Author)

Summary: In Capitalism and Freedom, economist Milton Friedman argues that political and economic freedom are inextricably linked, promoting laissez faire and individual choice over government intervention in markets through tariffs, subsidies and regulations. The book, along with Friedman's other writing, is credited with reviving conservative economic theory and influencing policies designed to decrease government spending following the Great Depression. In so doing, it put forth many ideas--for example, a flat income tax and school vouchers--that feature heavily in political discourse today
