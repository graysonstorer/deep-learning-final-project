Why the 'China Model' Isn't Going Away
======================================

From Bangkok to Caracas, Beijing's style of authoritarian capitalism is gaining influence.

Once considered an awkward, unsustainable blend of authoritarian politics and capitalist economics, China's growth "model" has shown impressive resilience in recent years. In this excerpt from his new book [_Democracy in Retreat_](http://www.amazon.com/Democracy-Retreat-Worldwide-Representative-Government/dp/0300175388), Joshua Kurlantzick explores why the "Beijing Consensus" has attracted so many admirers in recent years.

The attendees of the annual World Economic Forum in Davos are not exactly used to being told what to do. The Swiss resort draws the global elite: the highest-powered investment bankers, the top government officials and leaders, the biggest philanthropists, and the most famous celebrities, who gather each year to solve the world's most pressing problems and still have time for evening cocktails.
