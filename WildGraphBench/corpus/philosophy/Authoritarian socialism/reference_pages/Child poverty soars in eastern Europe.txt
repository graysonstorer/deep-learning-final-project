The study, from the European Children's Trust, says that hunger and poverty in the countries of the former Soviet Union are now at levels approaching those in the developing world. Within the region, the numbers of those living in poverty are more than 12 times what they were 10 years ago. The Trust, an international development organisation, warns that with winter approaching, the situation threatens to reach crisis proportions. **Millions below breadline** The Trust says more than 168 million people were living below the bread line in 1993 to 1995, the latest available figure. ![Image 3: Russian child](http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/965000/images/_966616_russ_girl150.jpg) Children have been hit hard by the crisis That's an increase from 14 million at the collapse of communism. The Trust believes the situation is now far worse. The proportion of the population living in poverty is as high as 88% in Kyrgyzstan and between 60 and 66% in Turkmenistan, Ukraine, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan and Moldova. **Children become 'orphans'** The report, called The Silent Crisis, highlights the plight of children. It warns that poverty is driving social breakdown with many families having to leave their children in state orphanages to ward off malnutrition. ![Image 4: Russian rouble](http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/965000/images/_966616_rouble150.jpg) Russia suffered economic meltdown in 1998 The Trust says a crisis has been building since the old communist system disappeared. It claims a sudden relaxation of price controls, coupled with widespread privatisation of industry produced economic meltdown. Production fell, inflation soared and the safety nets provided by the old regime simply evaporated. The Trust suggests that rather than direct aid, the West should help the expansion of services preventing family breakdown.![Image 5: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/nothing.gif)![Image 6: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/nothing.gif) ![Image 7: Launch console](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/launch_console_button.gif) ![Image 8: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/greydark_pixel.gif) ![Image 9: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/nothing.gif) ![Image 10: A 12x9 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/audio.gif)**[![Image 11: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/nothing.gif)BBC RADIO NEWS](http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/cta/progs/rn/bulletin.ram)** ![Image 12: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/greydark_pixel.gif) ![Image 13: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/nothing.gif) ![Image 14: A 12x8 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/video.gif)**[![Image 15: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/nothing.gif)BBC ONE TV NEWS](http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/video/news169.ram)** ![Image 16: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/greydark_pixel.gif) ![Image 17: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/nothing.gif) ![Image 18: A 12x9 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/audio.gif)**[![Image 19: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/nothing.gif)WORLD NEWS SUMMARY](http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/news/summary.ram)** ![Image 20: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/greydark_pixel.gif) ![Image 21: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/nothing.gif) ![Image 22: A 12x8 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/video.gif)**[![Image 23: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/nothing.gif)BBC NEWS 24 BULLETIN](http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/cta/n24.ram)** ![Image 24: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/greydark_pixel.gif) ![Image 25: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/nothing.gif)![Image 26: A 5x12 small image, likely a logo, icon or avatar](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/aro_blue_sm.gif)![Image 27: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/nothing.gif)**[![Image 28: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/nothing.gif)PROGRAMMES GUIDE](http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/audiovideo/programmes/default.stm)** **See also:** ![Image 29: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/grey_pixel.gif) **Internet links:** ![Image 30: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/furniture/grey_pixel.gif) The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites **Top Business stories now:** ![Image 31: A 170x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport/furniture/grey_pixel.gif) ![Image 32: A 170x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport/furniture/grey_pixel.gif) Links to more Business stories are at the foot of the page. ![Image 33: A 170x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport/furniture/grey_pixel.gif)
