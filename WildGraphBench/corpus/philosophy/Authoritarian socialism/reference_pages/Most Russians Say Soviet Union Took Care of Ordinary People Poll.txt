A majority of Russians believe that the Soviet system took care of the common man and woman, according to a recent poll by the independent Levada Center pollster.

Russia has seen an upward trend in positive opinions about the Soviet Union in recent years, with nostalgia toward it [hitting](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2018/12/19/nostalgia-for-soviet-union-hits-14-year-high-russia-poll-says-a63884) a 14-year high in December. Public approval of Stalin’s role in the country’s history [reached](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2019/04/16/stalins-approval-rating-among-russians-hits-record-high-poll-a65245) record levels this spring.

Fifty-nine percent of Russian respondents said “the state took care of ordinary people” when asked to name the defining characteristics of Soviet rule, according to Levada’s results [published](https://www.levada.ru/2019/06/24/chernovik/) Monday.

The absence of ethnic conflicts (46 percent) as well as economic growth and lack of unemployment (43 percent) were the second and third-most common responses, Levada said. Constantly improving living conditions (39 percent) and advancements in science and culture (31 percent) placed fourth and fifth in Russians’ ranking of Soviet life.

All five of the responses suggesting an increasingly favorable view of Soviet rule saw a marked increase (by as much as 30 percentage points) from the last two times that Levada had asked the question in 2000 and 2008.

At the same time, fewer respondents identified Soviet life with longer lines in stores, international isolation and the persecution of dissidents than they did in past polls.

The “idealization” of the Soviet past does not imply that Russians would prefer to live in the Soviet Union, Levada sociologist Karina Pipiya said.

“All that the U.S.S.R. is now glorified for is largely a consequence of what Russians are unhappy with now: low income, inequality and corruption,” she [wrote](https://www.vedomosti.ru/opinion/articles/2019/06/23/804841-prostoi-paternalizm?utm_source=yxnews&utm_medium=desktop) in an op-ed for the Vedomosti business daily.

Respondents were given 14 possible responses to rank as the defining traits of Soviet life, including poverty, the Communist Party’s guiding role and military spending.

Levada conducted the survey among 1,616 respondents in 50 Russian regions on May 24-29.

**A Message from The Moscow Times:**

Dear readers,

We are facing unprecedented challenges. Russia's Prosecutor General's Office has designated The Moscow Times as an "undesirable" organization, criminalizing our work and putting our staff at risk of prosecution. This follows our earlier unjust labeling as a "foreign agent."

These actions are direct attempts to silence independent journalism in Russia. The authorities claim our work "discredits the decisions of the Russian leadership." We see things differently: we strive to provide accurate, unbiased reporting on Russia.

We, the journalists of The Moscow Times, refuse to be silenced. But to continue our work, [we need your help](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/contribute?utm_source=contribute&utm_medium=article "we need your help").

Your support, no matter how small, makes a world of difference. If you can, please support us monthly starting from just $2. It's quick to set up, and every contribution makes a significant impact.

By supporting The Moscow Times, you're defending open, independent journalism in the face of repression. Thank you for standing with us.
