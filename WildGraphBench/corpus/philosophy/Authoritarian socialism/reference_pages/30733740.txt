The road to serfdom
===================

Author: [Friedrich A. von Hayek](https://search.worldcat.org/search?q=au=%22Hayek%2C%20Friedrich%20A.%20von%22)

Summary: A classic work in political philosophy, intellectual and cultural history, and economics, The Road to Serfdom has inspired and infuriated politicians, scholars, and general readers for half a century. Originally published in England in the spring of 1944 - when the Labour party ruled in Britain, Eleanor Roosevelt supported the efforts of Stalin, and Albert Einstein subscribed to the socialist program - The Road to Serfdom was seen as heretical for its passionate warning against the dangers of state control over the means of production. For F.A. Hayek, the collectivist idea of empowering government with increasing economic control would inevitably lead not to a utopia but to the horrors of Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy
