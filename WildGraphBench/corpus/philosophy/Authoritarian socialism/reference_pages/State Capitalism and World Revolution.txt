# FULLY AND ABSOLUTELY ASSURED 

Thirty years ago those who adhered to revolutionary Marxism or who thought about it were in ferment. Dominating the discussion were the views of Trotsky, who was universally looked upon as continuing the Marx, Engels and Lenin tradi tion. In fact Trotsky's name was used most often in associa tion with Lenin. Lenin and Trotsky summed up the official Marxist position of the day. The importance of State Capitalism and World Revolu tion, published in 1950, was that it not only projected atheory of state capitalism, but at its very beginning it stated definitely and unequivocally that Trotsky's whole method of analysis and results were to be repudiated. As I look back at the appearance of this document and those days, I am fre quently reminded of the fact that some of the people in the United States who read it were not so much impressed at the beginning with the theory of state capitalism: They were startled and, in fact, bewildered at the fact that I had challenged directly the Marxist ipeas of Lenin and Trotsky (as they thought it)-the Trotsky who had led the October Revolution to victory. The power of the Johnson-Forest Tendency which led them to challenge with such effrontery the leader of the Third Inter national and the initiator of the Fourth, was the last writings of Lenin. Today, thirty years after this document State Capitalism and World Revolution was produced, the writings of Lenin, particularly in his last days, still remain the founda tion of any attempt to observe, to organize, to assist in any 

vii way the movement towards Marxism-that is to say towards the emancipation of the working class. That last phrase sounds awkward in my ears today. Today I do not know of any body of people who speak or preach with any confidence of the "emancipation of the working class." People are not against, not at all-but they are not  

> for.

Political thought in relation to society at this most critical period in human history is in a state of suspended animation. That is not quite true. There is no animation, but there is not stagnation. There is a conscious desire to wait and see. In Poland in 1981 the working class and the people of Poland registered the first basis of the new conception of the emancipation of the working class. The people of Poland formed a socialist party-but this was a party to end all parties. It consisted of ten million Polish people. In fact the able bodied people of Poland, the men and women, formed a party which did not represent the people, but itself consisted of the people. The people were the party and the party was the people. I do not think that I should go in here to the ideas which are sufficiently expounded and bear up against all the prob lems of the day, in the document State Capitalism and World Revolution. However, for me Marxism is itself the movement of history and I cannot do better than to make clear that what the reader will find in this document is a restatement in con temporary terms of Lenin's most profound reflections in 1923 as he knew he was dying and wanted to leave the heritage of the experience to the party, the Russian people and the world revolution. The articles which really matter are-On Cooperation (January 4th 1923), again On Coopera tion (January 6th 1923), How We Should Reorganize the Workers' and Peasants' Inspection (January 23rd 1923) and   

> Better Fewer, But Better

(March 2nd 1923). I think he was unable to write part of these last articles and had to dictate them. I wish to say only that in those articles he condemned 

viii 

absolutely, in language I have not seen or heard anywhere else, the U.S.S.R. The historical parallel that he made was a bureaucratic organization of society with the mass of the population as serfs that had not yet reached the feudal system in its maturity. I want to correct or, strictly speaking, indulge myself and state some of the terms he used-pre-feudal for the state and  

> bureaucratic-serf

culture for the people. I may appear to be militant to the point of ferocity. I am because these most important writings, the summation of the greatest political experience the world has ever had, the formation of the Bolshevik Party and the creation of the first Workers' State-this summation is entirely neglected and, I am now convinced, not by any chance. My experience is the people on the left and generally anti-capitalist, are afraid of it. I shall now conclude by stating what they are afraid of. Here is Lenin's summation that he entitles Explanatory Notes: 

"The Soviets are a new state apparatus, which, in the first place, provides an armed force of workers and peasants; and this force is not divorced from the people, as was the old stan ding army, but is fused with the people in the closest possible fashion. From a military point of view, this force is incom parably more powerful than previous forces; from the point of view of the revolution it cannot be replaced by anything else. "Secondly, this apparatus provides a bond with the masses, with the majority of the people, so intimate, so in dissoluble, so readily contollable and renewable, that there was nothing remotely like it in the previous state apparatus. "Thirdly, this apparatus, by virtue of the fact that it is elected and subject to recall at the will of the people without any bureaucratic formalities, is far more democratic than any previous apparatus. "Fourthly, it provides a close contact with the most diverse occupations, thus facilitating the adoption of the most varied 

ix and most radical reforms without a bureaucracy, "Fifthly, it provides a form of organization of the vanguard, i.e., of the most class-conscious, most energetic and most progressive section of the oppressed classes, the workers and peasants, and thus constitutes an apparatus with the help of which the vanguard of the oppressed classes can elevate, educate and lead the gigantic masses of these classes, which hitherto have stood remote from political life and from history. "Sixthly, it provides the possibility of combining the ad vantages of parliamentarism with the advantages of im mediate and direct democracy, i.e., of uniting in the persons of the elected representatives of the people both legislative and executive functions. Compared with bourgeois parliamentarism, this represents an advance in the develop ment of democracy which is of historical and worldwide significance. " (V. I. Lenin, Selected Works, Vol. VIII, p. 454.) 

There is one aspect of Lenin which cannot be omitted in what I believe was the very last article, Better Fewer, But Better 

(March 2nd 1923). Near the end, after outlining the prospects of the world revolution, he concludes: "In the last analysis, the outcome of the struggle will be determined by the fact that Russia, India, China, etc., ac count for the overwhelming majority of the population of the globe. And during the past few years it is this majority that has been drawn into the struggle for emancipation with ex traordinary rapidity, so that in this respect there cannot be the slightest doubt what the final outcome of the world strug gle will be. In this sense, the complete victory of socialism is fully and absolutely assured. "

# INTRODUCTION 

Two generations ago, C. L. R. James and a small circle of col laborators set forth a revolutionary critique of industrial civiliza tion. Their vision possessed a striking originality. So insular was the political context of their theoretical breakthroughs, however, and so thoroughly did their optimistic expectations for working class activity defy trends away from class and social issues to the so called "End of Ideology," that the documents of the signal effort never reached public view. Happily, times have changed. James has become a late-life celebrity, near-legendary eminence grise of Pan-Africanism, admired cultural critic. The corpus of his theoretical work is available in three volumes of selected essays, a philosophical work,    

> Notes on Dialectics,

and his major work of literary criticism,     

> Mariners, Renegades and Castaways.

Readers have discovered much, even after all these years, to challenge Marxist (or any other) orthodoxy. They will never find a more succinct version of James' general conclusions than State Capitalism and World Revolution. I

In this slim volume, James and his comrades successfully predict the future course of Marxism. Contrary to reigning Old Left dogmas, they argue that workers on both sides of the Iron Curtain and under any variety of state or private ownership face the same essential contradictions. The drive for ever-expanding productivity disguises a mad rationalism, unable any longer to reconcile its aim of total control with the technological means at hand. This sorcerer's apprentice recognizes no democratic, human solution. Socialists, Communists and Trotskyists alike-themselves heir to the ideology of economic fatalism and political elites-tragically share the same blindspot. The old forms of workingclass expres sion, such as Left or labor parties, unions and state ownership of production, have become part of the logic of continued capitalist development. New forms of mass self-expression must arise against these bureaucratized institutions and against the assumptions they 

xi harbor. Radicals who fail to heed these warnings, to aid the newer developments, betray their own best instincts and the best tradi tions of Marxism. The insight expressed here takes us from the world of Trotsky, Stalin and Norman Thomas to the world of New Left. Black Power and Polish Solidarity. But the form of argumentation in State Capitalism and World Revolution threatens to obscure the actual breakthrough from the casual reader. As James would recall in his autobiographical notes, "the thing that mattered chiefly was the correct political line that had enabled Lenin to defeat all his rivals and to lead the Russian Revolution to success." If this project had been, in retrospect, "a complete illusion," then "we believed in it completely and were able to examine it and find the weaknesses that were in it."2 From the first lines of the original introduction, the text bristles with manifestations of the immanent critique, attacks on Trotskyist groups and on perspectives unknown outside the small movement. State Capitalism and World Revolution must be seen as an exercise in self-clarity or it will not likely be seen at all. Even the omissions we would now regard as major take on a distinct meaning in this light. The book seems oblivious to ethnicity and religion, always central to workingclass life, and even to race, an area where James had previously made fundamental contribu tions. Atomic armament and the struggle against it, the "Woman Question" that had re-emerged sharply during the Second World War and would shortly become a central theoretical issue for James' group-these issues, too, were put aside. Culture, the keynote of social movements since the early 19608, can hardly be found at all. An almost syndicalist intensity on the shop-floor struggle and its implications crowds out these other issues. Only the workers, their essential similarity and potential world-wide links, come fully into view. And that is surely the point. James had to narrow the focus so that the outlines would become clear. The careful reader will also find a "hidden text" straining to escape the straitjacket of formal political discourse. James and his circle wished to restore the revolutionary continuity of Hegel, the young Marx and the aging Lenin not only for the sake of political strategy, but to recover a conception practically lost since the First International. The founding father of Marxism premised his vision of Socialism upon the abolition of the growing dichotomy between mental and manual labor, a dichotomy which mutilated the worker's natural creativity and which rendered the intellectual an 

xii 

isolate. Lenin, the political chief of a n unwanted bureaucratic state apparatus, staged his final struggle to create the basis for direct economic democracy. On anything less than a world scale, the con tradictions could not (and cannot) be finally overcome. The age of dictators in the political Kremlins, military Pentagons and state planning bureaus or corporate headquarters had, by the 1940s, seemingly vanquished humanity's best hopes, and relegated "Socialism" to varieties of state regulation. State Capitalism and World Revolution insists, rather, that the very heightening of inter nal antagonisms and catastrophic possibilities means the real end of class society may be closer than the radicals themselves realize. Or dinary people have been prepared by their own uniquely modern experiences, good and bad. Now only the opportunity for the full use of their collective genius is lacking. Couched in the language of political warfare, State Capitalism and World Revolution is agospel of hope. However unrealized that hope thirty-five years later, it remains the alternative to the spread of gulags and blood baths, and to the fast-approaching Doomsday. 

* * *

C.L.R. James' first "American Years," 1938-53, of which this book offers the foremost political evidence, can be seen best as a slice of life surrounded by what had gone before and what has followed. At 31, in 1932, James left his native Trinidad to explore the sources of his British colonial legacy. In the following six years, he managed to become cricket correspondent for the Manchester Guardian, a prominent Trotskyist writer and orator, a pioneer of African emancipation and an author of several important books, including the classic history Black Jacobins and a Trotskyist "bi ble" of Comintern history, World Revolution. He then exited for America, where he made his home for fifteen years, until his depor tation in 1953 (nominally" for a passport violation, but in reality because of his political status). Since then James has lived for periods in England, the Caribbean and (after 1970) again in the United States. He has served, into old age, as vigorous radical social theorist, dynamic lecturer, political influence and at times political leader on several continents. 3

Only in the first American years, however. 1 did James lead a political group for a sustained period, and set out with others to solve, collectively, the puzzle of Marxism's legacy for the late twen-

x iii tieth century. Illuminating this heretofore little-known period of his life offers a way to understand otherwise curious aspects of  

> State Capitalism and World Revolution.

The story begins in Coyoacan, Mexico, with James' spirited dialogue with Leon Trotsky. Supported by small if energetic groups, outmaneuvered by the Popular Front coalition which threw vast liberal and social-democratic influences behind Moscow's anti-fascist policies, Trotsky gamely outlined his plans for a revolutionary breakthrough. James presented a new element in the equation. Virtually Trotskyism's only internationally-known Third World figure, James had proved himself in Britain, but as political ally more than disciple. Indeed, James' intellectual and political methods, his wide range of associates in non-political and even Communist milieux, had already disturbed British Trotskyist orthodoxy. He would in America shortly join a crusade against Trotsky's leadership and later turn against Trotskyism altogether. The discussion pitted the two remarkable figures as equals-perhaps to Trotsky's surprise. The obvious bone of con tention lay in the "Negro Question" and its larger significance. Trotsky argued in good Bolshevik fashion that blacks would be brought into the Trotskyist party (or into Trotskyist-led mass movements), taught proper politics, and directed the way the Bolsheviks had directed national minorities within and alongside Russian borders. James disputed the contention. Blacks, he in sisted, did not need to be led by the labor movement or anyone else. They could be significantly aided by revolutionary thinkers and ac tivists, but rather than socialist politics freeing blacks, blacks would themselves precipitate the radical movement in the United States, creating a mass force led by blacks struggling for their democratic rights: Too much might be made of this particular argument. The great exile gave ground, while most Trotskyists remained fixed in their task of organizing disciplined parties to the exclusion of almost everything else. Trotsky and James shared, after all, a concrete ex perience in the international arena where political mobilization assumed a variety of different forms. ' Like the lesser Trotskyists, the two identified the Russian Revolution as the key event of the century and the formation of strong national organizations as chief means to resurrect true internationalism. But James venerated a different Lenin, perhaps, than Trotsky or the Trotskyists. His was a 

xiv 

prophet of colonial revolution by people of color, people whose cir cumstances practically excluded the kind of straightforward pro letarian party typical of Europe and much desired in the U.S. Im plicit in the distinction was also James' confidence in the rural workers on whose backs capitalism accrued its first "primitive ac cumulation." Their appearance on the stage of history, in their own name, marked not only an economic-social but also a cultural 

turning point in revolutionary possibilities. "Trotsky declared that the proletariat does not grow under world capitalism and declines in culture. This is absolutely false," James would write in 1950. What he had observed on the cricket fields and calypso tents, he quickly appreciated in Afro-American culture from church rituals to the Cotton Club. The confluence of former ly rural cultures into the industrial-urban proletariat supplied a key to the enigma-although James would not yet phrase it this way-which found Euro-American Marxism at a loss since the First World War and the isolation of the Russian experiment. 6

James wholeheartedly agreed with Trotsky's goal of forging an "American Bolshevism," but sought a Bolshevism the Trotskyists never anticipated. At Coyoacan, James asked Trotsky why Euro pean Trotskyist groups could actually stagnate at a time of rising European labor struggles. He viewed Trotsky's defense of the vanguard party's "ultimate" triumph with considerable skep ticism. This disagreement went to the heart of things. The disproportion of Trotskyist vanguard claims and actual influence defied credulity. In other parts of the world where Communists assumed control of the anti-fascist partisan military forces, their organizations would indeed come to power (purging their radical, democratic critics in the process). But in the unconquered nations and most clearly the United States, the Marxist political pa rties in their classic form and with their political rather than military aims had by the late 1930s reached the apex of their influence, a rarefied altitude from which descent would be both swift and permanent. James' observation of American life reinforced this understanding. The self-possession of the ordinary American struck him as almost unbelievable. "Every American citizen, ignorant of so many things that his European counterpart knows, is conscious of himself as a distinct personality, in his own opinion and the opinion of his fellows, as entitled to special consideration of his ideas, his feelings, his likes and dislikes as the most aristocratic heroine of a European 

xv novel," James would say in Mariners, Renegades and Castaways. 

But this advance was not painless. Quite to the contrary, for "at the same time, he is consumed by the need of intimate communion with his fellows.'" Liberation from the weight of the past which holds back Europeans, impels Americans to become free-to grapple urgently for social relations which can turn the universal sense of desperation into an integrated modern self. That could be achieved only by social transformation of a scale and quality considered a distant successor to proletarian revolution by nineteenth century Marxists. Such a view of Socialism, sophisticated even now, was in the 19308-40s rare indeed. Similar notions advanced by the anarcho mystic Gustav Landauer or Lenin's "Ultra-Left" opponent, Dutch poet Herman Gorter, had been outside the main currents of the Left. Some cultural movements, Surrealism in particular, sought to return questions of consciousness and individual transformation to the center of the revolutionary stage; but these were isolated by the success of Communist machinations and by the shroud of pessimism held above the 1930s movement after the Nazi seizure of power. 8 In the United States, cultural questions remained the province of intellectuals, save in the restricted foreign-language circles of autodidact workers. Actual factory-based movements largely continued an old-fashioned belief in economism, anticipating that the victory of "rational" socialism over "irrational" capitalism would bring automatic solutions to all remaining social problems. James readily appreciated his exceptional point of observation within American society and sought to make the most of his oppor tunity for a fresh view free of the familiar Leftist blinders. While taking part in the Trotskyist movement, as lecturer and organizer of Missouri sharecroppers and factional wrangler, he also led aseparate and almost "unpolitical" existence. He lived near Harlem and held discussions with intellectuals ranging from Richard Wright to Theodor Adorno. He gulped down American literature, not excepting the "reactionary" Poe and Faulkner. And he struck many of his political associates not only as a brilliant and encyclopedic Marxist thinker but also as an extreme eccentric. Future luminaries from the same circle, such as Irving Howe or Hal Draper, seemed genuinely baffled by his charismatic appeal and by his heterodox views. Others regarded him as mystic, crypto anarchist or black nationalist! 

xvi 

Probably only a small circle could accept perspectives s o radically out of kilter with existing doctrines. As James tells the story, the break of a Trotskyist faction with Trotsky himself in 1940 over their unwillingness to support Russia in the coming world war unleashed a profound sense of discontinuity in Marxist tradition. James Burnham, perhaps the most prominent intellectual besides C.L.R. James in the group, unleashed a blistering polemic against dialectical materialism as outdated nonsense disregarded by all serious scientific thought. The faction's main leader, Max Shachtman, propounded a theory of Russian social dynamics which seemed to place the new bureaucratic system outside the Marxist analysis o f class contradictions. The roof seemed t o b e caving in from several directions at one. (Nor was this a misperception. Burnham was by the late 1940s, the foremost intellectual advocate for military con frontation with the Soviet Union, and Shachtman the policy ar chitect of later AFL-CIO support for the Vietnam War.) James himself wondered if he should return to Britain. The singular Raya Dunayevskaya, Russian-born intellectual and secretary to Trotsky, persuaded James to stay, in order to begin the collective effort required to renew the basis of Marxist thought . Fluent in Russian, she had already determined that everything Lenin wrote about Marxism, especially his analysis of capitalist production and his commentaries on Marx's relevant interpreta tions, should be translated and circulated for discussion. Grace Lee, daughter of a prominent Asian-American restaurateur and herself a philosophy PhD, made the pair a trio with her work on German-language materials. (Strange as it now seems, the first English translations from Marx's 1844 Economic-Philosophical Manuscripts were mimeographed by James' group for discussions with Detroit auto workers.) James supplied the world-view and literary skills for the collective tasks. Around the three grew afollowing which numbered at its peak around seventy, including union militants, a few black activists, and a direct descendent of Tom Paine. I. 

Only in recent years have historians taken seriously the levels of contemporary discontent which gave James' group spheres of ac tual influence and reasons to hope for dramatic social change. War time strikers rebelled at once against union leadership, government and employers. In the several years immediately following Allied victory, industrialists sought to recoup concessions made to workers since the late 1930s, while newer members of the industrial 

xvii workforce (removed southerners, especially blacks, and women re taining their jobs) along with the returned GIs demanded a piece of the better world they had been promised for past sacrifices. City general strikes and industry-wide actions crossed jurisdictional lines and inspired a blue-collar camaraderie unknown since the sit down days-but this time frequently critical of unions themselves. Small business and no few labor leaders responded with panic. The Republican Congress and the Truman administration seized the op portunity afforded by the Cold War to blame the unrest (altogether undeservedly) on the Communists and to enact new measures, most notably the Taft-Hartley Act, limiting labor activism. Militant labor suffered a defeat whose sorry consequences remain to this day. But even the pulsating frustration, disappointment and unrealized aspirations fed a creative outburst of popular music, sports and film. The nation seemed to pause between the utopian anti-Nazi zeal slipping away and the social stasis, urban flight and consumer craving of the 19508,11 Such counter-institutional militancy, and the absence of aSocialist or Communist party on a European scale, gave James' political innovations a special urgency. Time was running out. The paucity of actual Trotskyists, however, may in retl:ospect raise questions about James' contemporary optimism. I once frankly asked him how he thought a movement of several hundred could expect to change a country of a hundred million. Behind the famous Marxist confidence in historical logic, behind the infamous Trotskyist grouplet striving for the correct political position. might be found an intellectual's resolve. His many intellectual friends of the time shared James' political conclusions domestic and interna tional but felt helpless, isolated, impotent. The atomic annihilation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the full reports of the Holocaust, deepened the sense of paralysis. The cultivated Jewish sensitivity which balanced proletarian-revolutionary commitment with love for Toscanini and fascination with psychoanalysis had been the Shachtman group's existential raison d'etre. Now, as the promised political breakthrough for the group failed to appear, and so much of the world situation appeared bleak, the collective will gave way. Years before the group shriveled in size and its foremost leaders turned sharply to the right, pessimism suffused the cadres. James' circle had an almost unique sense of actual optimism within or outside the Shachtman group. Unlike Communists or liberals, the "Johnson-Forest Tendency" based its hopes not on 

xviii 

Allied victory and post-war Russo-American cooperation in a state regulated world order. but rather in the instinctive rebellion against that order. Unlike the Shachtmanites (or their opposing twin, the Socialist Workers Party led by James P. Cannon), they believed the possibilities of mass mobilization had drastically altered the revolu tionaries' own role. The group first proposed to convert the rest of the Troskyists to its evolving position. James insisted the Workers' Party "recognize its function as a group making propaganda for revolutionary action to the masses," i.e., leap over the anticipated party-building stage almost entirely. When other leaders pointed to the political and cultural "backwardness" of American labor as proof of the need for an educational-organizational interregnum before the decisive battle with capitalism, James brought forward his own pro gnostications. Lenin, James argued, had late in life repudiated the instrumental elitism of What Is To Be Done?, the dogma that only the revolutionary could educate workers. The great Bolshevik leader saw correctly that the strategic position of Russian workers in the economy and urban society thrust them into a pivotal role regardless of other factors. Moreover, James added, the Ameri �an proletariat had other special sources of strength. The socml democratic reformism dominant in Western Europe, the European Communist Parties' restraint on workers, had no strength here. As so frequently in our brutal industrial history, American class forces faced off against each other virtually unmediated. "The American proletariat," James concluded, "is literally revolting against the very conditions of production itself." 12 Among a series of documents outlining the "Johnson-F�rest Tendency" perspectives, The Invading Socialist Society, publIshed in 1947 just as the group prepared entry into the Socialist Workers Party, provides the decisive break with the older positions and foreshadows State Cap,italism and World Revolution. Here, James argued for the first tim � that Communist parties were not essentially "tools of the Kremlin" as Trotskyist orthodoxists claimed, but rather "an organic product of the mode of capitalism at this stage." Seen in that way, a new objective layer of intelligentsia and union leadership disillusioned with private capitalism but unable to see workers' capacity for self-rule could be understood as a result of historical dialectics. Stalinism ceased to be viewed as a grotesque and ultimately inexplicable distortion of the revolutionary process. To the contrary, it had to be a "necessary and inevitable form of 

xix development of the labor movement. " James refused to be drawn into the blanket anti-communism which singled out Russia as the main enemy to progress and its American supporters as the main opponents that Trotskyists had to overcome. He perceived the similarity in Communist and Trotskyist supporters of various bureaucratic tendencies, and he drew a strategic conclusion: "It is the task of the Fourth International to drive as clear a line between bourgeois nationalization and proletarian nationalization as the revolutionary Third International drive between bourgeois democracy and proletarian democracy. " 13 James had only to detach the goal from the Trotskyist means.  

> State Capitalism and World Revolution

may itself be regarded as a step toward the philosophical conclusion spelled out in Facing Reality, written with Grace Lee and published in 1958 when James had already gone into exile. There, James took positive cognizance of the American black movement, the nationalist revolutions in Asia and Africa, and above all the Hungarian Revolution of 1956. These had begun to carry out, albeit in different ways, the hopes expressed in his Trotskyist years. He also drew moral conclusions that the strictures of Trotskyism had not allowed. He judged the arms race, the stifling official culture and the ethical bankruptcy of East and West alike as decisive proof that' 'Official society is not in decline. As civilization, as culture, as reason, as morals, it is already dead." 14 The reader can judge, in the following text, how far James had already gone along the road to this larger view in 1950. State Capitalism and World Revolution is also the last of James' texts to be set in the classic Marxist-Leninist strategic framework. Facing Reality seemed to many a de facto anarchism, the authors' disclaimers notwithstanding. Sheared away from the last of the vanguard moorings, the revolutionary group had lost its cadre-building mission b�tween the waves of radical upsurge; its political role became uncertain. Here, in a concrete political sense, James' group foreshadowed the successes and limitations of the New Left. It could publish a newspaper remarkably lively and optimistic for its day (the early 1950s), seize upon the implications of phenomena (wildcat strikes or the first stirrings of Black Power in the unions) better than the doctrine-ridden Left, and encourage young people with its wide-ranging belief in human creativity. It could not so easily maintain, or even justify its own separate ex istence. James himself was wont to say that the group through its various emanations, from its official abandonment of Trotskyism 

xx 

in 1950 to its formal dissolution in 1970, knew what it was moving away from but not so clearly what it was going toward. James had completed a philosophical journey, had seen more clearly than any other political thinker of the older generation the fresh phase of organization and attitude up ahead-but at a cost. l' State Capitalism and World Revolution told the Old Left what it did not want to hear, and spoke to the rising New Left in a voice that it could not clearly understand. Now, in the 1980s, circumstances have once again shifted, and this time favorably for the forgotten text. More massively, more completely than the 1956 Hungarian Revolution or the 1968 French revolt, Polish Solidarity has truly vindicated James. Concurrently, the most drastic reduction of workers' living standards since the late nineteenth century has brought class issues (if not their solu tion) home to Europeans and Americans. We live in a world where the revolutionary chiliasm of bleeding Latin America and the collapse of labor officialdom at the imperial centers have become inextricably intertwined, the distance between the "utopian" wish for total change and the action required by survival now reduced to a thin edge of stubborn reality.l. James has had a way of seeing the faces of the crowd behind the glamour and horror of the economic-political spectacle. No wonder social historians as a group have been the quickest to appreciate the significance of his contribution. The meta-theory of State Capitalism and World Revolution has been the most difficult aspect of his legacy to apprehend and assimilate, perhaps, because the human basis of all social forces remains most hidden. All the same, the reader will find that the text's inner meaning peeps out above the nearly forty years' distance from its original publication, and above all the difficulties of context and language. The proof lies in Chapter XI. State Capitalism and World Revolution ends, save for two pages, with a universal perception. Treatises have been written by quantum physicists, testaments delivered by Native American seers, warnings proclaimed by poets and natural scientists against the calamity that the mechanist perception of the universe has caused in our environment and in our way of understanding life. We can see far better now than in 1950 how the Western conception of conquering Nature is related to an attitude about the use of human beings as mere functions of production and consumption. Every day we count the toll in moun ting cancer cases and the devastation of some natural setting or 

xxi species of flora or fauna eons in creation. We seem to have reserved a prime spot for ourselves in the list of future extinctions. All of James cried out against this worldview when it still held Marxism firmly in its grip. I? Behind his dialectical critique-not denial of Marxism's and Bolshevism's limitations but transcendence which retains the best ?f tradition-thrives a personal insight both unique and universally human, characteristic not only of James but of his whole political circle. Let him tell a story about the origins of that insight, from the pages of his unpublished autobiography: "I remember my first break with the philosophy of rationalism. It was Bergson, 1934. His work had come at the turn of the century. And was startling to me on two counts . 1) He attacked the abstrac tions of Understanding, their mechanical categorization, etc . , and opposed to this, Intuition. 2) Humor, he said, was the fulfillment of the desire to see the snob and aristocrat humbled. So that the well-dressed man slipping on a banana peel was his classic example of humor. It is still individualistic, as it would be in this philosopher, but I remember it broke me with morbid and melan choly philosophy speculation . . . . " IS

xxiii PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION (1968) 

When the second edition of State Capitalism and World Revolu tion was at the printer, the Hungarian Revolution exploded. It could only be acknowledged in a few paragraphs on the cover. Now, while this third edition is being prepared, the totality of what was put forward in this document is revealed in the revolutionary struggles of French workers and students. These struggles are not over as this is being written. In the years since the second edition of State Capitalism and World Revolution was published in England much of what was contained in this document has been accepted by a wider public. What was first said here in 1950 became visible to many after the thaw in the Cold War and the increase in travel and communication between the nations of the West and of the East. The characteristics which the Soviet Union shared with all capitalist countries could be seen directly. It no longer had to be culled from statistical analyses or from reading between the lines of speeches to congresses of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Yet this work is not only not out of date, it is more valuable than ever. For its significance has only incidentally been its accurate description of Russian and western European society. The impor tance of this book is that it refined and brought up to date the theory of Marxism and made it directly applicable to our own time. What is most often overlooked by those who accept entirely or in part the conception that the Soviet Union and its related states are fundamentally capitalist is that this analysis is an analysis of capitalist society, not Russian society. The conclusions flowing from this analysis have the greatest relevance in understanding the United States as well as the Soviet Union, Great Britain as well as Poland, France as well as China, and, of course, the working class of all these countries. Capitalism is an international society and the working class is a class that transcends national borders. Marx's description of nineteenth century England did not describe nine teenth century France or Germany. But the conclusions which 

xxiv 

Marx drew from his study of Great Britain were applicable everywhere. In Chapter V, The Class Struggle, "The Mode of Labor in the United States" is set down side by side with "The Mode of Labor in Russia." The specific form of class relations in Russia led to Vorkuta to the German revolt of 1953, to the Polish and Hungari � Revolutions and to the Workers' Councils as the new form of the workers' struggles. But that form is as international as the Commune was in 1871, as Soviets were in 1905 and 1917. Not in detail but in essence-otherwise-all theory is nonsense or theory becomes a universal theory of national exceptionalism. For the last twelve years the Hungarian Revolution has been evidence of the concrete stage of the struggle for socialism. It had established in life what could only be established in the abstractness of theory before. It began with the total destruction of the vanguard party as any kind of revolutionary instrument. It in dicated how far in advance of 1917 the world of the 1950s was. An educated modern working class did not require indirect methods of repre �entation. In the Workers' Councils it cr �ated the . in struments of direct democracy, what has been called 10 the UnIted States, participatory democracy. This, of course, has nothing in common with the "participation" of De Gaulle or the workers' councils of Tito, both of which are designed so that workers can participate in their own exploitation. The Hungarian worki �g class did not require separate instruments to control other sections of society. Farmers, office-workers, technicians, . civil servants-a,I Icreated their own equivalent of workers' councils to manage their own affairs in the name of the revolution as a whole. Instead of workers or students taking over such strategic instruments as radio stations and newspapers, the staffs of these institutions made their own revolution. Only in the totality of the Hungarian Revolution does much of what has been happening in the United States in the years since 1956 become clear. The refusal of the black liberation movement to confine itself to the limits of a single traditional organization; the constant search for, and experimentatio �. with, new social and organizational forms on the part of black militants, students, and middle-class anti-war fighters; the resistance of American workers to union-imposed contracts and procedures: all 

are r.eflections of the new stage that emerged in Hungary in 1956. Now, in 1968, the struggle is renewed in France. In 1950 . the following was noted in State Capitalism and World . Revolu �/�n: 

"The Stalinist leaders aim to control the mass proletarIan moblhza-

xxv tion in exactly the same manner as De Gaulle aims to control those of the petty-bourgeoisie. The Leninist party in 1950, in practice where it can, but in theory always, must be the expression of the mass proletarian mobilization aimed against the bureaucracy as such. This bureaucracy in Russia, in France and Italy (even where it is in opposition) and in the United States is the embodiment of the Plan of state-capitalism"(page 57). The revolution in France has already carried the theory of 1950 and the events of 1956 further. It is necessary to say now that Communist Party, Social Democratic Party, Trade Unions, all are bourgeois institutions. They can neither speak for nor negotiate for the revolution. The revolution is not the means by which workers achieve new, socialist institutions to replace the old, bourgeois institutions. The r.evolution is the means by which the socialist institutions emerge and destroy the bourgeois institutions which restrain them. The mode of labor in the United States, that is, the specific form of relations between the working class and its oppressors, also reflects this new stage and must lead to an American equivalent of workers' councils. "The bureaucracy inevitably must substitute the struggle over consumption, higher wages, pensions, education, etc. for a struggle in production. This is the basis of the welfare state, the attempt to appease the workers with the fruits of labor when they seek satisfaction in the work itself. The bureaucracy must raise a new social programme in the realm of consumption because it cannot attack capitalism at the point of production without destroying capitalism itself"(page 41). Since that was written it has been demonstrated in many ways. Negatively, the bureaucracy (especially of the former CIO unions) have demonstrated that they are no longer the simple, corrupt agents of capitalists as were their old-line AFL antecedents. John L. Lewis of the miners, Walter Reuther of the auto workers, Harry Bridges of the longshoremen, and their brothers in other industrial unions have long demonstrated their willingness to participate directly in the management of production and the disciplining of rank-and-file workers through the union contract and the grievance prodecure. No matter how modified the form, this is no longer the traditional behavior of the labor fakers of the epoch of imperialism. This is the Stalinism (or, perhaps, neo-Stalinism) of the labor bureaucracy in the epoch of state capitalism. It should be clear that the term, Stalinism, is not being used in the narrow sense of a faction of the Communist Party. The same distinction is needed to understand the difference between Attlee and Wilson, who were and are deter-

xxvi 

mined that the Labour Party shall administer British capitalism, and Macdonald and his brethren of pre-World War II, who were equally determined that it should not. These are the bureaucrats (in the United States, in Great Britain and elsewhere) whom the Marx ist sectarians are determined to educate to their "responsibliities," or replace with more efficient bureaucrats. The workers, of course, have other ideas. The massive 1955 

wildcats in the VAW for the first time openly counterposed "the struggle in production" to "the struggle over consumption." To Reuther's new national agreement which included the precedent setting Supplemental Unemployment Benefits, the workers replied with "specific local grievances" which, in their tens of thousands, ran the gamut of life in the factory and indicated the determination of the workers to control production. Since then the process has ex panded and intensified, leaving very few industries untouched. In this struggle, Marxist methodology requires that the Hungarian workers' councils act as a goal and a guide. When workers are clearly rejecting the concept of a return to the beginnings of the union, when they are searching for new forms of organization, it is not the function of conscious revolutionists to urge them to confine their struggle to the limits set by labor bureaucrats and the re quirements of capitalist production. It is necessary to describe the struggle as it really is-the search by American workers for their equivalent of the workers' councils. The only alternative is to pre tend that the trade unions can perform some kind of revolutionary function, something they have never been able to do, even under considerably more favorable circumstances. The conception that there is a revoltuionary potential in the American trade union movement has been rejected by American workers. But is serves still to mislead numbers of radicals looking for ways in which to fight the American imperialist colossus by helping to conceal the fundamental division between workers and union officials and the deadl y war that goes on constantly between them. It is only ignorance of this war which can lead to theories that proclaim the incorporation of the workers into the Establish ment (or the disappearance of the working class altogether). It is a peculiar view which believes that workers who have won themselves, through decades of the bitterest and most violent class struggle, increased incomes, private homes and cars, refrigerators and television sets, are therefore more likely to enter the factory each morning of their lives and accept without serious argument in human, totalitarian treatment that is a combination of the peniten-

xxvii tiary and the kindergarten. Quite the contrary: only the struggles, the explosions, the new forms of organization are inevitable . The origin of State Capitalism and World Revolution as a docu ment that was presented to the Trotskyist movement required that it have polemical elements although it was the positive presentation of a profoundly new analysis. This has resulted in its containing names that would be unfamiliar to the ordinary reader. Pablo and Germain were the political pseudonyms of European Trotskyists who held differing views on the problems under discussion. Faced with the collapse of Trotsky's theory, Pablo represented a new or thodoxy which sacrificed Marxist methodology in order to extend Trotsky's defense of the Soviet Union to a principle applicable to all Stalinist societies. Germain, not willing to go that far, intro duced an empirical form of exceptionalism to permit him to decide for himself which Stalinist societies were workers' states and which were not. Max Shachtman was at the time the head of the Workers Party, a split-off from the Trotskyist Socialist Worker � Party. !he Workers Party, after a series of metamorphoses, was dissolved IOto the Socialist Party, of which Shachtman is part of its extreme right wing. The origin of this work as the collective viewpoint of the Johnson-Forest Tendency also dictated that its authorship be anonymous. It is gratifying to be able to record that, with the kinds of assistance from other members of his grouping that are usual for political documents, the author was C. L. R. James. Perhaps this will help to place James, who wrote for a number of years under the pseudonym of J . R. Johnson, in a truer light as a major in heritor and continuator of the Marxist tradition.

# PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION (1956) 

State Capitalism and World Revolution was originally published in 1 950. The origin of the document is as follows. The only serious theoretical opposition to Stalinism was that pro vided over the years by Leon Trotsky. But by the end of World War II, it was obvious that Trotsky's theories no longer had any relation to reality. In the United States, the Johnson-Forest Tendency, a minority of the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party, decided to pre sent to the 1950 Convention of the Party, not a political resolution of the traditional type, but a long overdue restatement of Marxism for our day. The fact that after six crowded years, it can be reprinted exactly as it was written (with the addition of one word, accidentally omitted in the original) is, we believe, sufficient testimony to the soundness of its theoretical premises. There is only one test of any theory and that is experience, life itself. In April 1 956, the Russian jet plane that landed at London Airport announced the existence in Russia of a modern industry and, with it, a modern proletariat. Relations between workers and management in Western Europe and the United States now form a reliable yardstick for the examination of events and pro nouncements in Russia. With this as guide, Khrushchov's report to the 20th Party Con gress makes two things clear. The Russian Communist Party and the Russian unions find themselves in increasing isolation from the all-important productive process of Russia's modern industry. Secondly, under the covering shell of totalitarianism, the actual managers of Russian industry face the same problems as are faced by Dick of Standard's in Coventry or Ford in Detroit and are as baffled by them . Twenty-five years ago in Britain because of lower levels of tool ing, greater craft stratification and the reserve army of unemployed , it was still possible to enforce an effective piece-work system. Its destructive consequences for labor and society were multiplied a thousandfold in the forced industrialization of Russia and was the economic basis of the monstrous regime of Stalin. 

x x i x Those days are over, both in Britain and in Russia. As line produc tion, the conveyor system and highly divided mass productlon h �ve developed in Britain, piece-work has clashed more and more wIth the objective requirements for efficiency. The shop stewards, the shop committees that matured in this period, were not merely economic defense organizations of the workers. They were the only possible means of bringing some order to the chaos caused by the attempts of management to maintain individual piece-work in the new mass-production industries. The workers in Britain have gone a long way toward destroying the piece-work system. On any par ticular line or in any particular shop, a minimum is fixed, below which no o �e may have his wages reduced . By reducing the gap be� ween the minimum and the maximum, the power of the rate-f IXer 1S thereby broken and a levelling of wages takes place . Thus wages are no longer governed by individual effort but by the general level of class struggle in the shop or line concerned. The workers' name for this is action on the job. Action on the job goes far beyond trade unionism for it carries in itself a formidable unity among the workers �nd gives them a control in every phase of production. This control, though constantly contested by management, is never entirely defeated and steadily expands its scope. Today the <;enter of power moves away from the Labour Party and the unions o� to the shop floor. It is from this milieu that have erupte � the startbn ?ly revolutionary demands of the Standard workers In Coventry m

relation to redundancy . These demands have been watered down by the union leadership into compensation and a vague consultation. The original proposals were based on the conception that men and not capital must henceforth be the primary concern of industry. That conviction is deep in the hearts of many millions all over the world, and its objective realization cannot be long delayed. How much different is the "planned economy" of Russia? Listen to Khrushchov at the 20th Party Congress. "Considerable over-fulfilment of such deliberately low output quotas creates the illusion that all is well ., and tends to . divert workers, foremen, and engineers from effecttve efforts to raise pro ductivity. The present practice is to make output quota .s correspon ?

in effect to a definite wage level, and not to the techmcal and effl-ciency levels already achieved. . ." It cannot be considered normal that the proportion o f baSIC wages in the total earnings of a worker is no more than 4:0 to � �deven less in many enterprises. No time should be lost m bnngmg order into the system of wage-rates :n industry, and clearing the 

x x x 

way for introduction o n a mass scale o f technically substantiated output quotas. " Any British worker knows what that means. The planners plan as they please but the Russian workers, by action on the job, accor ding to their strength from factory to factory, make a wreck of the plans, and particularly in the decisive sphere of the planned pro ductivity. And what is Khrushchov 's remedy? "We are faced by the important political and economic task o f introducing proper order into t h e payment of labor. W e must con sistently apply the principles of giving workers a personal material incentive, bearing in mind that the realization of this principle is a prime condition for the uninterrupted growth of production. Lenin taught us that 'every major branch of the national economy should be based on personal incentive' ( Works, Russian ed . Vol. 33, 

p .47). " In other words, the Russian super-planner, in the face of the essentially co-operative labour process of modern industry. has no remedy except the Stalinist knout. Khrushchov, Bulganin and Suslov sing this song in every con ceivable key and thereby show that, despite slave camps, N.K.V.D. and draconic labour laws, it is the workers' shop organizations (probably meeting in secret) which today in Russia as in Britain are setting the norms, levelling the wages and breaking the power of the rate-fixers. The situation of the British Labour Party and the union machinery in face of the dynamic demands and activity of the shop steward movement in Coventry illuminates Khrushchov ' s panic before the isolation of the Communist Party, of the Russian unions and of the Russian economists and scientists from production, and frantic exhortations to all of them to enter production, to study production, to master production, etc . , etc. Six years ago State Capitalism and World Revolution stated that in this contemporary struggle lay the whole future of industry and therefore of society. Control of the national economy offers certain "technical" advantages to those who control . This was known not only to Lenin but to Marx and Engels . But the Russian state plan can deal only with the crudest approximations such as total imput of steel and total output of cars. This had its uses in the Stalinist era, but in modern industry the only cost-accounting that has any serious value is the cost-accounting of the workers on the line, of the thousand and one details of production, constantly organised, checked, modified, discarded and reorganized . This is the only ra-

x x x i tional production and it can be done only by freely associated men. It is totally beyond state planners of any kind, whether with or without parliamentary democracy. For the moment the enormous c�e�tive potentialities of production in these shop organizations are dissipated and even reversed by their use as a defense mechanism against an outmoded managerial class and its political adjuncts. The writers of the document broke with Trotskyism and its fetishism of "nationalization" to concentrate attention on this pro cess in Russia and in the United States. As distinct from all other theories and analyses, these ideas do not isolate the Russian economy and the Russian workers from the rest of the world. They bring all phenomena into one integrated and growing body of theory, shedding new light as new events unfold . The anti-Stalin campaign of the Russian and other Communist Parties exemplifies another fundamental thesis of the document which is that, plan or no plan, totalitarianism is an unviable form of government, doomed to perish by its own contradictions. But their diatribes against Stalin, Khrushchov , Malenkov and Mikoyan deal with the shadow and not with the substance, with the effect and not the cause. Democracy in Russia and the satellite states will herald its coming by the emergence into the open of these pro letarian organizations which all the evidence goes to show are already clandestinely accepted by Russian factory managers. It is these organizations which save modern industrial production from complete chaos and it has been proved that the Nazi Party and the Gestapo were never able to eliminate such formations from Ger man industry. The political conclusions of this economic analysis can be sum med up in its total repudiation of the theory and practice of the Leninist theory of the Vanguard Party for our era. However for the Minority to have written that clearly in the document w �uld have in �ited expulsion from those fanatical Vanguard Partyists, the TrotskYIstS. The reader, therefore, will have to bear this in mind in reading Section VI , the Theory of the Party. Even as it is, it is clear enough, but the following will not be unhelpful. Each of the three great workers' internationals corresponds in f?rm t o a particular stage of capitalism. Lenin's theory and prac tice of the Vanguard Party, the party of the elite, of the leaders was admirably adapted to the period 1903-1923. Progressively fro �

that time, it has been a millstone round the neck of the modern pro letariat in its struggle for socialism. That this form was no creation of Lenin's Machiavellian brain and is rooted in historical cir-

xxx ii 

cumstances is shown by the fact that today the Labour Parties and unions, despite important historical variations, function in essence as Vanguard Parties, that is to say with a centralized machine which, in the accepted Stalinist fashion, is far more tolerant to its programmatic enemies that it is to dissident minorities. What type of new organizations do we propose? We do not pro pose any. The great organizations of the masses of the people and the workers in the past were not worked out by any theoretical elite or vanguard. They arose from the experience of millions of people and their need to overcome the intolerable pressures which society had imposed upon them for generations. The great fact of the present organizations is that they suppress and crush what is always required for the building of a new society, the powers and energies of those who have to build it. Never has there been latent in any society such enormous power, capacities ;and energies as at present exist in the modern working class and the classes nearest to it. But the bigger the traditional organizations grow and the more power they wield, the more they act as a brake upon these creative energies. So rooted are these organizations in the very structure of society that they can be shaken only by an upheaval in the very foundation of society . It is sufficient to say that in historical terms, the new organisations will come as Lilburne's Leveller Party came, as the sections and popular societies of Paris in 1793, as the Commune in 1871 and the Soviets in 1905, with not a single soul having any concrete ideas about them until they appeared in all their power and glory. But once we have a clear historical perspective we can see outlines of the future in the rising in Eastern Germany in 1953, the great strike in Nante S in 195 5 , the general strike against Reuther of the UAW at the very moment he was celebrating his victory of the Guaranteed Annual Wage, the incredible lO-year struggle of the British dockers and now, as we write, the Coventry workers, striding on the national stage, taking the breath away from all observers by the daring and originality of their plans for funning a modern economy. All these struggles, varied as they are in scope and significance, have this in common, that they all embody formations and activity which override, bypass or consciously aim at substituting new social forms for the traditional workers' organizations. However high they soar they build upon shop floor organizations and action on the job. Precisely because America lags behind in traditional 

x x x i i i workers' organizations the mass of the American people are far ad vanced in their conception of the plant (and the office) as the center of the life of the community. The new social and political forms corresponding to the needs of modern industry and modern society can well erupt first in that most modern of countries still politically enchained in the eighteenth century politics of Whigs and Tories, otherwise known as Democrats and Republicans. When the document was written six years ago, all this was mere theoretical prognosis. It is printed now with more confidence as a guide to the great events ahead. It is not the debates on free speech behind the Iron Curtain which will be decisive in the liberation of these oppressed peoples. It is what took place at Poznan. Like the Berlin rising in June, 1953, it came directly from the shop organizations of the workers. The ultimate aim in Coventry, Berlin, Detroit and Poznan is not liberal free speech n o r h igher wages, " c ompensa tion " n o r " consultation" , b u t the construction of a new society from the bot tom up. JOHNSON CHRISTIANSON CHAULIEU BRENDEL MASSEN HUGHES The signers of this preface do not endorse the details of the analysis or of the conclusions of the document but are agreed that Marxism today can find its way only along the path outlined in it.

INTRODUCTION 

# (()I N 1 940 TH E THEORY of Trotskyism seemed founded 

# \VI on a rock. Today, August 4th, 1 950, this is the situation in the world Trotskyist movem ent. 1. The "irresponsible" RCP [ Revolutionary Com munist Party J of Great Britain and a powerful and very responsible minority of US Trotskyists claim that the states 

in Eastern Europe are workers' states. Pablo's latest position is indistinguishable from theirs. 

2. A great majority now accept Yugoslavia, hitherto denounced as a capitalist, totalitarian police-state , as aworkers' state. 

3. The cornerstone of Trotskyist policy for nearly twenty years, that the nationalization of industry alone gave Russia the claim to be a workers' state, is now vigorously denied ; though what then makes it a workers' state is impos sible to see because the Transitional Program says that politically the Stalinist state does not differ from the Fascist state "save in its more unbridled savagery . " 4. Those who are opposed t o the states i n Eastern Europe being considered workers' states denounce the theory as based upon exceptional circumstances and say, rightly, that conclusions would have to be drawn for the whole world. When asked to explain how nationalization took place without the proletarian revolu tion, these bitter opponents of any theory of exceptional circumstances do not hesitate to reply that the nationalizations were due to excep tional circumstances . But one of their number, Germain, generalizes the theory of exceptional circumstances, and declares that the property relations can be overturned without permitting us to conclude that what we have is a workers' state. 

5. Pablo declares: (a) Stalinist parties can under exceptional circumstances lead a proletarian revolution. This destroys the historical 

necessity of the Fourth International. (b) We must be prepared to have degenerated workers' states for centuries. This means either that some capitalism (actually American capitalism) will last for that time ; or that all proletarian revolutions will be b etrayed . To this pro-Stalinist, liquidationist tendency, now months old, there is no resistance. Under the impact of the events of 1 940-50 the theory of the Fourth International is in chaos. Concretely the Majority and the Minority are now engaged in an unrestrained attempt to establish the closest possible alliance with the Communist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY). To this "Johnson-Forest" are opposed and attribute the action to the prevalence in the International, implicit and explicit, of the ideas expressed by Pab lo . 

The "Johnson-Forest" Tendency 

All tendencies inside world Trotskyism, sharp as the differences may be, have been united in adherence to the fundamental theory of the permanent revolution; in main taining the traditions of Bolshevism ; in irreconcilable opposi tion to all other tendencies in the labor movement. The ideas put forward by "Johnson-Forest" originate in that common heritage and have no other purpose than to bind us together in the achievement of our aims. "Johnson-Forest" have abstained almost totally from the Yugoslav discussion and now enter it only to the degree that it is a part of the preparation for definitive decisions. 

2

We ask that our views, however far-reaching, be considered on their merits. We believe that we have earned the right to such a hearing, and more so because in the death-agony o f capitalism, the chief spokesman of the Fourth International has called into question the validity of Marxism for our epoch. We have to mention this because all positions, even Pablo's, claim, and no doubt sincerely, to be interpreting and bringing up to date the basic ideas of Trotsky . We are not doing that. Our position is that the chaos in the Inter national is due to the fact that Trotsky's method o f analysis and system of ideas are wrong, and that the chaos in the International will continue to grow until a new system is substituted for the present one. We are very conscious of the fact that for this system of ideas which we claim must be discarded, thousands have died , and that by it many now living have shaped their lives. But the class position of the proletariat is involved the moment you reach the question of defensism or defeatism . As long as this was confined to Russia, there was no urgent necessity to draw what was implicit to its conclusions. But today the question involves half of Europe and half of Asia, that is to say, the whole world. 

3IWHAT I S STALINISM ? Trotsky's Analysis 

# d1I' HE FIRST, THE BASIC, the indispensable task o f 

# llI i a revolutionary international is to define correctly the working class organization it proposes to overthrow. In 

this task the failure of orthodox Trotskyism is complete. The Transitional Program asserts: "The definite passing over of the Comintern to the side of the bourgeois order-. . . . "

Later the same document says : "The Third International has taken to the road o f reformism . . . . The Comintern's policy . . . demonstrates that the Comintern is likewise incapable of learning anything further or of changing." In the December, 1 93 8 , issue of the New International 

we read why: "Ten years ago it was predicted that the theory of socialism in one country must inevitably lead to the growth of nationalist tendencies in the sections of the Comin tern. This prediction has become an obvious fact . . . . Today we can predict with assurance the inception of a new stage. The growth of imperialist antagonisms, the obvious proxim ity of the war danger and the equally obvious isolation of the USSR must unavoidably strengthen the cen trifugal natio nalist tendencies within the Comintern. Each one o f its sections will begin to evolve a patriotic policy o n its Own account. Stalin has reconciled the communist parties of imperialist democracies with their national bourgeoisies . . . . "

4(Emphasis in original.) In the last pages of The Draft Program of the Co m in tern can be seen the prediction that Stalin's theory o f socialism i n one country would lead the Comintern t o disin tegration into national sections, like the Social-Democracy on August 4th, 1 9 1 4. This is the theory from 1 929 to 1 93 8 , absolutely clear and absolutely wrong. It is precisely this question, this and no other which, since the end of World War II, has crippled the French party. To this day the International does not know whether the Chinese Stalinists are enemies of the Chinese bourgeoisie or collaborators with it. At the World Congress in 1 948 those in Europe who held our views moved that the quoted sections be deleted from the Transitional Program . The motion was voted down. Trotsky, basing himself on the experience of 1 9 1 4-1 9 1 8, believed that there were two fundamental political currents in the world working class movement. One was reformism, the Second International, based upon private property, the defense of the national state, enemy of the proletarian revolution. The other was revolutionary, based upon or fighting for state-property, repudiating the national state, advocate and defender of the proletarian revolution. Between them were various brands of centrism.    

> Upon these premises

he saw the bureaucracy in Russia as centrist, and inevitably headed, as all bureaucracies, for the restoration of private property. That is why the Transi tional Program says : "The fascist, counter-revolutionary elements, growing u ninterruptedly express with ever greater consistency , the interests of world imperialism . These candidates for the role of compradors consider, not without reason, that the new ruling layer can insure their positions of privilege only 

through rejection of nationalization, collectivization and monopoly of foreign trade in the name of the assimilation 5of 'Western civilization,' i.e . .. capitalism . Between these two poles, there are intermediate, diffused Menshevik-SR-liberal      

> tenden cies which gravitate toward bourgeois demo cracy ."

(p. 48. Emphasis added .) And a little later : "From them, i.e., from the right, we can expect ever more determined attempts in the next period to revise the socialist character of the USSR and bring it closer in pattern to 'Western civilization' in its fascist form ." (pp. 49-50.) Again at the World Congress it was moved to delete this from the Program . This was voted down. Two years after the World Congress Pablo has come to a decision. When he says that we have to make up our minds to deal with degenerated workers' states for centuries, he is saying that the bureaucracies in Eastern Europe are organ ically attached to the state-property forms, that they perform a function in production, and this is a form of economy superior to capitalism. The same applies to the Russian bureaucracy, parent and sponsor of the satellite bureaucra cies. This, we have to admit, is Trotskyism, logical and complete. Pablo leaves out only the one thing that Trotsky did not leave out, namely, that if this were so, then Marxism is Utopia. The Analysis of "Johnson-Forest" "Johnson-Forest" repudiate all this, theory, practice and methodology. We base our analysis on the theory of state-capitalism. It is commonly believed that this has mainly to do with defeatism or defensism of Russia. That is the least of our concerns. This is the position of "Johnson-Forest" : (a) A s the Social-Democrats were the labor bureauc racy of monopoly capitalism, the Stalinists are the labor bureaucracy of the period of "vast state-capitalist trusts and 

> 6

syndicates. " (b) The Stalinists are not class-collaborationists, fools, cowards, idiots, men with "supple spines ," but conscious clear-sighted aspirants for world-power. They are deadly enemies of private property capitalism. They aim to seize the power and take the place of the b ourgeoisie. When they support a war or do not support, support the bourgeoisie or do not support , they know exactly what they are doing. The bourgeoisie also knows. In fact everybody, including most workers, knows this, except orthodox Trotskyism. (c) But the Stalinists are not proletarian revolutionists. They aim to get power b y help, direct or indirect, of the Red Army and the protection of Russia and the Russian state. That is the reason why they follow the foreign policy of the Kremlin - it is sheer naked self-interest. (d) Theirs is a last desperate attempt under the guise of "socialism" and "planned economy" to reorganize the means of production without releasing the proletariat from wage-slavery. Historical viability they have non e ; for state ownership multiplies every contradiction of capitalism . Antagonisms of an intensity and scope so far unknown already have Stalinism in their grip. Power merely brings these into the open. (e) The dilemma of the Fourth International is that it has to recognize that there now exists a labor bureaucracy which is the enemy of private property and national defense and yet is counter-revolutionary. The Fourth International cannot escape this decision: if the destruction of private property and the repUdiation of national defense are revo lutionary , then Stalinism is revolutionary and there is no historical need for a F ourth International. (f) These are the questions with which the theory of state-capitalism deals. The theory is not primarily concerned with defensism or defeatism in Russia, about which we can do little. We are primarily concerned here with what the refusal to accept this theory does to the party, its solidarity,

its capacity to fight its enemies, its capacity to preserve itself and to grow , in brief, to prepare the liquidation o f Stalinism .

II THE STALINISTS AND THE THEORY OF STATE-CAPITALISM 

# nT IS VERY EASY to quote from In Defense of Marxism 

# lVl how the Mensheviks stuck to the concrete while Lenin began with dialectical materialism. To carry out Leninism in practice, however, is another matter. Strictly speaking, we should begin with philosophy, but we postpone that to the end of this document where it sums up the whole . We shall begin instead with political economy. It is not b ecause of the policy of the Fourth Interna tional that the world revolution has suffered such defeats. Stalinism is the enemy. We have to pose the question in opposition to Stalinism. For many years now the whole gigantic theoretical machinery of Stalinism has had one main theoretical enemy. This enemy, it will surprise most members of the Fourth International to learn, is the theory of state-capitalism, whether applied to Russia or countries abroad. We have t o add that the Fourth International either does n o t know o r d o e s not care about what the Stalinists are doing i n this field. As we shall see, that is not at all accidental but it makes our task particularly difficult . Before we discuss, we have t o state the facts and conditions o f discussion. Marx removed p olitical economy from intellectual theorizing and made it a weapon of the class struggle. He placed it in the very heart of the capitalist system, in the process of production itself. For him the fundamental antagonism of society was the contradiction between the development of the productive forces and the social relations 

9of production . Inasmuch as this conception is what the Stalinists are using all the power of the Russian state t o destroy, we must spend some time here. In the United States since 1 9 35 the working class in the CIO is mobilized to fight any increase in the productivity of labor. Speed-up does not mean necessarily work beyond physical or mental endurance. The proletariat as a class is opposed to increase of productivity of labor in any form , whether it is speed-up of the line or the machine, or the further division of labor. It is convinced in the very marrow of its being that any such increase is obtained only at the expense of its own most vital material and spiritual interests. But the capitalist class is equally convinced that the desire of the workers to have the decisive word on production standards is opposed to the vital interests of the capitalist system which they represen t . Both sides are absolutely cor rect upon the basis of capitalist production. The clash is final and absolute. Marx established that as long as the proletariat did not rule production, production knew and could know no other method of progress but the increase of constant capital, machinery, mechanization, at the expense of variable, living labor. The only revolution which could save society was the proletarian revolution in the process of production. Further he showed that this system not only created the violent clash in social relations . Inevitably the rate o f profit would fall and (theoretically) a t a certain stage the economy would not be able to expand any further because it would lack sufficient surplus value. In his strictly logical theory Marx expressly excluded any idea that the system would collapse b ecause goods could not be sold . In his analysis of collapse he made it absolutely clear that the capitalist could sell all the goods he produced. This would not alter the conditions of the workers in the factory . It is possible to keep silent about this, but to deny it - that is impossible. The Stalinists do not go so far. All 

1 0 

Marx's theories of crisis, overproduction, commercial - crisis, etc., to which he paid careful attention, all are based on this foundation of relations in production.  

> A ll

his opponents, however diff�rentiated among them selves, are united in this, that they see the solution of the crisis of capitalism in every conceivable place except the reorganization of the productive process by labor itself. From Section 1 , Chapter 1 , Vol . 1 of Capital, this is precisely what Marx opposed. The very categories he used, and the content he gave to them as categories of exploitation, were derived from his analysis of the mode of labor, and without it he could not have succeeded in defeating all his opponents. 

It is obvious, therefore, that the Marxian theory from its very elements is an invincible weapon against the capitalist class or a usurping bureaucracy , whether the property is private property or state-property. It is equally obvious that a bureaucracy, caught in the throes o f economic crisis and in the name of Marxism exploiting millions of workers, has a deadly enemy in this theory. If the Marxian categories apply to Russia, then it is a simple matter to say that Russia is a form of state-capitalism. The Marxist categories therefore become for the Stalinist bureaucracy the concrete theoretical enemy . 

The Stalinists Revise Marx's Capital 

In 1 943 Leontiev published his celebrated Political Economy in the Soviet Union . There was a crisis in political economy in the Soviet Union. He tells us that for years the teaching of political economy had stopped en tirely . The reason will astonish most of the readers of this document. The Soviet youth studying Capital found themselves unable to see how the categories, money , wages, etc., as described in Capital differed from the categories as they appeared in the Russian reality. (No such doubts trouble orthodox 

1 1 Trotskyists.) Leontiev described the measures adopted. Economists were henceforth to teach : (a) that these categories existed before capitalism , hence are not integral to capitalism ; (b) that they meant something different in each period and hence mean something different in Russia. Thus Marx's analysis of the categories of capitalism, the foundation of Marxism , received the first blow. But the Stalinist theoreticians had something positive to sUbstitute. Above all, they said, these categories have always b een part and parcel of private property capitalism and exploita tion of man by man . There is no private property in Russia , hence no exploitation of man by man, hence these categories are not the same. But this ridiculous sophistry could not shake Capital. 

Two years later the Stalinists had to drop the pretense that only the "teaching" of political economy was being changed. Nothing short of a break with the dialectic structure of Capital would do. They decided to reorganize Capital 

thoroughly, b eginning with page 1 of Chapter 1 of Volume 1 . 

Marx had begun the analysis of capitalism with the analysis of the commodity . The Stalinists repudiated his method, stating that to "preserve unchanged the same sequence" would be "ludicrous and harmful pedantry." The new theory was explained for English readers in Marx 's Capital: An A id to the Study of Political Economy by Leontiev, 1 946. 

The Stalinists have drowned Marx's specific categories of capitalist exploitation. They have to, b e cause they cannot differentiate them from the economic system in Russia. They know who the enemy is. In his article Leontiev thundered against the "Trotskyite-Bukharinist wreckers" : "It is known that enemies of socialism of various brands bourgeois economist wreckers, restorers of capitalism from the camp of the Trotskyite-Bukharinist agency of fascism -have tried to extend to socialist economy the laws of capital ist economy. To suit their wrecking counter-revolutionary 

1 2 

purposes they have slanderously perverted the character of the socialist relations that have been introduced among us, falsifying them, repainting them in the colors of capitalist relations. " We hope no one b elieves that the Stalinists go through all this merely for 'Trotskyite-Bukharinist-fascists." To any one who knows them and reads Leontiev's article, it is perfectly obvious that there is inside Russia itself a tendency to call Russia state-capitalism and the Stalinists can only fight it by mutilating Capital. They must attempt in theory as well as in practice to destroy every manifestation of the developing revolution in Russia. The theory of state-capital ism is the theoretical foundation for this revolution. 

> The Stalinists and the Falling Rate o f Profit

Orthodox Trotskyism lives peaceably while all this goes on. I t repeats : State-property, therefore no laws of capital ism . The whole meaning of the present discussion is that those days are over. But what about overproduction, asks orthodox Trot skyism? There can be no overproduction in Russia, hence the system is superior, et c., etc. The Stalinists are taking care of that too . The method is to destroy the theory of the falling rate of profit and substitute the theory of the market, under consumptionism. If state-property, and not the total reorga nization of labor, is the solution to the contradiction o f capitalism, then the proletariat has only t o work hard (and very hard ) until in the fulness of time, there is enough for all. In 1 943 Leontiev wrote i n his essay a moderate para graph which looked innocent but was part of the assault on 

Capital and the Russian proletariat . " . . . the law of value under capitalism operates through the law of the average rate of profit, whereas in the socialist system of national economy the law of the average rate of 

1 3 profit has lost its significance." Thus, in place of the law in the decline in the rate of profit, Le., the insoluble contradiction o f capitalism due to value production, the Stalinists have substituted the average rate of profit or the distribu tion of the total profits among the capitalists. The average rate of profit is singled out as the crucial feature o f Volume III of Capital. *

Prior to World War I, the debates in the Marxist move ment revolved around Volume II of Capital. The theory of accumulation was urgent only insofar as it concerned wheth er imperialist expansion could solve the contradictions of capitalism. By World War II this was no longer the question. Not only had the contradictions of capitalism not been solved b y imperialist expansion ; there was a crisis in produc tivity on a world scale . The debate of necessity has shifted from Volume II (expanded reproduction) to Volume III (decline in the rate of profit) . The debate over Volume III o f Capital i s the debate over the developing revolution on a world scale and especially in Russia . If the problem is selling goods, then there is abso lutely no economic reason for the collapse of the bureauc racy. If, however, the problem is the rate of surplus value in production, needed for expansion, then the bureaucracy is faced with a revolution in the process of production itself. It will be possible to fill twenty volumes of books with quotations about overproduction from Marx and Marxists. 

In this disp u te they will have the same validity as the num erous witnesses the chicken-stealer was prepared to bring' who hadn 'f seen him steal the chickens. They will not alter the fact that Marx's theory of capitalist collapse is based (tho ugh not exclusively) upon the falling rate of profit. It              

> 'Insignificant minority as were "Johnson-Forest," we did what we could to defend Marxist theory the Stalinist revision. Through the agency of Raya Dunayevskaya, we publication of the document by translating it, attacked Leontiev and routed the chief Stalinist fellow-travellers

in the United States who came to his defense. (American Economic Review, September, 1944 to Septem ber, 1945 inclusive.)

assumes that all the goods are sold, there is no overproduc tion, and yet capitalism will collapse. The importance of this for the analysis of Stalinist Russia is obvious. It destroys the Stalinist contention that because Russia, unlike capitalism , has no problem of sale of goods, the Russian economy is superior. We have in many places taken up this question in full. Here we can only state the case : As late as 1 9 3 5 , Maurice Dobb, British Stalinist , says : " . . . consumption was an incident - an important inci dent - in the total setting . . . . At the same time it remained 

only a facet ; and it seems clear that Marx considered the contradiction within the sphere of production - the contra diction between growing productive power, consequent on accumUlation, and falling profitability of capital, between the productive forces and the productive relations of capital ist society - as the essence of the matter." (Political Econ omy and Capitalism , p . 1 2 1 .) 

No kind o f underconsumptionism could pass as M arxism chiefly because Lenin (who wrote constantly of anarchy of production, individual appropriation , etc.) had nevertheless written the finest analysis of Capital in existence, a devastat ing and comprehensive polemic against all who tried to say that capitalism would collapse because it could not "realize " 

profit, Le., sell its goods. *

Eugene Varga in Russia, however (with some sneaking apologetics, for Varga knows better), for years' propagated the view that capitalism would collapse from underconsump tion while the nationalized production could not. Then in 

1 942 appeared The Theory of Capitalist Development by Paul Sweezy. Sweezy posed two fundamental types of crise s : "In t h e o n e case we have to do with movements in the rate of surplus value and the composition o f capital, with           

> *See especially the nut chapter of his Capitalism in Russia, "Theoretic Mistakes of the Nafodnik-Economists," translated into English by F. Forest, New Inter national, October, November, December,

1943. 

1 5 the value system remaining intact." This is the Marxist view, the political economy of the proletariat. Paul Sweezy has another view. He goes on to say : "In the other case we have to do with as yet unspecified forces tending to create a general shortage in effective de mand for commodities . . . . " (p. 1 46 . ) This i s the political economy o f underconsumption. Previously it could be used to some degree by the petty bourgeoisie. Today it is the absolutely inescapable political economy of the bureaucracy. Marx's analysis showed that inevitably, though the mass of profit would grow, total profit in relation to total capital would grow less and less, and theoretically, would bring the system to a standstill. * It is only after having proved this that Marx takes up overproduction, etc. Sweezy says that Marx's analysis of the falling rate of profit seems to be some rough notes he just jotted down . * * He scoured the three volumes o f Capital i n an attempt t o prove his underconsumptionist interpretation. H e could find nothing but some odd scraps which were already notorious as completely inadequate. He had to admit as much. (Ibid ., 

p . 1 78 . ) But Sweezy would not give up. Instead he proposes : "Another view is possible, however, namely, that in these scattered passages Marx was giving advance notice of a                        

> *The falling rate of profit is no longer theory. Like so much of Marx's abstract analysis the proof now is before our eyes. Who in his senses today thinks that the world is suffering from an excess of capital? Where? In Britain, in France, in Italy, in Japan, in India, in Brazil, in China? Where, pray, where? From every where the cry rises for capital. The total mass of surplus value produced in rela tion to the total social capital is hopelessly inadequate. It may be useful (though we doubt this) to point out the fabulous profits of this or that company in the United States. This is no more than a variety of American exceptionalism. These profits will never be able to rebuild world economy. Europe; China, India under capitalism will perish for lack of capital to continue ever-greater expansion. This capitalist system is finished, finished for good and all. Only the released prole tariat can produce sufficient to rebuild society. No one has to read Marxism any longer to understand this. All that is necessary is to look. **Comrades should not spend all their indignation on this. They will need some a few pages later and not for Sweezy.

1 6 line of reasoning which, if he had lived to complete his theoretical work, would have been of primary importance in the overall picture of the capitalist economy ." So that in thirty years and nearly 3 ,000 pages Marx was merely giving advance notice. Sweezy's book was written in 1 942. Since then, in the latest issue of Science and Society (Spring, 1 9 50), this fellow traveller has become the authentic voice of the Stalinist maneuver to defend Russia against the theory of state-capital ism. As usual, the maneuver takes the form of historical analysis. As always, it seeks desperately to remove the class struggle from the process of production. In this article, Sweezy has reached the advanced stage of replacing the Marxist concept of the internal contradiction in production with a wholly external contradiction, between production for use and production for the market. We hope, therefore, that this ghost of overproduction which has stalked about in our movement so long and dis rupted economic analysis of Russia will go to its grave and stay there ; or if it reappears will be injected by its sponsors, however temporarily, with some real blood and life. 1 7 III LENIN AND STATE CAPITALISM 

# d)E'q UALLY INSTRUCTIVE IS the Stalinist treatment 

# \VJ:l of state-capitalism and planning. Here a little history is necessary. It was Marx in Capital (Vol. 1 , Kerr edition, p. 68 8), 

who stated that the only limit to centralization was all the capital in a single country in the hands of a single corpora tion: If this is not the economic form of state-capitalism, what is it? It was not a chance remark. He did not have it in the first edition. He wrote it into the second edition with some other points and asked all to note that the additions possessed "a scientific value independent of the original." On this no word, not a word from the Stalinists, and not a word from orthodox Trotskyism. In A nti-Duhring Engels writes the passages so well known that we shall not quote them. They are so clear that there were members of the Workers' Party who discussed them with the cynicism that Engels was a "Johnsonite." It was either this or saying that "Johnson-Forest" were follow ers of Engels. They preferred the first. Marx, it is known, approved Engels' draft. In his criticism of the Erfurt Program, Engels attacked the formulation that there was no plan in capitalism . He ends : "And if we pass from joint companies to trusts which command and monopolize entire branches of industry, then we not only cease to have private production but we cease to have planlessness. " 

1 8 

Karl Kautsky, while denying that capitalism can plan, never thought of d enying statification. In 1 90 7 Kautsky wrote in explanation of the Erfurt Program : "The final result must be the concentration of all the instruments of production in the hanQS of one person or one stock company, to be used as private property and be dis posed of at will ; the whole machinery of production will be turned into a gigantic concern subject to a single master." 

(The Class Struggle The Erfurt Program , Kerr, 1 9 1 0. ) 

Lenin's treatment o f the whole question i � a model of Marxism. In imperialism ( 1 9 1 5), he writes only of monopoly capitalism. Then you can trace how stage by stage he reaches state-monopoly capitalism in the preface to State and Revo lution ( 1 9 1 7). 

In the Spring of 1 9 1 7, in his first report in Russia on the Political Situation, Lenin described how during the war capitalism had developed even more than before the war. Then : "As early as in 1 89 1 , i.e., twenty-seven years ago . . .Engels maintained that capitalism could not be regarded any longer as being planless. This idea has become obsolet e ' once there are trusts, planlessness disappears. . . . MonoP �lY in general has evolved into state-monopoly." (Collected Works. Revolution of 1 91 7, Boo k 1 , p . 2 8 2 . ) 

Then comes a paragraph in which h e separates himself from the whole underlying p olitical economy of the Fourth International : "General conditions show that the war has accelerated the development of capitalism ; it advanced from capitalism to imperialism ; from monopoly to nationalization. All this made the socialist revolution closer and created the objective conditions for it. Thus the course of the war has brought the socialist revolution nearer to us." Although Kautsky, for example, had a different theory from Lenin on state-capitalism, all Marxists (until the Fourth International) agreed on this, that the centralization of 

1 9 capital, however great, did not lessen but increased the crisis of capitalism. It is in the theory of the degenerated workers' state that our whole movement has learned to see in a completely centralized capital, regeneration, progress 

for capitalism. In the reply to the debate, Lenin quoted from the resolution on which he was speaking : "Monopoly capitalism is changing into state-monopoly capitalism . Social regulation of production and distribution is, under the pressure of circumstances, being introduced in many countries." (p. 3 1 6 .) He says again : "It is noteworthy that twenty-seven years ago Engels pointed out that to characterize capitalism as something distinguished by its planlessness, means to overlook the role played by trusts, and is unsatisfactory . . . . This remark of Engels is particularly appropriate now, when we have state monopoly capitalism. The introduction of planning into industry keeps the workers enslaved none the less, though it enables the capitalists to gather in their profits in a more planful way. We now witness the metamorphosis of capital ism into a higher, a regulated form of capitalism. " And here must b e noted a remarkable thing. Obviously that resolution on which Lenin was speaking would be a very important document. The Stalinist archivists say that no copy can be found. Be that as it may, as we have shown in 

The Invading Socialist Society (p. 5ff.), the whole, yes, the whole strategy of the October Revolution was built on this. In State and R evolution, Lenin says that the trusts cannot, of course, plan production completely but however much they do plan, they cannot avoid the contradictions of capitalism . Not mere nationalization, even "confiscation," Lenin repeated and repeated, means military penal labor for the workers ; you must have workers' control of production under a soviet state. The theoreticians of Stalinism avoid 20 all this like the plague. Then in . 1 9 1 8 Lenin throws his whole weight against the Left-Communists, basing himself upon this theory : "To elucidate the question still more, let us first of all take the most concrete example of state capitalism. Every body knows what this example is. It is Germany. Here we have 'the last word' in modern large-scale capitalist technique and planned organization, subordinated to Junker-bourgeois imperialism . Cross out the word in italics, and in place of the militarist, Junker-bourgeois imperialist state , put a state, but of a different social type, of a different class content - a 

Soviet, that is, a proletarian state, and you will have the sum total of the conditions necessary for socialism. " (Selected Works, Vol. VII, pp. 364-5 .) He says again : "At present, petty-bourgeois capitalism prevails in Rus sia, and it is one and the same road that leads from it to large-scale capitalism and to socialism, through one and the same intermediary station called 'national accounting and control of production and distribution.' Those who fail to understand this are committing an unpardonable mistake in economics." (Ibid., p. 366.) And once again he refers to his previous work on the question of state-capitalism : "In order to convince the reader that this is not the first time I have given this 'high' appreciation of state capital ism and that I gave it before the Bolsheviks seized power I take the liberty of quoting the following passage from my pamphlet The Threatening Catastrophe and How to Fight It 

written in September, 1 9 1 7 ." (Ibid., p. 367.) When he introduced the NEP, Lenin quoted this passage to the extent of three pages. Lenin did not know German Fascism or the United States economy during the war, but his whole method shows that in his usual manner, always watching the stages, he would have had not the slightest diffi culty with Fascist Germany and Yugoslavia or contemporary 2 1 Poland. There is nothing, absolutely nothing in the past of Marxism to prevent a Marxist saying that in its death-agony, capitalism, though in its classic form an economy of private property, can reach a stage where the capitalist class can plan the economy as a whole. This would have been a great tri umph for our movement, so well laid were the foundations and the method in the past. But our ancestors could say this because Marx, Engels, Lenin, Bukharin, took it as a corollary that centralization meant the intensification of the crisis for such a capitalism. But up to 1 9 1 9 this was not the issue. Bukharin's theory of state-capitalism is not ours, and was criticized even in his own day, but he elaborated it in the ABC of Communism , 

the book was highly praised by Lenin and was sold in mil lions of copies and several languages as an official party textbook. Why? Because he wrote that even if anarchy of individual capitalism was abrogated by state-capitalism, collapse was still inevitable. Had he written the opposite the denunciations would have started with Lenin. That was Bolshevism. And that was how Trotsky wrote in the First Manifesto of the Communist International : "The state control of social life against which capitalist liberalism so strived, is become a reality. There is no turning back either to free competition or to the domination of trusts, syndicates, and other kinds of social anomalies. The question consists solely in this : who shall control state pro duction in the future - the imperialist state or the state of the victorious proletariat?" To this 1 9 1 9 analysis of Trotsky's, "Johnson-Forest " still subscribe wholeheartedly . Pablo and State-Capitalism It is obvious (and this is only a small selection o f the material) that the whole past of our movement made it 22 difficult to escape the theoretical possibility that Russia might be a form of state-capitalism. The Stalinist theoreti cians knew all this. There had been restlessness in Russia over it. (No such restlessness stirred the majority of Trotskyists, secure in the belief that the nationalized property rendered all such considerations useless.) But - once Pablo decided 

on the road he was following, he recognized state-capitalism as the enemy. He warns against it repeatedly, warns Germain that that is where he will end, and undertakes at last to explain it. Pablo explains that when Engels wrote about state capitalism he was "like Trotsky . . . referring to the tenden cy." This is a positive crime. Trotsky and Engels were here at opposite poles. Trotsky writes : "State-capitalism means the substitution of state-property for private property and for that very reason remains partial in character." Engels writes : "Taking over of the great institutions for production and communication, first by joint-stock companies, later on by trusts, then by the State."* What did Pablo expect Engels to write : "Taking over of the great institutions of production, each and every single one, by which I mean omitting none, etc. , etc."? Pablo continues : "Engels in that day little suspected the enormous concentration of monopoly capitalism which followed his epoch. " Engels spoke continually of trusts, trusts, trusts. Lenin and others constantly referred to Engels' analysis of trusts, trusts, trusts. In the quotation already cited, Engels says, "trusts which command and monopolize entire branches of industry." Pablo flips the great achievements of Marxism into the dustbin. What fanaticism is this? "Johnson-Forest" have met it before, in the Shachtmanites. When faced with                 

> *Engels writes this in a supplement to the chapters from Anti-Duhring, which he reprinted in SOcialism, Scien tific and Utopian. No one so far, not even the Stalinists as far as we know, has ever denied that the original statements in Anti Duhring theoretically take the question to complete state-ownership.

23 questions like these, their attitude always was: Tear down the skies; root up the foundations ; let everything go to ruin rather than accept this simple fact: No rearrangement o f capital o n capital's side of the barricades, actual o r t o the furthest degree of theoretical possibility, can solve the contradictions of capitalism which remain the exclusive task of the revolutionary proletariat. Who opposes Pablo? All we have seen so far is some Shachtmanesque leaps and jumps by Germain. In The Invad ing Socialist SOciety (p. 24) we quoted Lenin and prodded Germain. No answer. Now suddenly, life having destroyed his theory, charac teristically Trotskyist , that only the masses could nationalize property in Eastern Europe, and under pressure by Pablo, Germain announces in portentous language and big print : "We are confronted by transitional cases, cases of com bined development, in which the property relations can be overturned without the economy thereby automatically becoming , an economy orienting away from capitalism toward socialism, and without permitting us to conclude that what we have is a workers' state." ( The Yugoslav Ques tion, the Question of the Buf fer Zone, and their Implication for Marxist Theory , p . 1 2.) 

"IN THESE T RANSITIONAL SITUATIONS THE LAW OF COMBINED DEVELOPMENT CAN PRESENT CASES IN WHICH THE STATIFICATION OF THE GREATEST PART OF THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION AND EX CHANGE CAN BE THE WORK OF A NON-WORKERS' STATE. IN SUCH SITUATIONS, THIS STATIFICATION THEN CEASES TO BE AN A UTOMA TIC CRITERION 

PROVING THE EXISTENCE OF A WORKERS' STATE. " 

(Ibid. , p . 1 4 .) This is the theory of exceptionalism so devastated by Trotsky, transferred to the whole world. In passing it gives the same treatment to the economic basis of the Trotskyist theory of state-property that Pablo gives to Engels, throws it 24 on the dust heap . Who accepts this, who does not accept this, we do not know. If this is not chaos, we are willing to use any other word which is suggested to us.  

> Varga and

State-Capitalism No such confusion is tolerated near the Stalinists. For a brief period, when it seemed they were uncertain of their relation with Western Europe, they themselves called the states in Eastern Europe state-capitalism. Even they recog nized that they were either workers' states or state-capital ism, even they . Then when the line turned, they went straight back to Leontiev in 1 943 . This is what is falsely known as the Varga controversy around Varga's book Changes in the Political Economy of Capitalism Resulting from the Second World War. It was not Varga alone. It was practically the whole staff of the Institute of World Economics which he headed. Faced with the fact that capitalism had not col lapsed, Varga was the mouthpiece of the Institute which could find a reason for the continued existence of capitalism only in the fact that capitalism moved to state-capitalism, which could plan. Varga was more careful than Pablo because he at least said that this eqUilibrium would last for a decade and not for centuries. His economic theory was also superior to Pablo's. For at the same time, along with his underconsumptionism , Varga, the mouthpiece, very cautiously re-introduced the theory of the falling rate of profit, holding it so to speak in reserve against his previous underconsumptionism . Despite the caution, these statements by Varga showed that the Stalinists know very well how to analyze state-capitalism and the falling rate of profit. When the turn came, the reaction was brutal. In the course of the discussion on Varga's book one bold woman, Maria Natavno Smit, attacked Varga from the left : 25 "The book," she began, "lacks an analysis of the great new change connected with the transition from simple monopoly capitalism to state-monopoly capitalism, as Lenin understood this transition." She then proceeded to quote Lenin: "During the war, world capitalism took a step forward not only toward concentration in general, but also toward state-capitalism in even a greater degree than formerly." 

(Collected Works, Russian ed., XXX, p. 300.) Smit concluded : "Where Lenin unites the concept of 'state' and of monopoly, Comrade Varga seems to separate them : each exists by itself and meanwhile , in fact , the process of c �alescence of the state with monopoly manifests itself quite sharply at the present time in such countries as the U.S.A. and England." It was an attempt to start where Lenin had left off, and by his method to deal with the vast experiences of thirty years. She was stamped down at once. "Imperialism is what Lenin elucidates. This is the stage of decay and death of capitalism, beyond which no new phase of capitalism follows . . . . I think one should agree with Comrade Varga who does not seek such a phase and does not try to establish a transition to such a phase." *

And this "new phase" would be what? Nothing else but state-capitalism. They know that Lenin's whole method prepared for this and nothing else but this. Varga in his tum said that Smit "tried to advance a new theoretical idea," and that "the question is one of terminol ogy and not one of substance." Leninism and with it the theory of state-capitalism was buried once more. The outline is necessarily summary. It is not the fault of "Johnson-Forest" if we have, in 1 950, to spend so much space and time on what should be elementary questions in

26 this discussion. But if we do not do it, who else will? We have said enough to show how profoundly state-capitalism and everything connected with it is embedded in the past and is today in the center of the arena and of the crises in Stalinist political economy. And the Fourth International? A blank, a complete and comprehensive blank! Worse. Every word it writes fortifies Stalinism . 2 7 IV REARMING THE PARTY OF WORLD REVOLUTION 

# �HE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN the Third International .. , and the Fourth must be seen first as profoundly antag onistic theories of sociology , of accumulation, of capitalist collapse, of planned economy, of what constitutes bureauc racy , of what constitutes the party - a totally different methodology which in the end amounts to the aims and methods of different classes. "Johnson-Forest" are confident that our theory presents such an opposition to Stalinism . We shall analyze and confront these two point by point. And each time we shall also show how inadequate is the theo ry of the Fourth International as an opposition to Stalinism . 1 . (a) Stalinist sociology rests on the theory that the conversion of private property into state-property is the conversion of capitalism into socialism. (b) The Fourth International must oppose to this that the basis of socialism is the emancipation of the proletariat from enslavement to capital, i.e ., soviet power, the state power in the hands of the proletariat in its own proletarian organizations. This and this alone constitutes socialism, anew society, and a new state, or a transition to a new society. (c) Trotsky denied absolutely that it was possible for private property to be concentrated into the hands of the state except by proletarian revolution.* He put state-property on the proletarian side of the barricades. On this proposition    

> *On this Hansen and E. R. Frank have said all that is necessary and cannot be answered. They are striving to apply the doctrine they have been brought up on. That is why they are so wrong.

28 Trotsky was wrong but not confused. (d) Today, however, on this simple but basic proposi tion, official Trotskyism shows a mass of equivocation and confusion which grows every hour and from which it is im possible to extract any guiding line whatever. 

2 . (a) The Stalinists claim today that the distinguish ing characteristic of capitalism in contrast with socialism is anarchy of production due to individual appropriation based on private property. Therefore , according to them, the fun damental economic crisis of capitalism is due to ineffective demand, the inability of markets to absorb production. State property abolishes these fundamental antagonisms of capital ism and thereby becomes a superior society which can plan. 

(b) The Fourth International must show that the basic economic contradiction of capitalism is in production, the falling rate of profit . This a totally centralized capital cannot overcome. (c) Trotsky obviously was familiar with this (the fun damental theoretical question of Marxian economics for two generations). He never committed himself to any theory of underconsumption. But his whole conception of the superi ority of planned economy was based on the law of value as anarchy and the superiority of state-property because it and it alone allowed society to plan. (d) Today the press of official Trotskyism is ridden with underconsumptionism. On the other hand, on the question of the capacity of centralized capital to plan, it is today im possible to get any guiding line, as witness the resolution of the IEC, as to why planning is impossible in the satellite countries, very properly exposed by Hansen. Germain does not know the difference between the falling rate of profit and ,the average rate of profit and by a not at all accidental fatality, he follows Leontiev in writing average rate of profit where he should write falling rate. Pablo tells us that within a society with the "new prop erty relations" of general statification, "the laws of capitalist 29 economy operate in a changed fashion and not automatically 

or blindly ."* ( Yugoslavia and the Rest of the Buffer Zones, 

p. 1 3 , emphasis in original.) In the same bulletin he tells us that a capitalism which achieved complete statification would be a "regenerated capitalist state," and it would "mean con siderable progress and in no sense a decline." (/bid., p. 4.) 

Just note, please, the phrase "in no sense a decline ." We have made it clear that, in harmony with all the great Marxists, we believe that capitalist planning does not in the slightest degree allow it to escape the laws of capital ism, which are at this stage intensified and irresistible. But observe, if you please, a leader of our movement, in this period , the death-agony of capitalism, can find laws of capi talism which, however, will show no decline. Observe, too, that nobody attacks him. 

3. (a) The theory of Stalinism denies that the eco nomic manifestation of the new society is the qualitatively 

increased productivity of labor. It substitutes instead as 

criterion the quantitative accumulation of goods, or growth of "the socialist sector," Le . , state-property. It sees the prob lems of Stalinist production exclusively as a problem of relations between means of production and means of con sumption, a relation which it claims to control. This can b e modified to the eventual advantage of the proletariat solely by increase of capital. The inequalities and sufferings of the Russian workers are, therefore, due to lack of consumption goods, the result of the need for accumulation. Upon this basis the distinguishing feature of Stalinist production is the need for increase of n orms and intensifi cation of labor, an incessant hounding and driving of the workers in production in the name of increased accumula tion. This. is the Stalinist theory, refined and elaborated in a thousand documents. (b) To this the Fourth International must oppose the

1943.

view that the new productive system of socialism is primarily distinguished by an entirely new organization of labor within the process of production itsel f, in a reorganization of society beginning in the factory, the center of production relations, resulting in a form of labor that will as far surpass capitalism as capitalism surpassed feudalism. Marx's theory is based upon the fact that as long as production is carried on "within the conditions of production themselves by special agents in opposition to the direct producers," accumulated labor is in opposition to living labor ; as it accumulates, misery accu mulates, and the class struggle paralyzes productivity and production. (c) Trotsky saw the strictly economic decline of capital ism in the fact that world capitalism could no longer quanti tatively increase accumulation. This has been proved utterly false. All that this conspicuously false theory of accumula tion does is to fortify the Stalinist contrast between the presumed incapacity of capitalism to accumulate and the presumed power of Russia to accumulate indefinitely. Historically, Le. , concretely, the monopoly of capital is a "fetter" upon production. It is not an absolute barrier. Lenin vigorously denied that the stagnation of capitalism meant cessation of growth. The Marxist analysis is increase of conflict, of crisis and of degeneration, as a result of increase of growth. Trotsky declared that the proletariat does not grow under world capitalism and declines in culture. This is abso lute ly false and is in direct opposition to the thesis of Marx that in the very crisis of capitalism the proletariat is "always increasing in numbers and is united, disciplined and orga nized," i.e., prepared socially for its tasks, by the very mechanism of capitalist production itself. (d) Today with Russian production far beyond what it was in 1 936, the year of The Revolution Betrayed, orthodox Trotskyism, as is shown in the World Congress Resolution of 

1 94 8 , still teaches that the Stalinist barbarism is rooted in the 

3 1 struggle over consumption goods. 'This theory fails to expose the greatest crime in Russia, the monstrous daily persecution of millions of workers in the very process of production. It does more. It attributes the Stalinist state-power, the most monstrous in history, of more unbridled savagery than the state of German fascism, it attributes all this to the struggle over consumption goods within the framework of a higher form of economy_ The Stalinists attribute any crisis in production in Russia to "remnants of capitalist ideology in the working class." Orthodox Trotskyism finds the remnants of capitalist ' ideology in the thieving bureaucracy. But the method is the same, subjectivism . Sociology based upon form of property, i.e., relations between men and things, a theory of accumulation based upon consumption, socialism as the plan by which these inequalities of property and consumption are readjusted -this is the sociology, the economics and the politics of Stalin ism inside and outside Russia. Sociology based upon relations of production, that is to say, relations between people, a theory of accumulation based upon production, socialism as the organization of a higher mode of labor, that is the theory the International of world revolution must adopt. That is the theory of "Johnson Forest," the theory of state-capitalism, Marxism of our 

period . It is this theory which the Stalinists wish to destroy, root and branch, in every implication and manifestation. And that is not in the least surprising. What we call the theory of state-capitalism is the theory of the proletariat as a class directed against capital and any agent of capital, in this case the bureaucracy. Thus the difference between Stalinism and "Johnson-Forest" is a difference of class. Every line of Stalin ist theory aims at the obliteration of the question of class in the theory and practice of what they call socialism. And regrettably, very regrettably, we shall have to show that the 

32 

theories of the Fourth International have fortified the theories of Stalinism . The true significance of Pablo is that he has brought this that was implicit in the theories of the Fourth International out into the open. 

3 3 v

TIlE CLASS STRUGGLE 

# tt' HE STALINIST THEORY is, despite zigzags, logical 

# ., and consistent. like every theory of all exploiters it is the theory of the rulers, the result of their struggle with the direct producers whom they exploit, and of competition with other rulers. The theory justifies Stalinist exploitation of the Russian workers. It can be used as a weapon against the tra ditional bourgeoisie in the struggle for the domination of the world working class movement without impairing the posi tion of the rulers inside Russia. It fortifies this position in the minds of the public which is interested in these questions and the members and fellow-travellers of the Stalinist parties . The theory itself is an adaptation of the pre-Marxian petty-bourgeois ideology from Kant to Sismondi and Proud hon to the specific conditions of state-capitalism . That we shall go into later. But then as now its purpose can be summed up in a phrase the radical reorganization of society with the proletariat as object and not as subject, I.e., with no essential change in the mode of labor. The crisis of world-capitalism, a hundred years of Marxism, thirty years of Leninism, impose upon this theory, as a primary task, the need to destroy and to obscure the theory of class struggle in the process of production itself, the very basis of Marxism and of the proletarian revolution. The Stalinists did not arbitrarily "choose" this theory. Politics on the basis of the analysis of property is of necessity the struggle over correct policy and the correction of "evil." Social division, if not rooted in classes, automatically 34 becomes a selection of personnel. The criterion not being a criterion of class becomes automatically a criterion according to competence, ability, loyalty, devotion, etc. This personnel, comprising many millions, the Stalinists have enshrined in the 1 93 6 constitution under the name of "our socialist intel ligentsia. " The most competent, the most able, most loyal, most devoted, the elite become the party. The instrument of the party is the state. The corollary to disguising the rulers of production as "our socialist intelligentsia" is the Stalinist denunciation of bureaucracy as inefficiency, red tape, rude ness to work;ers, laziness, etc. - purely subjective character izations. The Bureaucracy in Industry The first task of the revolutionary International is clarification of this term, bureaucracy. The Stalinists take advantage of the fact that Marx often used the term, bureauc racy, in relation to the mass of state functionaries. But with the analysis of state-capitalism by Engels, the word bureauc racy began to take on a wider connotation. Where Engels says "Taking over of the great institutions for production and communication, first by joint-stock companies, later on by trusts, then by the State," he adds : "The bourgeoisie demonstrated to be a superfluous class. All its social func tions are now performed by salaried employees." (Socialism, Utopian and Scientific, p. 1 3 8.) These are bureaucrats. The moment Lenin saw the Soviet, the new form of social organization created by the masses, he began to extend the concept, bureaucracy, to include not only officials of government hut the officials of industry, all who were op posed to the proletariat as masters. This appears all through 

State and Revolution and, in its most finished form, in the following: "We cannot do without officials under capitalism, under 

3 5 the rule of the bourgeoisie . The proletariat is oppressed, the masses of the toilers are enslaved by capitalism. Under capi talism democracy is restricted, cramped, curtailed, mutilated by all the conditions of wage-slavery, the poverty and misery of the masses. This is why and the only reason why the offi cials of our political and industrial organizations are cor rupted - or more precisely, tend to be corrupted by the conditions of capitalism, why they betray a tendency to become transformed into bureaucrats, i.e., into privileged persons divorced from the masses and superior to the masses. "This is the essence of bureaucracy, and until the capitalists have been expropriated and the bourgeoisie overthrown, even proletarian officials will inevitably be 'bureaucratized' to some extent." Lenin's whole strategic program between July and Octo ber is based upon the substitution of the power of the armed masses for the power of the bureaucrat , the master, the offi cial in industry and in p olitics. Hence his reiterated statement that if you nationalize and even confiscate , it means nothing without workers' power. Just as he had extended the analysis of capitalism , to state-capitalism and plan, Lenin was devel oping the theory of class struggle in relation to the develop ment of capitalism itself. This strengthened the basic con cepts of Marxism. Marx says : "The authority assumed by the capitalist by his personification of capital in the direct process of pro duction, the social function p erformed by him in his capacity as a manager and ruler of production, is essentially different from the authority exercised upon the basis of production by means of slaves, serfs, etc. "Upon the basis of capitalist production, the social character of their production impresses itself u pon the mass of direct producers as a strictly regulating authority and as a social mechanism of the labor process graduated into a com plete hierarchy. This authority is vested in its bea �ers only as a personification of the requirements of labor standing above 36 the laborer." (Capital, Vol. III, p. 1 ,027.) This is capitalist production, this hierarchy. The special functions are performed "within the conditions of produc tion themselves by special agents in opposition to the direct producers." (p. 1 ,025). These functionaries, acting against the proletariat in production, are the enemy. If this is not understood, workers' control of production is an empty phrase. With the development of capitalism into state-capital ism, as far back as 1 9 1 7, Lenin, in strict theory, denounced mere confiscation in order to concentrate his whole fire upon the hierarchy in the process of production itself, and to counterpose to this, workers' power. It thus becomes ever more clear why the Stalinists in their theory will have noth ing whatever to do with state-capitalism and rebuke and stamp out any suggestions of it so sharply. The distinction that Lenin always kept clear has now developed with the development of capitalism over the last 30 years. It has now grown until it becomes the dividing line between the workers and the whole bureaucratic organization of accumulated labor, science and knowledge, acting against the working class in the immediate process of production and everywhere else. This is the sense in which the tenn bureaucracy must be used in Russia.  

> HA Higher Social Organization of Labor"

It is upon this Leninist analysis that the theory of state capitalism rests, and inseparable from this theory, the con cept of the transition from social labor as compulsion, as barracks ' discipline of capital, to social labor as the voluntary association, the voluntary labor discipline of the laborers themselves . Lenin in "The Great Beginning" theoretically and practically wrote an analysis of labor in Russia which the development of society on a world scale during the last 3 7 30 years, now raises to the highest p osition among all his work on Russia. This must be the foundation of a Marxist approach to the problems of economics and p olitics under socialism . In that article Lenin did two things : (a) Established with all the emphasis at his command . that the essential character of the dictatorship of the prole tariat was "not violence and not mainly violence against the exploiters." It was the unity and discipline of the proletariat trained by capitalism, its ability to produce "a higher social organization of labor." (b) Analyzed the Communist days of labor given to the Soviet state and sought to distinguish the specific social and psychological characteristics of a new form of labor, and the relation of that to the productivity of labor. With all its mighty creations of a Soviet state and Red Army, and the revolution in the superstructure, it is here that the Russian socialist revolution could not be comple ted. The "historical creative initiative" in production, the "subtle and intricate" relations of a new labor process these never developed for historical reasons. But there has been a vast development of capitalism and of the understanding of capitalism all over the world since the early days of the Russian Revolution. The British Chancellor of the Excheq uer, the Stalinist bureaucracy, the whole capitalist class in the U.S. (and in the U.S. m ore than anywhere else) all declare that the problem of production today is the produc tivity of labor and the need to harness the human interest, i.e., the energy and ability of the worker. Many of them are aware that it is the labor process itself which is in question. What they see partially, contemporary Marxism must see fully and thereby restore the very foundations of Marx ism as a social science. It is in the concrete analysis of labor inside Russia and outside Russia that the Fourth International can find the basis of the profoundest difference between the Third Inter national and the Fourth International. The whole tendency 

38 

of the Stalinist theory is to build up theoretical barriers between the Russian economy and the economy of the rest of the world. The task of the revolutionary movement, begin ning in theory and as we shall see , reaching to all aspects of political strategy, is to break down this separation. The development of Russia is to be explained by the development of world capitalism and specifically, capitalist production in its most advanced stage , in the United States. Necessary for the strategic task of clarifying its own theory and for building an irreconcilable opposition to Stalinism, it is not accidental that this method also is the open road for the revolutionary party to the socialism inherent in the minds and hearts, not only of the politically advanced but the most backward industrial workers in the United States. It is for this reason that the analysis of the labor process in the United States must concern us first and only after wards the labor process in Stalinist Russia. 

The Mode of Labor in the United States 

Roughly, we may attribute the decisive change in the American economy to the last part of the nineteenth century and the first part of the twentieth century, taking 1 9 1 4 as aconvenient dividing line. After World War I the Taylor sys tem, experimental before the war, becomes a social system, the factory laid out for continuous flow of production, and advanced planning for production, operating and control. At the same time there is the organization of professional societies, management courses in college curricula and re sponsible management consultants. Between 1 924 and 1 928 

there is rationalization of production and retooling (Ford) * . Along with i t are the tendencies to the scientific organization of production, to closer coordination between employers,  

> *A similar process in Germany led straight to Hitler.

3 9 fusion with each other against the working class, the inter vention of the state as mediator and then as arbiter. For the proletariat there is the constantly growing subdivision of labor, decrease in the need of skills , and deter mination of the sequence of operations and speed by the machine. The crisis of 1 929 accelerated all these processes. The characteristic , most advanced form of American produc tion becomes Ford. Here production consists of a mass of hounded, sweated labor (in which, in Marx's phrase, the very life of society was threatened); and opposed to it as a class, a management staff which can carry out this production only by means of a hired army (Bennett) of gangsters, thugs, supervisors who run production by terror, in the plant , in the lives of the workers outside production, and in the politi cal control of Detroit . Ford's regime before unionization is the prototype of production relations in fascist Germany and Stalinist Russia. But and without this, all Marxism is lost inex-tricably intertwined with the totalitarian tendency is the response of the working class. A whole new layer of workers, the result of the economic development, burst into revolt in the CIO. The CIO in its inception aimed at a revolution in production. The workers would examine what they were told to do and then decide whether it was satisfactory to them or not. This rej ection of the basis of capitalist economy is the preliminary basis of a socialist economy. The next p ositive step is the total management of industry by the proletariat . Where the Transitional Program says that the "CIO is the most indisputable expression of the instinctive striving of the American workers to raise themselves to the level of the tasks imposed upon them by history; ' it is absolutely correct. The task imposed upon them by history is socialism and the outburst , in aim and method, was the f ITst instinctive prepa ration of the social revolution . Because it was not and could not be carried through to a conclusion, the inevitable counterpart was the creation of 

40 

a labor bureaucracy . The history of production since is the corruption of the bureaucracy and its transformation into an instrument of capitalist production , the restoration to the bourgeoisie of what it had lost in 1 936, the right to control production standards. Without this mediating role of the bureaucracy, production in the United States would be violently and continuously disrupted until one class was undisputed master. The whole system is in mortal crisis from the reaction of the workers. Ford, whose father fought the union so uncompromisingly as late as 1 941 , now openly recognizes that as far as capitalism is concerned, improvements in tech nology, i.e . , the further mechanization of labor, offers no road out for the increase of productivity which rests entirely with the working class. At the same time, the workers in relation to capitalism resist any increase in productivity. The resistance to speed up does not necessarily mean as most think that workers are required to work beyond normal physical capacity. It is resistance by the workers to any increased productivity, Le. , any increase of productivity by capitalist methods. Thus, both sides, capital and labor, are animated by the fact that for each, in its own way, the system has reached its limit. The real aim of the great strikes in 1 946 and since is the attempt to begin on a higher stage what was initiated in 1 93 6 . But the attempt is crippled and deflected by the bureaucracy , with the result that rationalization of produc tion, speed up, intensification of exploitation are the order of the day in industry. The bureaucracy inevitably must substitute the struggle over consumption, higher wages, pensions, education, etc . , f o r a struggle i n production. This i s the basis o f the welfare state, the attempt to appease the workers with the fruits of labor when they seek satisfaction in the work itself. The bureaucracy must raise a new social program in the realm of consumption because it cannot attack capitalism at the point 

4 1 of production without destroying capitalism itself. The series of pension plans which have now culminated in the five-year contract with General Motors is a very sharp climax of the whole struggle. This particular type of increase in consumption subordinates the workers to production in a special manner after they have reached a certain age. It con fines them to being an industrial reserve army, not merely at the disposal of capital in general but within the confining limits of the specific capitalist factory which employs them . The effect, therefore, is to reinforce control both of em ployers and bureaucracy over production. But along with this intensification of capitalist produc tion and this binding of the worker for five years must go inevitably the increase of revolt, wildcat strikes, a desperate attempt of the working class to gain for itself conditions of labor that are denied to it both by the employers and the labor bureaucracy. While the bureaucracy provides the lead ership for struggles over consumption, it is from the workers on the line that emerges the initiative for struggles over speed up . That is precisely why the bureaucracy, after vainly trying to stop wildcat strikes by prohibiting them in the contract, has now taken upon itself the task of repressing by force this interruption of production. It expels from the unions work ers who indulge in these illegal stoppages, i.e . , who protest against the present stage of capitalist production itself. The flying squads, originated by the union for struggle against the bourgeoisie, are now converted by the bureaucracy into a weapon of struggle against the proletariat, and all this in the name of a higher standard of living, greater consumption by the workers, but in reality to ensure capitalist production. The increase of coercion and terror by the bureaucracy increases the tendency of the workers to violent explosion . This tendency, taken to its logical conclusion, a s the workers will have to take it, means the reorganization of the whole system of production itself - socialism. Either this or the complete destruction of the union movement as the 

> 42

instrument of proletarian emancipation and its complete transformation into the only possible instrument of capital against the proletariat at this stage of production. This is the fundamental function of the bureaucracy in R ussia . Already the tentative philosophy of the bureaucracy in the United States, its political economy of regulation o f wages and prices, nationalization and even planning, its ruth less political methods, show the organic similarity of the American labor bureaucracy and the Stalinists. The struggle in the United States reveals concretely what is involved in the Stalinist falsification of the Marxist theory of accumula tion, etc., and the totalitarian violence against the proletariat which this falsification protects. In the recent coal strikes, despite the wage and welfare gains of the miners, the heads of the operators declared that control of production had been restored to them by the two year contract. C. E. Wilson, president of General Motors, hailed the five-year settlement as allowing the company "to run our own plants," and as "the union's complete accept ance of technological progress." Reuther hailed the G.M. settlement as a "tremendous step forward" in "stabilizing labor relations at G.M . " An editor of Fortune magazine hailed the contract as the harbinger of "new and more mean ingful associative principles" with the corporation as "the center of a new kind of community." The Stalinist bureaucracy is the American bureaucracy carried to its ultimate and logical conclusion, both of them products of capitalist production in the epoch of state capitalism. To reply to this that the bureaucracy can never arrive at maturity without a proletarian revolution is the complete degradation of Marxist theory. Not a single Marxist of all the great Marxists who analyzed state-capitalism , not one ever believed capitalism would reach the specific stage of complete centralization. It was because of the necessity to examine all its tendencies in order to be able to mobilize theoretical and practical opposition in the proletariat that 

> 43

they followed the dialectical method and took these tenden cies to their conclusions as an indispensable theoretical step. 

In the present stage of our theory it is the scrupulous analusis of production in the United States as the most advanced stage of world capitalism that forms the indispensable pre lude to the analysis of the labor process of Russia. 

The Mode of Labor in Russia /

The Russian Revolution of October, 1 9 1 7, abolished feudalism with a thoroughness never before achieved. The stage was therefore set for a tremendous economic expan sion. Lenin sought to mobilize the proletariat to protect itself from being overwhelmed by this economic expansion. The isolated proletariat of backward Russia was unable to do this. The subsequent history of the labor process of Russia is the telescopic re-enactment of the stages of the process of production of the United States; and, added to this, the special degradation imposed upon it by the totalitarian control of the bureaucracy and the plan. The Russian Revolution in 1 9 1 7 substituted for the authority of the capitalist in the factory the workers ' control of production. Immediately there appeared both the concrete development of self-initiative in the factory and the simplifi cation of the state apparatus outside. There was workers' control, with some capitalists as owners, but mere owners. Production conferences, not of bureaucrats but of workers, decided what and how to produce. What capitalists there remained seemed to vanish into thin air once their economic power was broken, and workers' control was supplemented the following year by nationalization of the means of produc tion . The red thread that runs through these first years o f workers' rule, workers' control, seems to suffer a setback under war communism in general and with order 1 042* in       

> *This was the order issued in the attempt to get the completely disorganized

44 particular. It takes less than a year for the workers to force a change, and the all-important trade union debate of 1 920 follows. Lenin fights successfully both Trotsky, the adminis trator, and Shlapnikov, the syndico-anarchist, and strives to steer a course in consonance with the Declaration of the Rights of the Toilers, that only the masses "from below" can manage the economy, and that the trade unions are the transmission belts to the state wherein "every cook can be an administrator ." 

Stalinism in the Russian Factory 

In the transition period between 1 924 and 1 92 8 when the First Five-Year Plan is initiated, the production confer ences undergo a bureaucratization, and with it the form o f labor. There begins the alienation o f mass activity t o conform to specified quantities of abstract labor demanded by the plan "to catch up with capitalism." The results are : (a) In 1 929 ("The year of decision and transforma tion") there crystallizes in direct opposition to management by the masses "from below" the conference of the planners, 

the engineers, economists, administrators ; in a word, the specialists. (b) Stalin's famous talk of 1 93 1 "put an end to deper sonalization ." His "six conditions" of labor contrasted the masses to the "personalized" individual who would outdo the norms of the average. Competition is not on the basis of creativity and Subbotniks, * * but on the basis of the                    

> railroad system to function. The railroads were placed under almost military rule, subordinating the ordinary trade union democracy to "Chief Political Depart ments» which were established in the railway and water transport workers' unions. As soon as the critical situation had been solved, the transport workers demanded the abolition of the "Chief Political Departments" and the immediate restoration of full trade union democracy.

**Subbotniks were the workers who on their own initiative volunteered to work five hours' overtime on Saturdays without p ay in order to help the economy of the workers' state. From the word Subbota, meaning Saturday. 

4S outstanding individual (read : bureaucrat) who will devise norms and have others surpass them. (c) 1 93 5 sees Stakhanovism and the definitive forma tion of an aristocracy of labor. Stakhanovism is the pure model of the manner in which foremen, overseers and leader men are chosen in the factories the world over. These indi viduals, exceptional to their class, voluntarily devote an intensity of their labor to capital for a brief period, thus setting the norm, which they personify, to dominate the labor of the mass for an indefinite period . With the Stakhanovites, the bureaucratic administrators acquire a social base, and alongside, there grows the instabil ity and crisis in the economy. It is the counter-revolution of state-capital. (d) Beginning with 1 939 the mode of labor changes again. In his report on the Third Five-Year Plan, Molotov stressed the fact that it was insufficient to be concerned merely with the mass of goods produced. The crucial point for "outstripping capitalism" was not the mass but the rate 

at which that mass was produced. It was necessary that per capita production be increased, that is to say, that each worker's productivity be so increased that fewer workers would be needed to obtain an ever greater mass of goods. Intensity of labor becomes the norm. During the war that norm turned out to be the most vicious of all forms of exploitation. The Stalinists sanctified it by the name of "socialist emulation. " "Socialist emula tion" meant, firstly, that the pay incentive that was the due of a Stakhanovite was no longer the reward of the workers as individuals, once they as a mass produced according to the new raised norm. In other words, the take-home pay was the same despite the speed up on a plant-wide basis. Secondly, and above all , competition was no longer limited to individ ual workers competing on a piecework basis, nor even to groups of workers on a plant-wide basis, but was extended to cover factory against f actory.

Labor Reserves are established to assure the perpetua tion of skills and a sufficient labor supply. Youth are trained from the start to labor as ordered. The climax comes in 1 943 

with the "discovery" of the conveyor belt system . This is the year also of the Stalinist admission that the law of value functions in Russia. We thus have :  

> 1 9 1 8 :

The Declaration of the Rights of Toilers - every 

cook an administrator.  

> 1 92 8 :

A bstract mass labor - "lots" of it "to catch up with capitalism. "  

> 1 93 1 :

Differentiation within labor - "personalized" individual; the pieceworker the hero.  

> 1 93 5 :

Stakhanovism, individual competition to surpass the norm.  

> 1 936-3 7 :

Stalinist Constitution : Stakhanovites and the intelligentsia singled out as those "whom we respect."  

> 1 93 9-4 1 :

Systematization of piecework; factory com peting against factory.  

> 1 943 :

"The year of the conversion to the conveyor belt system. " Whereas in 1 93 6 w e had the singling out o f a ruling class, a "simple" division between mental and physical work, we now have the stratification of mental and physical labor. Leontiev's Political Economy in the So viet Union lays stress not merely on the intelligentsia against the mass, but on specific skills and differentials, lower, higher, middle , in between and highest. If we take production since the Plan, not in the detail we have just given, but only the major changes, we can say that 1 93 7 closes one period. It is the period of "catching up with and outdistancing capitalism" which means mass pro duction and relatively simple planning. But competition on a 

world scale and the approaching Second World War is the severest type of capitalist competition for world mastery. This opens up the new period of per capita production as 

> 47

against mere "catching up." Planning must now include productivity of labor. Such planning knows and can know only machines and intensity of exploitation . Furthermore, it includes what the Russians call rentabl 'nost, that is to say profitability. The era of the state helping the factory whose production is especially needed is over. The factory itself must prove its worthiness by showing a profit and a profit big enough to pay for "ever-expanded " production. And that can be done only by ever-expanded production of abstract labor in mass and in rate. 

Nowhere in the world is labor so degraded as in Russia today. We are here many stages beyond the degradation which Marx described in the General Law o f Accumulation. For not merely is the Russian laborer reduced to an append age to a machine and a mere cog in the accumulation of capital. Marx said that the reserve army kept the working laborer riveted to his martyrdom. In Russia, because of the power to plan, the industrial reserve army is planned. Some 

1 5 million laborers are planned in direct forced labor camps. They are organized by the MVD (GPU) for production . The disciplinary laws which began with reduction in wages · for coming 1 5 minutes late have as their final stage, for lack of discipline, "corrective labor," i.e . , the concentration camp. What the American workers are revolting against since 

1 93 6 and holding at bay, this, and nothing else but this, has overwhelmed the Russian proletariat. The rulers of Russia perform the same functions as are performed by Ford, Gen eral Motors, the coal operators and their huge bureaucratic staffs. Capital is not Henry Ford ; he can die and leave his whole empire to an institution ; the plant, the scientific appa ratus, the method, the personnel of organization and super vision, the social system which sets these up in opposition to the direct producer will remain . Not inefficiency of bureau crats, not "prestige, powers and revenue of the bureaucracy," not consumption but capital accumulation in its specifically capitalist manner, this is the analysis of the Russian economy. 

48 

To think that the struggle in Russia is over consumption not only strikes at the whole theory of the relationship o f the superstructure t o the productive mechanism. In practice , today, the crisis in Russia is manifestly the crisis in produc tion. Whoever is convinced that this whole problem is aproblem of consumption is driven away from Marxism, not toward it. The Crisis of State-Capitalism It was Marx's contention that the existence of a laboring force compelled to sell its labor-power in order to live meant automatically the system of capitalist accumulation. The capitalist was merely the agent of capital. The bureaucrats are the same. Neither can use nor knows any other mode of production. A new mode o f production requires primarily that they be totally removed or totally subordinated. At this p oint it is convenient to summarize briefly the abstract economic analysis of state-capitalism. We have never said that the economy of the United States is the same as the economy of Russia. What we have said is that, however great the differences, the fundamental laws of capitalism operate. It is just this that Marx indicated with his addition to Capital dealing with complete centralization of capital "in a given country ." "A given country" meant one specific country, i.e., the laws of the world-market still exist. If the whole world became centralized, then there would be a new society (for those who want it) since the world-market would have been destroyed. Although completely centralized capital "in agiven country" can plan, it cannot plan away the contradic tions of capitalist production . If the organic composition o f capital on a world scale i s 5 t o I , moving to 6 to I , to 7 t o I , etc. , centralized capital in a given country has to keep pace with that. The only way to escape it would be by a

49 productivity of labor so great that it could keep ahead of the rest and still organize its production for use. Such a pro ductivity of labor is impossible in capitalism which knows only the law of value and its consequence, accumulated labor and sweating proletarians. That is precisely why Engels wrote that though formally, Le., abstractly, complete state-property could overcome the contradictions, actually it could not, the "workers remain proletarians." The whole long dispute between underconsumption and rate of profit theorists has now been definitively settled precisely by the experience of Russia. Lenin in 1 9 1 7 repeated that state-capitalism without the Soviets meant "military penal labor" for the workers. The Soviet power was the road to socialism. The struggle in Russia and outside is the struggle against "military penal labor" and for the Soviet power. The revolt which gave birth to the CIO prevented American capital from transforming the whole of American production and society into the system which Ford and Bennett had established. This mon strous burden would have driven capital still further along the road of accumulation of capital, domination over the direct producer or accumulation of misery, lowered produc tivity, barbarism, paralysis and gangrene in all aspects of society. That was Germany. That would be the plan, the plan of capital, and with state-property it is more free than before to plan its own ruin . The totalitarian state in Russia prevents the workers from making their social and political experiences in open class struggle. But by so doing, it ensures the unchecked reign of capital, the- ruin of production and society, and the inevitability of total revolution . The decisive question is not whether centralization is complete or partial, heading toward completeness. The vital necessity of our time is to lay bare the violent antagonism of labor and capital at this definitive stage of centralization of capital. Whether democratic or totalitarian, both types of 

> 50

society are in permanent decline and insoluble crisis. Both are at a stage when only a total reorganization of social rela tions can lift society a stage higher. It is noteworthy that in the United States the capitalist class is aware of this, and the most significant work that is being done in political economy is the desperate attempt to find some way of reconciling the working class to the agonies of mechanized production and transferring its implacable resistance into creative co-opera tion. That is of educational value and many of its findings will be used by the socialist proletariat. In Russia this resist ance is labelled "remnants of capitalist ideology" and the whole power of the totalitarian state is organized to crush it in theory as well as in fact . We shall see that upon this theoretical analysis the whole strategy of revolutionary politics is qualitatively dif ferentiated from Stalinism, inside and outside Russia. The Stalinists seek to establish themselves in the place of the rival bureaucracy. The rival bureaucracy seeks to substitute itself in the place of Stalinism. The Fourth International must not seek to substitute itself for either of these, not after, not during nor before the conquest of power. Theory and prac tice are governed by the recognition of the necessity that the bureaucracy as such must be overthrown. 

> The Bureaucratic Administrative Plan

We can now come to a theoretical conclusion about the question of plan and with it, nationalization. For the capi talist mode of labor in its advanced stages, the bureaucratic administrative plan can become the greatest instrument of torture for the proletariat that capitalism has yet produced. State-property and total planning are nothing else but the complete subordination of the proletariat to capital. That is why in The invading Socialist Society we summed up our total theory in two points, the first of which is : 

> 5 1

" 1 . IT IS THE TASK OF THE FOURTH INTER NATIONAL TO DRIVE AS CLEAR A LINE BETWEEN BOURGEOIS NATIONALIZATION AND PROLETARIAN NATIONALIZATION AS THE REVOLUTIONARY THIRD INTERNATIONAL DROVE BETWEEN BOURGEOIS DEMOCRACY AND PROLETARIAN DEMOCRACY ." 

All theory for our epoch must begin here. 

But aren 't state-property and the plan progressive? State-property as such and plan as such are metaphysical abstractions. They have a class content. Aren't trusts pro gressive, Lenin was asked in 1 9 1 6 . He replie d : "It i s the work of the bourgeoisie to develop trusts, t o drive children and women into factories, to torture them there, corrupt them and condemn them to the utmost misery . We do not 'demand' such a develo'pment ; we do not 'support' it ; we struggle against it. But how do we struggle? We know that trusts and factory work of women are pro gressive. We do not wish to go backwards to crafts, to pre monopolist capitalism, to domestic work of women. Forward through the trusts, etc., and beyond them toward socialism ! " 

( Th e Bolsheviks and the World War, p . 495 . ) W e reply similarly. This is Marxism - the antagonism of classes. Under capitalism, private or state, all science, knowledge, organization, are developed only at the expense and degradation of the proletariat. But at the same time capitalism organizes the proletariat for struggle. We do not "demand" or "support" plan. We propose to substitute proletarian power and subordinate plan to the revolutionary struggle of the proletariat . Where does orthodox Trotskyism stand on this? Every member knows the answer. Nowhere. Its conception of plan is summarized in the slogan in the Transitional Program : 

"The plan must be revised from top to bottom in the inter ests of the producers and consumers." The capitalist plan cannot be revised except in the interests of capital. It is not the plan that is to be revised. It 

52 

is the whole mode of production which is to be overthrown. The whole analysis is in terms of (to use the underlined phrases of the Transitional Program) "social inequality " and 

"political inequality . " In Th e R evolution Betrayed the chap ter entitled "The Struggle for Productivity of Labor" deals with money and plan, inflation, rehabilitation of the ruble. It says that analysis of Stakhanovism proves that it is a vi cious form o f piecework. But it soon returns to the question of the ruble. And it finally ends on the note that the Soviet administrative personnel is "far less adequate to the produc tive tasks than the workers." Therefore, what is needed is more competence, more efficiency, less red tape, less lazi ness, etc. If the Russian b ureaucracy were more efficient, more scientific, etc., the results for the Russian proletariat would be worse. The chapter "Social Relations in the Soviet Union" in 

The Revolution Betrayed deals with the privileges, wages, etc. of the bureaucracy in relation to the workers. Neither in the Transitional Program nor The Revolution Betrayed does analysis of the worker in the production process find any place, except where in the Program the slogan is raised , "Fac tory committees should be returned the right to control production." In the analyses of orthodox Trotskyism there are a few references here and there to creative initiative being needed at this stage. That is all. All the slogans in the Transitional Program d o nothing more than demand the restoration of democracy to where it was in 1 9 1 7 , thereby showing that the whole great experi ence of thirty years has passed orthodox Trotskyism by. World capitalism has moved to the crisis and counter-revolu tion in production. The program for the reintroduction of political democracy does no more than reintroduce the arena for the reintroduction of a new bureaucracy when the old one is driven out. But, after all, production relations must include some where workers, labor, the labor process - the place where 

5 3 the population is differentiated by function. The World Congress Resolution (F o urth International, June, 1 948) 

quotes from Th e Revolution Betrayed an elaborate summary by Trotsky of his own position in 1 93 6 . The worker in the labor process is not mentioned. The resolution asks : What alterations have to be made in the analysis following the development of the past eleven years? It b egins : " . . . the social differentiation is the result of bourgeois norms of distribution ; it has not yet entered the domain of ownership of the means of production. " The struggle out of which the CIO was born, the domi nation of the machine, the drive for greater productivity, what about that? The Orthodox Trotskyist in 1 9 50 would have to reply : the question is not a question of production. It is a question of collective ownership ; it is a question of the thieving bureaucracy taking for itself consumption goods which belong to the workers; it is a question of whether the bureaucracy passes laws of inheritance ; it is a question in 

1 9 50 as it was in 1 93 4 of whether the tendency to primitive accumulation will restore private property, etc., etc. Is this an inj ustice to Orthodox Trotskyism? If it is, then what 

would it reply, and where is any other reply to be found? 

54 

VI THE THEORY OF THE PARTY 

# fa \ THE STALINIST THEORY and practice of the party 

# \; II.J is the direct result of the Stalinist conception of Plan. The party consists of the elite, the most efficient, the most loyal, the most devoted, etc. The party mobilizes the prole tariat, politically, economically and morally, to carry out the Plan. There is here no parallel with the political parties and politics of capitalist competition and bourgeois democracy. In state-capitalism the state becomes capitalistic in the sense of administration, supervision , control against the proletariat. The party forms the state in its own image, which is the re flection of the productive process of state-capitalism. That was the party of Hitler (despite historical differences), that is the party of Stalin. The Stalinist parties outside Russia function on the same model. Their attitude to the membership and the proletariat is that of an elite leading backward workers. All initiative, policy, direction comes from the Stalinist leaders. Society will be saved if it follows them, defends them, puts its trust in them. Historical circumstances may alter their practice, but in their fundamental conceptions there is no difference whatever between the CP in Russia and the CP in the United States. (b) Upon the basis of its analysis of state-capitalism and Plan, the Leninist party must form its own revolutionary theory of the party. The party is, in Lenin's words, based upon the factory but upon the progressive co-operation aspect of the factory : unity, discipline and organization o f 

5 5 the working class, in unalterable opposition to the theory and practice of the elite. Every age has its own specific development of produc tion and its specific social relations. Each separate Interna tional has its o wn separate (and antagonistic) conception of the party which is rooted in its own social base and its con ception of its political tasks in relation to that base. Marx's conception of the party in 1 848, the way he organized the First international, carefully explained by him ; the organiza tion of the Second International which Lenin accepted as sound up to 1 9 1 4 ; the organization of the Third Interna tional, all were different and show a dialectical progression. Lenin never conceived of a mass party of two and a half million people bef ore the struggle for power. The whole of the Stalinist theory and practice of the organization of the party is based upon the administrative bureaucratic Plan . Conversely, the revolutionary party expands and devel ops its own theory on the basis of the vast revolutionary upheavals which are stim ulated in the proletariat by the structure of state-capitalism . The European proletariat in Italy, in France, in Spain , and the American proletariat, have already shown us that from the beginning of the social revo lution, the proletariat as a whole will be organized to become the state and to manage production. Here concretely is the embodiment of Lenin's reiterated phrase "to a man" which was impossible of realization in backward Russia in 1 9 1 7. Not only does the revolutionary proletariat of our age make its tremendous mass mobilizations. The petty-bour geoisie does the same as in the Nazi party and the almost overnight creation of the French Rally of millions by de Gaulle. The Stalinist leaders aim to control the mass prole tarian mobilizations in exactly the same manner as de Gaulle aims to control those of the petty-bourgeoisie. The Leninist party in 1 9 50, in practice where it can, but in theory always, must be the expression of the mass proletarian mobilization 56 aimed against the bureaucracy as such. This bureaucrac y

in Russia, in France and Italy (even where it is in opposition) and in the United States is the embodiment of the Plan of state-capitalism. No question is more important theoretically, not only internally but externally , than this of the relation between party, the state and the Plan. For theoreticians and millions of workers everywhere it is the central question. No substan tial section of any society today will die in defense of private property. That today is dead. The question is: can the na tionalized property be planned without having as the inevit able consequence the domination of a single party? The popular formulation , one-party state, is absolutely and exactly right. "Johnson-Forest" have given here the essentials of the answer. 

(c) What does the Fourth International have to say on this question? It can be summed up in the following : The Stalinists are criminals, opposed to democracy in the party; the Trotskyists are believers in democracy as practiced b y Lenin . The history of Trotskyist theory of the party, however, reinforces Stalinism in spite of all its criticism. In 1 93 1 Trot sky believed that "with the weakening of the party or with its degeneration even an unavoidable crisis in economy can become the cause for the fall of the dictatorship." What actually took place was the reverse. When the bureaucratic administrative Plan of the ruling class was finally substituted for the planning of the revolutionary proletariat, it was the Bolshevik party that was liquidated . State-property remained. (d) Fifteen years later with the Bolshevik party de stroyed, the Fourth International improves upon the original thesis. The World Congress thesis says : "The political dictatorship today as twenty years ago is decisive in preventing the complete collapse of planning, the breakthrough of the petty-capitalist market, and the penetra tion of foreign capital into Russia." 57 "The political dictatorship" is an abstraction. Concretely it is the party of Stalin, the murderers of the Bolshevik Party, the antithesis in every respect of the Bolshevik Party. The theory is false whether it is standing on its head or its feet, and in either form it is useless as a theoretical weapon against Stalinism. (e) Unfortunately, this conception is not confined to Russia. The first sentence of the Transitional Program states that the crisis of the revolution is the crisis of revolutionary leadership. This is the reiterated theme. Exactly the opposite is the case. It is the crisis of the self-mobilization of the proletariat. As we shall show, and it is perfectly obvious logically, this theme of orthodox Trot skyism implies that there is a competition for leadership, and that whereas the other Internationals have betrayed, the Fourth International will be honest. Exactly the contrary must be the analysis. The concept that the whole problem is a problem of revolutionary leadership does not, cannot, upon its political premises, pose on the one hand the Stalinist leadership as clear-sighted, determined leaders with their own theory, program, policy for the enslavement of the proletariat ; and opposed to them, ourselves as leaders, not simply "honest" but with a totally different conception of the role , movement and function of the proletariat. Honesty and dishonesty, sin cerity and betrayal imply that we shall do what they, because of "supple spines," have failed to do. We do not propose to do what they have failed to do. We are different from them in morals because we are different from them in everything, origin , aims, purposes, strategy, tactics and ends. This funda mental antagonism "Johnson-Forest" derive from the theory of state-capitalism . From the Stalinists' observation of state-capitalism,  

> their

conception of the party becomes the essence of bu reaucracy, bureaucratic administration , bureaucratic organi zation, the bureaucratic party. For the Fourth International, 58 on the other hand , it is a matter of life and death, in the analysis of modern economy, to counterpose what has been created by the modern economy, the mass mobilization of the proletariat and sections of the petty-bourgeoisie, as an opposition in form and content to Stalinism and the Social Democracy, and our role as a party in relation to this. To say that all the proletariat needs is revolutionary leadership drowns all differences between us and strengthens their 

conception of the party. Trotsky at any rate was practiced in the leadership of revolution. The Transitional Program and particularly the conversations preceding it are sufficient indication of his pro found comprehension of the mass movement. But as this whole document has shown, he gave it no theoretical basis. He did not relate it to the new stage of world economy. The result is the increased revolutionism of the masses becomes nothing else in the minds of his followers but an increased re action to the crimes of capitalism, a mass base for leadership. The theory as stated has had funereal consequences in our movement. Germain, for example, writes in an exhaustive analysis of the Stalinist parties : "But despite all that has been revealed about the crimes of the GPU, the large mass of Stalinist workers will continue to follow their Stalinist leaders or will fall back into com plete passivity - until the day when the Trotskyist parties can prove to them in practice the superiority of their policy over the policy of Stalinism ." (Fourth International, May, 1 947.) In the resolution presented to the World Congress in 1 948 by our European co-thinkers, there was pointed out in detail the practical consequences for politics of this concep tion of the party which constantly appears in the strategy and tactics of the Fourth International, particularly in France. It is the placing of this impossible , this fantastic, responsibility upon the Trotskyist organizations as they are that in the end produces Pablo . 5 9 VII 

METHODOLOGY 

# !9 HE MOST COMPLETE EXPRESSION of Stalinist 

# \1/1 theory (and of any theory) is its methodology. Method ology is the result of the complex interaction of social base, theoretical analysis and practical activity, and the struggles with rival forces and rival methodologies. As it matures, it is transformed from effect into cause and in the end it is insep arable from the activity, practical and theoretical, of those who develop it. 

> Stalinism and Leninism

(a) The methodology of Stalinism is a methodology foretold by Marx, a combination of uncritical positivism and uncritical idealism. Its roots in bourgeois philosophy we shall take up later. The uncritical positivism is its gross material ism, its quantitative theory and practice of accumulation; its uncritical idealism is its theory of the role of intellectuals, the Plan and the party. For such a theory, serious theoretical analysis of social phenomena is impossible. It knows no other way of achieving its aims than the method of the decadent bourgeoisie, empiri cism and violence. Its theory, from the theory of ineffective demand to its analysis of the Negro question in the United States, every move in Russia, is the result and expression of empiricism and then a search in the closet of Marxism for something that will fit. If nothing is found, a new garment is 60 created, and the Marxist label attached. Its most glaring failure is the analysis of its own and rival movements. The analysis is entirely subjective. Stalinism inherits from Lenin the theory that the Second International was the international based upon super-profits of monopoly capitalism. There for Stalinism analysis ceases. The Stalinists in harmony with their whole analysis of Russian social rela �

tions, are simply the most honest, the most devoted, the most intelligent, enemies of capitalism and lovers of social ism. Leaders are sincere or they betray, due to malice, error, ill-intention, cowardice, bribery or corruption. Workers understand or they do not understand. As a rule, they do not understand, being corrupted by capitalist decay and the plots and deceptive propaganda of the bourgeoisie. Every crime of Stalinism against Leninism, Popular Front, the Wallace movement, the refusal to orient toward the seizure of proletarian power - all have the one ideologi cal base, the theory that the workers are incapable of under standing or acting. This is not mere hypocrisy. The Stalinist method is in origin and results truly capitalist, in the last stage of capitalism . In Russia and outside it is the same. Moscow trials, vilification o f political opponents as thieves, agents provocateurs, etc., are part of the system. Stalinism aims at the subordination of the mass, its demoralization and confusion, the destruction of its capacity to think , its conver sion into a large diSciplined force able to trust no one or look anywhere else but to the party. Stalinism carries on a deafen ing agitation for mass action on separate issues which create no organic change in the qualitative relation of labor to capital. It seeks to substitute for the workers' accumulation of their historical experiences, immediate action on every occasion through committees organized and led by the party apparatus. It seeks to place the masses as much at the dispos al of the party as the proletariat is at the disposal of capital. (b) The most striking opposition to this methodology is Leninism between 1 9 1 4 and 1 923. The gigantic labors of 6 1 1 9 1 4-1 7 were aimed at finding .a material base for the failure of the Social-Democracy to make any resistance to the im 

perialist war. Lenin began with an analysis of the specific 

stage of world capitalism, the basis of every Marxist method ology. In Imperialism he traced the specific mode of produc tion, concentration, the role of colonies, the super-profits. These super-profits were the basis of the creation of a labor aristocracy, the specific labor organization of capitalism at a specific stage . The very structure of imperialism was, as he endlessly repeated , a transition to something higher; a higher form. The proletariat was inherently revolutionary and its revolutionary struggle for democracy was intensified by the oppression and the organization imposed upon it by capitalism itself. This 

was the basis of the foundation of the Third InternationaL Without this theory, he insisted, "not the slightest progress" could be made . He repudiated attributing political activity on any comprehensive scale to "malice" or "evil intention. " Nor did he make speculations about consciousness. The actual movement to the seizure of power was one thing, but revolu tionary consciousness and desires were the product of the stage of capitalism itself. Leninist Methodology Today 

Today, where must a Leninist methodology begin? The Fourth International as opposed to the Third can only be the product of a new stage of capitalism which has corrupted the International based upon a previous stage. This new stage we have analyzed as state-capitalism or statification of production . Without this, the International is as helpless as Lenin's Third would have been without his analysis o f monopoly capitalism . 

A correct methodology does not begin in a vacuum . It seeks in the Leninist analysis contained in Imperialism the 

62 

tendencies which indicated the future developments, in this case, state-capitalism. Lenin, as Marxists always do, drew them sharply to their conclusion. The concrete facts lagged behind the theory. But because his method was irreproach able, he foresaw that in the coming period state-monopoly capitalism would end in "vast state-capitalist trusts and syndicates," that is to say, the centralizations of capital on a world scale. We live in that epoch today. Upon these indications and using his method we seek the differences. Thus in the resolution of our co-thinkers submitted to the World Congress in 1 94 8 , The World Political Situation and the Fourth International, it was stated : "Leninism in World War I analyzed the development o f international capitalist monopolies which shared the world among themselves. "In 1 948 the movement to the centralization of capital has reached such gigantic proportions that only vast state capitalist trusts and syndicates on a continental and inter continental scale (Hitler's Europe, Stalinist domination of Europe and Eastern Asia, Marshall Plan, Molotov Plan, etc.) can attempt to control it . Combinations of individual capital ists from different states, organized in cartels for world com bination of separate or related industries, now are - and cannot be otherwise than a minor part of world economy. " Leninism in World War I taught that the world was completely shared out, so that in the future only redivision was possible. "In 1 948 there is no question of division or redivision of the world-market. The question is posed in terms of complete mastery of the world by one of two great powers, Russia or the United States. "Leninism in World War I taught that the export of capital has become decisive as distinguished from the export of commodities, owing to the fact that capital in a few coun tries had become over-ripe and needed to seek a higher rate of profit in colonial countries. 

63 "In 1 948 finance capital does not export surplus capital to seek higher profit. World economy now patently suffers from a shortage of capital and an incapacity to create it in sufficient quantities to reconstruct Europe and to keep production expanding. The distinction is symbolized in the qualitative difference between the Dawes Plan and the Marshall Plan. "Capital therefore tends toward centralization on aworld scale. But the tendency toward centralization on a world scale and with it, the end of the world-market and of capitalist society, can be achieved only by force, i.e., the struggle for mastery between two great masses of capital, one under the control of the United States and the other under the control of Russia." 

It is here that everything begins. The tendency is the tendency to centralization on aworld scale. The tendency to centralization on a world scale can only take place by conflict between two large masses of capital. No longer cartels and distant colonies but contiguous masses of capital must be accumulated, either directly as Hitler tried to do and Stalin is doing, or through control of the state power, as the United States aims to do in Europe. It is this double tendency of attraction and repulsion which created the necessity of state-capitalism. The state takes over the economy, both in preparation for resisting other economies and for allying itself to the other mass of capital to which it is attracted or forced. National capital must deal with national capitaL At the same time the falling rate of profit on a world scale creates tendencies within each individual economy, both in the bureaucratic economy and, opposed to it, in the mass movement of the proletariat which is characteristic of state-capitalism. These are the specific conditions which produce the modern bureaucracy.

The Bodyguard of Capital Upon this analysis our co-thinkers in Europe in their 

1 948 resolution wrote : "In the epoch of World War II the labor bureaucracy has undergone a qualitative development. It is no longer the 'main social support' of the bourgeoisie . Such is the bank ruptcy of bourgeois society that it can continue only because the labor b ureaucracy has increasingly substituted itself for the bourgeoisie in the process of production itself and in the bureaucratic administration of the capitalist state. To adegree only haltingly and quite inadequately recognized b y t h e Fourth International before the war and today, the bureaucratic leadership of the labor movement as embodied in the Communist Parties has long recognized the bankruptcy of bourgeois society, ground between the crisis in production and the growing revolt of the proletariat, the great masses of the people and the colonial masses. The bureaucracy of the Communist Parties of Europe, even before the war, sought and still seeks a new economic and social base for the main tenance and consolidation of its power over the proletariat. It is bourgeois to the core, in its terror of the proletarian revolution, in its inability to place the solution of the eco nomic and political problems of society in the creative power of the proletariat , and in its fear of rival imperialisms. The mass of Russian capital, the Kremlin and the Stalinist Army serve it all a base from which it hopes to administer central ized European state-capitalism. With this in view it repudiates both the bourgeois national state and b ourgeois private prop erty. It is not in any sense social-patriotic. It collaborates with the bourgeoisie or attacks it , in peace or in war, gov erned entirely by its' immediate perspective of centralizing European capital under the aegis of Russian capital as the first stage in the struggle for world domination. In this sense its allegiance to the Kremlin is absolute . But it is essentially a product of the bankruptcy of private property and the 

65 national state on a world scale, on the one hand, and the revolutionary pressure of the masses, on the other hand." It was pointed out that the Second International today is far closer to the bureaucracy of the Third International than it is to classic Social-Democracy. 

"As a result of the war, the Second International, though by tradition unsuited for the violent character of the modern class struggle , follows in essence the same basic orien-, tation toward centralized capital. It is distinguished from the Third International by; in general, the loss of any real basis in the revolutionary proletariat, and its timidity in the face of the native bourgeoisie. In important elements it aims at the attachment of the national economy to the power ofAmerican capital. But not only in Eastern Europe where the immediate power of Russia is overwhelming, but even in Italy under the pressure of the masses and imminent economic bankruptcy, it is ready to unite with the Communist Party, i.e., attach itself to Russian capitaL" The resolution also analyzed the petty-bourgeoisie upon the basis of the analysis of state-capitalism : 

"The labor bureaucracy of the Second International was always fortified by the petty-bourgeoisie. Today the enor mous growth of bureaucracy in the administration of capital, in the unions with their constantly expanding functions, and above all in the government, has created a huge administra tive caste without which the social and economic existence of capital on a world scale would be impossible . The process of fusion between the labor bureaucracy and this petty-bour geois administrative caste has added a new quality to the alliance between them which characterizes the period o f World War II. This force constitutes the real social agency of capitalism today. Like all phenomena, the role of this body guard of capital varies according to specific need, more pre cisely, the national stage of economic bankruptcy and the revolutionary pressure of the masses. Its economic ideas are based upon the administrative concept of 'planned economy.' 

66 

Its chief task is the subordination or corruption and blunting of the revolutionary will of the proletariat . Its basic power rests upon its control of the labor movement in the process of production itself where it is best able to check the revolu tionary proletariat and preserve bourgeois society." This is Leninism for our epoch: objective analysis of the 

specific stage of capitalist development, objective analysis of the social basis of the counter-revolutionary International, and opposed to it , of the revolutionary International. And Orthodox Trotskyism? What is the methodology of orthodox Trotskyism? It is to be judged by its results. It has never recognized the neces sity for an analysis of the present stage of world economy. Because it never emancipated itself from the simple repetition of the facts of Lenin's Imperialism , it cannot get away from seeing Stalinism as reformism. Under these circumstances there is no escape whatever from subjectivism . It can offer no explanation as to why the Stalinists behave as they do. All it can attribute Stalinist practice to is evil, malice, or ill intentions, stupidity and ignorance, supple spines, tools of the Kremlin. When it is recognized that the Stalinists are not only that, the result is Pablo. The subjectivity of the Trotskyist analysis of Stalinism is rooted in the unrej ected premise that the Stalinists are social-patriotic collaborators with their own bourgeoisi e . Its catastrophic results can be seen in the Manifesto of 1 940 

when Trotsky faced for a few short weeks the fact that the French Stalinists had displayed a "sudden defeatism ." As long as Trotskyism believed that the Stalinists would collabo rate with their bourgeoisie, it could reserve for itself the idea that there was a fundamental distinction between the two Internationals. Now that events have destroyed that belief, Trotskyism is reduced to epithets. 

67 The Fourth International is unable in objective material ist terms to find the reasons for its own existence. If it had, its present crisis over Eastern Europe would never have arisen. The documents of the Fourth International are there to prove this. It was founded upon the basis that the Commu nist International was unable to learn or be taught any more (this same idea is in the Transitional Program ; see our quote , page 4 ) , a n d that the proletariat from the experience of Ger many would turn away from the Comintern and toward the Fourth InternationaL New Internationals are not founded upon the basis of the inability of the old International to learn. This mode of reasoning led to the expectation that after defeat in Germany in 1 93 3 , the Communist Interna tional would decline. The analysis was purely subj ective. Actually, it was precisely the defeat in Germany in 1 933 

that strengthened Stalinism . It crystallized the conviction growing in Europe that the mass revolt of the proletariat and its control of industry in the Marxist and Leninist manner were a dream. It led to the conclusion that the model of proletariat organization had to be Stalinist , and that this was the only means whereby the capitalism of private property with its crises and Fascism could be opposed. It is this that had strengthened the elements in the labor movement and the petty-bourgeoisie to make Stalinism what it is. But at the same time it is precisely the experiences which strengthened Stalinism which have created in the proletariat the tendencies to mass mobilization for total emancipation · and the creation of a mass party which will run both industry and state. These in turn strengthen the dictatorial tendencies of Stalinism. All this is based upon economic analysis, new stages, new social responses to state-capitalism. Otherwise you have to base your new International, this colossal conception, on the fact that the old International will not "learn. " In that kind of reasoning, consciousness determines existence, the existence of an organization which is to lead the greatest 

68 

overturn history knows. The inability to analyze Stalinism in the light of Lenin ist analysis of the present stage of capitalism cripples ortho dox Trotskyism at every turn. Its analysis leans heavily on the concept of Bonapartism . The concept not only illumi nates nothing, it obscures the specific stage and disguises the definitive class antagonism . The Bonapartes did not know state-capitalism, the total plan, the modern mass parties. The plan, the party, the state are totally capitalistic. Nazi or Stalinist, they represent capital. The great modern mass parties are either instruments of capital or instruments of the proletarian revolution. There is not the slightest element . of Bonapartism in them. Orthodox Trotskyism can find no obje ctive necessity for an imperialist war between Stalinist Russia and American imperialism. It is the only political tendency in the world which cannot recogniZe that the conflict is a struggle between two powers for world mastery. It is therefore reduced to substituting subjective agitation against war-mongers and profiteers, on the one hand, and attacks on Stalin for deals with imperialism, on the other. Orthodox Trotskyism is unable because of its concep tion of state-property and its subjective analysis of the coming war to make the simplest distinction between the counter-revolutionary Third International and the revolu tionary Fourth International : namely, that in war the former will be for one camp ; the latter will be for the overthrow of both. The Fourth International today evades making this distinction by posing war as "an unlikely eventuality." Meanwhile , it puts forward both contradictory positions, alternately or simultaneously. 

> The Economism of Orthodox Trotskyism

Orthodox Trotskyism can merely call for a revolution 

69 in Russia. Its theory affords no objective basis for it, none. It aimed to dig a gulf between the proletariat and the bu reaucracy, analyzing the proletariat alone as organically attached to state-property. With the defense of state-property by the bureaucracy, the basic Trotskyist distinction is lost. Orthodox Trotskyism finds some base for a Russian Revolution in the "socialist consciousness" of the workers, i.e., the memories of the October Revolution. This is totally false. The socialist consciousness of the proletariat is rein forced by the October Revolution, but it is based upon the growing revolt and the unity, organization and discipline which is the product of Russian production. So far is objec tive analysis lost that the impetus for the revolution of the Russian proletariat is now handed over entirely to agencies outside : 

"A new revolutionary selection, carried by a new mass upsurge, which can only be the result of a powerful revolu tionary wave outside of Russia, will alone be able to restore to the proletariat a clear consciousness of its historic mis sion." (Fourth International, June, 1 948, p. 1 1 3.) 

This is true only if you base your analysis upon con sumption. The Russian proletariat will have to overthrow the most powerful army, state and secret police the world has ever known, to take control of production. This orthodox Trot skyism calls a political revolution, and tries to teach the workers in other countries that they have a greater task before them . The error is as old as the opposition to Leninism. It is economism. The economists of World War I refused to sup port the revolt of oppressed nations because this would destroy centralization of economic forces which was pro gressive. Lenin fought them tooth and nail as he had fought the economists of Russia two decades before. Revolutionary struggles produced by a world-wide stage of economic de velopment cannot destroy that development. Orthodox 

70 

Trotskyism has never ceased to see in the kulaks, in the destruction of the party, in primitive accumulation, in war, in the restoration of religion, the source of a return to private property in Russia. This is economism at its extreme . Private property has not been restored because the whole tendency of world economy is in exactly the opposite direction. The strength of state-property is in the increased centralization and the vastly increased and socialized proletariat. To pose the attack on the bureaucracy by the proletariat in wartime as endangering state-property and national independence is to attribute to the bureaucracy a responsibility for state property and Russian independenge greater than that of the proletariat. It is to say that even the revolutionary proletariat of Russia is incapable, without the bureaucracy, of defending Russia and preserving state-property. On this reasoning the October Revolution would never have taken place. 

Orthodox Trotskyism and the Colonial Revolts 

Our final example of the inability of the Trotskyist methodology which refuses to recognize state-capitalism is the present plight of Trotskyism on the specific theory of the permanent revolution itself in relation to the colonies. The specific theory of the permanent revolution in relation to the colonies was based on: 

1 . Monopoly capital exporting surplus capital to the colonial countries and industrializing them, the stage of capitalism analyzed by Lenin. 

2. In this relation the native bourgeoisie would play a comprador role, collaborating with the imperialist powers. 

3. The class struggle of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie and the foreign capitalists in the industrialized areas would give it the role of leader in the national struggle . The proletariat would lead the peasantry in the agrarian revolution and thereby split the petty-bourgeoisie from 

7 1 collaboration with the native bourgeoisie and foreign monop oly capitaL However, since the depression of 1 929 and the emer gence of state-capitalism on a world scale : 

1 . The struggle is not for redivision of colonies but for world mastery. World capitalism lives not by export of capital but by its centralization. (a) In the struggle for world mastery by large masses of centralized capitals, advanced countries formerly exporting capital to the colonies (France , England, Holland) are re duced to satellites of American capitalism , living on the Marshall Plan and desperate efforts to increase capital by import and further exploitation of the proletariat at horne. (b) State loans made to the regimes of colonial coun tries are not used for the purpose of industrialization but for the maintenance of military outposts of the world struggle . 

2 . Under these conditions the continued destruction of the old feudal and handicraft economy in the country side, going on for nearly a century, is not supplanted by any development of the industrial economy. The result is that the peasant revolts become a continuous phenomenon (uninterruptedly in China for over 20 years). Under these changed conditions, the theory of orthodox Trotskyism about China that the peasant revolts were merely remnants of proletarian struggle and would arise only after new stimulation from the proletariat, has been outmoded by the new stage of world capitalism. These revolts, plus the world imperialist struggle , transform the national govern ments of the feudal landlords and native bourgeoisie, even with military support by American capitalism, into anach ronisms with no perspective of national rule. 

3 . The new situation radicalized the urban petty bourgeoisie. Instead of collaborating with the bankrupt bourgeoisie and remnants of foreign monopoly capital, many elements hostile to private property leave the cities to lead and control the peasant revolts. In fact, they become 

72 

colonial representatives of Russian centralized capital, cadres of the Stalinist parties with relations to the revolting masses and to the power of Russia similar to those of the European Stalinists, modified but not essentially altered by their historical conditions. 

4. Where, as in China, the urban petty-bourgeoisie comes to power at the head of the peasant revolt, it achieves the national independence, within the context of the inter national power of Stalinist Russia. Within this context, it will seek to : (a) expropriate the private property of the national bourgeoisie and foreign capital ; (b) develop cadres of the petty-bourgeoisie to admin ister the one-party bureaucratic-administrative state of the Plan ; (c) carry out thereby the intensified exploitation of the proletariat in production ; (d) solve not one single problem of the agrarian rev olution, which requires a complete reorganization of the economy on an international socialist basis. In India, not the petty-bourgeoisie but Indian capital has been able to take advantage of the changed world condi tions, and achieve the national independence. It is threatened by the Stalinist party which seeks to duplicate the triumph in China. The bankruptcy of the national economy lends strength to the Stalinists. Such, in summary outline, is the analysis . Conflicts will arise , the Stalinists in the colonies may succeed or fail, com pletely or partially. Such is the new theoretical orientation required. Orthodox Trotskyism, on this fundamental ques tion of its own past, here as elsewhere, is unable to solve one of the problems raised. It cannot analyze the new stage in world economy where centralization is so powerful that it achieves national independence in the colonies, using one class if another is not ready but thereby multiplying all the antagonisms and social crises. 

73 VIII LENINISM AND THE TRANSITIONAL REGIME 

# Ii1I' HERE REMAINS NOW the summation of our theory 

# \V I. - what we consider to be Leninism for our epoch. It is best explained in terms of Leninism itself in its own epoch. It is the only experience we have of the party, the plan, the state in action. During the revolution Lenin stated that the proof that Russia was ripe for Socialism was in the creation of Soviets by the proletariat , the creation of an historic organization for the expression of its creative energies. If the Soviets had not been created, Lenin would have held to his old doctrine of the bourgeois revolution. 

Lenin complained in the first years of the revolution that the workers were not administering the state. Lenin complained that the state was bureaucratically deformed and called upon the party to assist the working class to be able to defend itself against its own state. Lenin at a certain stage in the Russian Revolution stated that the party was not controlling the state and the state was running away with them and he didn't know where this monstrosity was going. Today we know or ought to. He warned the country and the party that the few Communists in Russia were lost amid the vast number of bourgeois functionaries o f the old regime. Lenin recognized the need for individual management in the sense of petty-bourgeois functionaries and subordina tion in industry to a single wilL But he drew a harsh line between the proletariat and the Bolshevik Party, on the one 

74 

hand, and those whom the Stalinists and Titoists call the "socialist intelligentsia." 

In Left Wing Communism he pointed out that absolute ly the most difficult task of all tasks for the proletariat and its party was the conversion of the petty-bourgeois intelli gentsia into loyal and disciplined servants of the proletariaf state. The petty-bourgeoisie, to whose individualism Lenin referred in 1 920 as being in direct opposition to the aims and methods of the proletariat, is today infinitely more danger ous. The petty-bourgeois has transferred his individualism into "collectivism" which he understands to be statified production, administration and plan, and is now the firm ally o f the labor bureaucracy of capital, the plan, against the revolutionary proletariat. The essence of Leninism may be summed up as follows : 

1 . The state was necessary for the destruction of the exploiters. But this state was a danger to the proletariat. It was the task of the party to protect the proletariat against the state and "to utilize state measures for the purpose of protecting the material and spiritual interests of the entirely organized proletariat from the state." 

2. The backwardness of the Russian economy and the predominance of the peasantry imposed upon Russian production the necessity for the leadership of technicians, bureaucrats, planners, etc. But in the same way that the proletariat had to be protected against its own state, the proletariat had also to be protected against the necessary bureaucracy. This was the beginning and end of Leninist policy. You understand nothing about the Russian Revolu tion and the problems of the proletariat, the party and the state, unless you understand this. These were the problems that could be resolved only by merging them into the world and particularly the Euro pean socialist revolution. Lenin always sought for initiative. It was initiative which he sought in 1 92 1 by the NEP, and to the very last, 

7 5 in his insistence on the significance of cooperatives. The following quotation exemplifies how he proposed to struggle against the dangers that threatened the Soviet order: "We possess profound sources of strength, a broad and deep reservoir of human material, such as is not possessed, and never will be possessed, by any bourgeois government. We have material upon which we can draw ever more deeply, by passing from the advanced workers, not only to the aver age workers, but even lower to the t oiling peasants, to the poor and poorest peasants. Comrades from Petrograd were recently saying that Petrograd has given all its political work ers and cannot give more. But when the critical hour struck, Petrograd , as Comrade Zinoviev justly remarked, proved magnificent, it seemed to be a city which was giving birth to new forces. Workers who appeared to be below the average level, who had no state or political experience whatsoever, rose to their full height and provided numerous forces for propaganda, agitation and organization, and performed mir acle after miracle. Our source of miracles is still very great." This is the Leninist policy, the basic policy which applies to every question of transitional regime. The concrete circumstances will differ, but the less powerful the situation of the proletariat, the more necessary, particularly after thirty years, becomes the Leninist policy. That is the decisive t est and not abstract arguments about whether the country is ready for socialism. The application of this Leninist policy is not a question for the future, after the difficulties of the transitional regime have been solved . It is the first step of revolutionary policy, from the very beginning, from the moment of the conquest of power. This was Lenin's conception of the transitional regime, and this is what Trotsky, quoting Lenin on the struggle against officialdom , described as Lenin's policy : "You must not think that Lenin was talking about the problems of a decade. No, this was the first step with which 

> 76

'we should and must begin upon achieving a proletarian revolution.' '' (The R evolution Betrayed, p. 50, emphasis in original.) This also is the reason for Lenin's emphasis on the world proletariat. To anybody who saw the proletariat as Lenin did in relation to its own proletarian state and its own bureauc racy, the revolution of the proletariat in the advanced coun tries was an imperative necessity. The idea that the Yugoslav leaders are going to learn from books that the world revolu tion is necessary, which they didn't know before, illuminates what orthodox Trotskyism thinks of the theory of socialism in a single country. If the Yugoslav leaders saw the proletariat with the eyes of those trying to lead the workers' state in re lation to the rest of the population, not books but the neces sity of preserving the workers' state would have driven them to the world revolution long before the break with Stalin. The Leninist policy is dialectical to the core. It is based upon a brutal recognition of the contradictions within the workers' state. It is permeated with the spirit of the revolu tionary proletariat : the revolutionary mobilization of the masses against the bourgeoisie in the first stage. Then when the workers' state had been established, to protect against the inevitable encroachments and invasions by its own state, the independence and creative initiative of the proletariat which had begun by creating the soviets. Lenin's mastery of dialectic, his conviction that social ism could be created only by an emancipated proletariat, enabled him to discover the contradiction and outline revolu tionary policy when the majority of his colleagues, it is clear, had no conception that such a contradiction could exist. To day there is no excuse. The maturity of state-capitalism has brought the contradiction which Lenin sensed into the open. This dominates our epoch. Without the Leninist conception, thoroughly mastered, you end in active uncritical support of the bureaucratic-administrative one-party state. The proof is Yugoslavia.

IX 

YUGOSLAVIA 

# ft1IV E HAVE TO REMIND orthodox Trotskyism that it 

# IJ.! " did not support the European movement for national liberation when the m asses were in motion. Now it proposes to support the national state of Yugoslavia in the struggle for national independence against the Kremlin. This is the state which suppressed the mass movement, subordinated it to the movements of the Russian Army and kept it from making contact with the European mass movement. The policy stands on its head. In reality it is the criterion o f state�property which explains this consistently false policy. Unless it is a question of nationalized property vs. private property, orthodox Trotskyism cannot see and interpret the movement of the proletariat. The moment nationalized property is involved , it starts looking for the mass pressures and actions to explain this nationalization. Compare with this the policy of "Johnson�Forest." Whereas in 1 94 3 the Shachtmanites plunge d headlong into the liberation movement under the slogans of struggle for democracy and national independence , "Johnson-Forest" took the position that the proletariat and the party should enter the national liberation movement and struggle for proletarian power under the general slogan of the Socialist United States o f Europe. * Thus, right from the beginning,

w e posed the struggle inside the Yugoslav movement against the national policy of Titoism . That is still the basis of our position today. For orthodox Trotskyism, on the other hand, then as now, the Socialist United States of Europe remains an abstraction. The International is now busily debating when the revolution took place in Yugoslavia. Characteristically, it does not occur to the debaters to ask themselves how this highly exceptional, extremely silent revolution took place unnoticed by the leaders of the revolutionary movement. That would be bad enough. But in 1 945 or 1 946 or 1 947 

(etc., etc.) this revolution presumably took place unnoticed by the proletariat in the surrounding countries of Europe and the rest of the world. However, what concerns us now is the situation in Yugoslavia. Extensive documents have been published by the Com� munist Party of Yugoslavia (CPY) itself. "Johnson-Forest" do not for one single moment take these documents as true representations of the history of Yugoslavia for the last ten years. As well accept the documents of Stalinist bureaucrats as the history of Russia. But they are the basis of the politics and discussion of all tendencies. in the Fourth International today. We accept them therefore to the degree that in them� selves, they represent, if not the history of Yugoslavia on the whole, a clear representation of the theory and politics of the Yugoslav leaders. Titoism is pure conscious consistent Stalinism . Having a model in both the theory and practice of Russia already established , Titoism has been able to achieve in a few short years the counter�revolutionary climax which it took Stalin nearly two decades to accomplish. Stalin had to struggle against the traditions and remnants not of capitalism but of Leninism. Tito began as a finished Stalinist. 

7 9 The Trade Unions in Yugoslavia Stalinism in Russia provided the CPY with the model for disciplining the workers by transforming the trade unions from organs of struggle by the workers into organs of mobili zation of the workers to speed up production. The CPY explains why it destroyed the trade unions as militant class organizations of the working class: "Under the conditions in the new Yugoslavia, after the nationalization of industry, and as a result of the quick tempo of socialist building, the workers' class is no longer a class of bare-handed proletarians which must fight a daily political and economic struggle , which must fight for more bread . This class today - in alliance with the other working masses holds the authority - holds the greater part of the means of production, and its future depends in the first place on itself, on its work, and on its unity with other toilers, on the mobilization of all toilers in socialist building." This is the exact opposite of Leninism. It is pure Stalin ism. The independence of the working class, its struggles to protect its material and spiritual interests, its leadership of the other working masses, its determination o f policy - all these are the mortal enemy of the one-party bureaucratic administrative state and in the sacred name of nationalized property, all these are to be destroyed. To achieve this statification o f the trade unions, the CPY "liquidated the old guild-like dispersion of the union organizations, united manual and intellectual workers into one organization, and mobilized them in the building of the country, in the building o f socialism." This unity o f manual and intellectual workers is a sure sign of the Labor Front of the "corporate state." It is a means of subordinating the workers to the petty-bourgeois intellectuals and administrators. Management spies, Stak hanovites, time-study men - the whole apparatus of super vision and domination is brought into the trade unions. They 

80 

become the representatives of the state inside the unions. The trade unions then have the task to "develop the new rela tionship of the working class and the working masses in general toward work . . . organize socialist competition and shockwork, rationalization and innovation . . . fight for work discipline, to improve the quality of work, to guard the people's property, to struggle against damage, against absen teeism, against careless work and similar things ." While carrying on these disciplinary functions the trade unions are "to explain to the working masses that such a struggle is in their own interests, in the interest of the work ing masses in general. " Cripps and Attlee, in capitalist Britain, would consider three-f(;mrths of their troubles solved if they could instruct the British labor unions, suitably poisoned with "socialist intelligentsia," to carry out the economic plans of the state. Tito, the Stalinist in the one-party bureau cratic administrative state, considers that it is his right to instruct the trade unions accordingly, and all because the property is state-owned. The Titoists leave the workers in no uncertainty as to what all this means. It is resistance to speed up which is in volved . "It is necessary to point out that in many trade union organizations there are still many remnants of social-demo cratic conceptions and opportunism which is manifested on the one hand in resistance to fulfilment o f the plan and in resistance to realistic norms, to competition, and on the other hand in exaggerated demands in regard to pay. " To these miserable elements no mercy will b e shown. As in Stalinist Russia, the basis has been laid for war to the end against them by placing them in the realm of social democratic, i.e., capitalist ideology, in opposition to socialist building. They are the enemy. The organizers of increased production, on the other hand, are the cadres. These have caught on quickly because as the whole history of industry shows, that is not hard to learn. In fact (this was written by Kardelj in 1 948), they had 

8 1 too "correctly grasped the organizing role of the trade unions in production ." "In practice, in carrying out the economic organizational tasks of the trade unions, our trade union cadres often go to extremes." They "forgot" certain "other equally important tasks ." And what did they forget? They simply forgot "concern for the welfare of the workers, struggle for better living conditions for them and work on the political elevation of the working masses." And why is such forgetfulness harmful and why must it be corre cted? Is it because only by this means will a new economy superior to capitalism be developed? Not at all. It is because not to be concerned about these things would weaken the respect of the proletariat for the state authority. The trade unions are the "direct organizers of the strug gle of the working class for the increase in production." But "the workers must feel that their trade union organization is concerned with their welfare." Imagine the denunciations that would fall from orthodox Trotskyism on the head of Reuther if he dared to say, as indeed he w ould not at this stage, that it is the business of Reutherite cadres to make the workers "feel" that the union is concerned with their welfare and working conditions. But transfer private property into state-property , and forthwith this becomes "proletarian policy. " This is Stalinism and nothing else but Stalinism . Lenin insisted on the need for the proletariat to protect itself against its own state. The CPY labels resistance by the proletariat to fulmment of the plan as "incorrect," "W1-friendly," "backward ." This is typical Stalinist phraseology and in Russia is accompanied by keeping millions in the forced labor camps where these backward elements are "re-educated." The Titoists ask for "healthy criticism by the working masses through the mass organizations as regards the work of the state organs, economic and social institutions, etc." The phrasing is accurate and well-chosen. Individual workers and groups of workers must not complain. They can only criticize through the mass organizations, i .e., through 

82 

the trade union cadres. Resistance to speed up, for example, leads to the conclusion that one "does not want to see where the real interests of the working class lie." It is obvious that criticism by such a worker w ould be unhealthy, unhealthy for the state and no doubt unhealthy for this "irresolute," "W1friendly" and "backward" worker. 

The Mode of Labor in Yugoslavia 

Competition is the Titoist method for intensifying the speed of production. Again Stakhanovism in Stalinist Russia provided the model for the CPY. On New Year's Eve in 1 947 Marshall Tito boasted that "this spirit of competition has begun to penetrate into our state administration and other institutions as well." The bureaucracy introduced its own special type of incentive pay. By great activity in speed up and shockwork, a worker could get out of the proletariat altogether and join the bureaucracy. As the Titoists explain : "Factory and workshop department heads, and often directors of factories and enterprises are being culled from the ranks of shockworkers." The factory directors selected in this manner provided the nucleus for the stratification in production, formalized in the New Five-Year Plan of 1 947. Again the administrative plan of Stalinist Russia provided the model. The CPY con sciously organizes production according to the principle o f the hierarchy in production which, a s w e have explained, Marx analyzed as the heart of capitalist authority. In intro ducing the Five-Year Plan it writes : "Planned economy of itself imposes the need of aplanned distribution of labor-power, the planned training and development of technical cadres." The creation of "our people's, our socialist intelligent sia," which Stalin had to wait until the 1 936 Constitution to systematize , is organized by Tito after a few years o f power. 

83 Article 1 4 of the New Five-Year Plan of 1 947 is entitled "Work and Cadres." It reads : " 1 . To ensure a steady increase in the productivity of work by introducing the greatest possible mechanization, new methods of work, new technological processes and norms of work, by improving the qualifications of the work ers, and by thoroughly utilizing working hours." (Emphasis added.) There must be no waste of time o f the workers at work. The passage goes on to repeat the Stalinist theory with regard to the intensification of the rate of exploitation : " . . . thus creating the conditions for an increase of wages and better remuneration for workers of all categories. In connection with this to perfect a system of progressive payments for work over and above the norm, as well as asystem for premia f or engineering and technical staf fs, for the fulfilment of the plan." (Emphasis added.) Not only the planning of incentive pay for the workers. Planning of incentive pay also to the bureaucracy in order to inspire them to intensify the exploitation of the workers. The Plan calls for special training of an expanded administrative cadre: 

"3 . to ensure the increase of the cadres with secondary professional training from 65 ,000 in 1 946 to 1 50,000 in 1 95 1 , effecting this by opening new technical secondary schools and enlarging existing ones . . . . 

> "

4 . to ensure an increase in the number of experts with university qualifications to an average of 5 ,000 annually . . . . To carry out a planned enrolment in all faculties and profes sional schools, thus providing the most important sectors with the necessary cadres." For Yugoslavia as for Stalinist Russia, this social in equality is not a question of enjoying cultural privileges over and above those of the workers. The purpose of the Plan is to "direct all technically trained intelligentsia toward creative work," i.e . , to devise new methods for the administration of 84 the proletariat against the very conditions of large-scale pro duction. The Titoists, having enunciated the magic phrase, state-property, think they have no such problems. The political economy of Titoism is the political econ omy of Stalinism . Stalinist theory within the last decade, for reasons that we have explained, has developed the idea that the law of value also exists in socialism. The CPY follows this faithfully, claiming that the law of value is "fully under control" be cause there is "state control" and "market regulation." Like the Stalinists, they claim that there is "no surplus value in the socialist sector" because there is no private appropriation of surplus labor. Then comes a remarkable sentence. We are told : "Surplus labor has the odd property that it can be materialized in new instruments of labor which make for greater productivity in labor: hence a spiral tendency." The Marxist general law of capitalist accumulation con sists precisely of the terrible effects upon the proletariat and ultimately upon production of this very "spiral tendency" of "surplus labor." The "oddity" of this surplus labor under capitalism, as distinguished from previous societies, is pre cisely its materialization into instruments of labor which dominate over the proletariat. Kidric's description of the process as "odd" merely highlights the obvious. The main aim of the bureaucracy is identical with that of the bour geoisie under private property capitalism : the acceleration of this spiral tendency of materializing surplus labor into new instruments of labor for the intensification of the rate of exploitation. At the same time Kidric knows from his Russian model that "socialist accumulation" consists not only of exploita tion, but also of the state "sharing" the workers' wages through taxation. Kidric states that "so long as there is sur plus labor on the one hand . . . and forces of production on the other which are not so developed as t o make it possible to raise the standard of living as we should like to, to build 85 new factories, implements of labor, etc., to the extent and in the place where we should like to, there exists a possibil ity of incorrect usage, a possibility of incorrect distribution of surplus labor." This is not mere talk about economic theory. It is the justification for adding to the exploitation of the workers in the process of production, the most merciless method of taxation the modern world has known. In the New Interna tional of December, 1 942, and January-February, 1 943 , 

Forest has made a study of the turnover tax in Stalinist Russia and has shown how this tax, levied chiefly on con sumption goods of the poor, supplied 60% to 75% of the national budget. The tax was graduated, the highest tax was on bread, leading to a ten-fold increase in the sale price. One of the lowest taxes in the consumption goods field was on silk, and it was a mere one percent on means of production goods. It is upon this model that there was fastened upon the Yugoslav people in 1 947 the turnover tax on goods, a "typi cally socialist form of socialist monetary accumulation tried out in practice in the Soviet Union." As a result of this turn over tax , "state accumulation has grown in 1 947 to 276% 

as compared with 1 946." 

Speed up in production, planned organization of cadres to utilize thoroughly the working hours of the proletariat, accumulation of surplus value, domination of new instru ments of labor over the proletariat this is the mode of pro duction in Yugoslavia ; and from this is inseparable the one party administrative state and the party of the bureaucracy. 

The One-Party Bureaucratic-Administrative State of the Plan 

The Yugoslav Communist Party leaders have known from the beginning that they have one "basic problem - the problem of authority." After the invasion of German Fascism, there never was 

86 

such an opportunity in the world so far in which to establish a genuine Soviet State. But the CPY, faced with the destruc tion of the old bourgeois state and seeing further that it would face the revolutionary proletariat and the revolution ary masses, from the very beginning set out to establish the most powerful bourgeois state that it could. It established "a unified state authority" - "from top to bottom . . . firmly linked into one unified system on the basis of vertical ties between the various branches of state authority and adminis tration and the lower organs, whose duty it is within the framework of the competence of the higher organs to carry out all the tasks which they put before them. " This which Lenin feared is what the CPY sought . They were plotting this as far back as 1 943 . Over and over again they boast that they were the first of the Eastern European countries to achieve the formation of the state apparatus . Marx on the Commune and Lenin in every page of his writings on the Russian Revolution saw as the first task of the revolution the mobilization of the masses as the begin ning of the destruction of all state authority. The strong cen tralized state was necessary only against the exploiters and against the enemy abroad. But in Yugoslavia the exploiters had been destroyed as never before. Yugoslavia was surround ed by friendly states and enjoyed the powerful protection of the Red Army. The powerful state authority was therefore directed against the mass movement and could have been directed against nothing else. It is not only that this state authority expressed the instinctive self-defense of the petty bourgeoisie against the revolutionary proletariat, a lesson which Marxism has spent so many thousands of pages trying to teach. It is that the Titoists had a model. They knew what they wanted. They are Stalinists. They modelled and still model themselves on the one party state, the bureaucratic plan and the party of Stalin. They insist on the differences between the development of Yugoslavia and the Russian R evolution. But they give credit 

87 where credit is due and say that they have been "governed by the rich experiences from the development and work of the authorities of the U.S .S.R." Let orthodox Trotskyism explain this. Any workers ' state, particularly in a small peasant country, in sheer self-defense has to establish the independ ence of the proletariat as the first safeguard of the proletar ian revolution and of the proletarian character of the party. Leninism established this by weighting the vote of the pro letariat 5 to 1 against the vote of the peasantry. Titoism sought from the outset to dissolve the class independence o f the workers in a People's Front . The Titoists tell us them selves how they sought to strengthen "the alliance of the working class with the working peasantry, the people's intel ligentsia and other toilers, and with all patriotic forces within the country, an alliance which was given organizational form in the People's Front. " Note n o w the characteristically Stalinist method o f analysis which we have earlier explained a s based upon the necessity to disguise the class nature of the bureaucracy and the state . The Titoists say that the only people excluded were "anti-people's elements," the category in which Stalin ism has always lumped all those who disagreed with its poli� des. Coalition with political parties played no significant role in this People's Front because with the destruction of the old national bourgeois state apparatus, the objective framework o f the old political parties had been destroyed. This facilitated the Titoist aim of extending the mass base of the movement beyond the working class. Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois elements could enter into the People's Front on an equal basis, unidentified with their old political banners. To destroy the class independence of the workers was to facilitate the control and authority over the workers b y the party. The CPY boasts that "there was no other force outside the CPY which could unite the peoples of Yugoslavia 

8 8 

and the working m asses." The Titoists fought "determinedly against too sudden changes which might have narrowed the mass base of the National Liberation uprising." "The basic thing in the People's Front is that it is a broad form o f political organization ." This "eases the realization of the leading role of the Party." From this broad base the Party could recruit the most active, militant and devoted fighters, regardless of class affil iation, to form the cadre and the executive apparatus of the state for the next stage of the counter-revolution. Once the objective basis for class differentiation is buried in the united mass movement, the only basis for differentiation of policy is subjective and opportunistic, behind which loyalty to the party and the bureaucratic apparatus can be disguised as devotion to the proletarian revolution . The type o f "initia� tive ," "activity," "devotion , " "efficiency," "loyalty" re� quired is that which enables the petty-bourgeoisie to rise to the top and administer the rest of the population. Instead of the working class and its vanguard leading the masses , the party cadres selected from the all�inclusive mass movement rule the working class. The party becomes the apparatus for the one-party bureaucratic�administrative state. During the trade union discussion and afterwards, Lenin directed the most violent internal polemic of the whole October Revolution against the bureaucracy and the militar ism which had grown up as a result of the need for mobilizing the whole country as a war m achine. This played a great role in the destruction of proletarian power in the Russian Revo� lution. Precisely these war experiences had obviously assisted the CPY in its frantic attempt to establish the state and the centralized power. The Titoists themselves boast that with the end of the war "the new authority then already had a firm skeleto n , t h e new state apparatus, grown a n d tried in the fires o f war, with new tested cadres which had already attained quite awealth of experience during the war from the work of the 

89 people's authorities on the liberated territory. " This powerful state was the means whereby they would rule the economy. If we want a demonstration of Lenin's thesis that even confiscation without the power of the proletariat means tyranny for the proletariat, we have an example in Yugo slavia . The statification of production was carried out from beginning to end by the bureaucratic-administrative one party state. Even before the final defeat of Nazi Germany, the property of the collaborators was confiscated by the "unified people's authority" at the III Session of the Anti Fascist Council of the National Liberation of Yugoslavia in 

1 944. The steady strengthening of the state apparatus made it possible t o complete nationalization formally in December, 

1 946, by the same means. The workers remained at their benches. The Titoists announce this triumphantly : "Nationalization was well prepared organizationally and was carried out in such a way that sabotage and damage were made impossible. All enterprises in the entire country were taken over on the same day and almost at the same time 

without the stopping ofproductio n . " (Emphasis added.) The Titoists first suppressed the mass movement and then liquidated the bourgeoisie. Following their model, Stalinism, in theory and in prac tice, the Titoists declare that this nationalization is socialism . They say : "The confiscation of property . . . possessed in essence the character of a socialist measure. Why? Firstly, because it was carried out by the people's authority as the authority of the revolutionary working people headed by the working class. Secondly, because confiscated property passed into the hands of the people in general, into the hands of the working people's state as the manager of this property, and therefore it was clear from the outset that it would crystallize into property of a purely socialist type." Note here the careful substitution of the people in general for the revolutionary workers and the immediate substitution o f the state for the people i n generaL 

90 

As in Stalinist Russia, every measure against the workers is justified in the name of socialism, because where the working class - that is to say, the people in general ; that is t o say, the working people's state; that i s to say, the manager o f the property owns the means o f production, the workers have no interest separate and apart from those of the state, which is in reality the manager of the property, which is t o say, the people i n general, etc., etc. 

Stalinism in a Very Single, Very Small, 

Very Backward Country The Fourth International believes that when the Titoists broke with Stalin, Tito thereby began to move to the Left. We stand absolutely bewildered before this kind of Marxism. How could Tito or anyone in his situation move "to the Left"? The Titoist state was modelled upon the Russian Stalinist state. THo had now lost his international connec tions. It was now Yugoslavia pursuing the identical methods of the one-party bureaucratic-administrative state of Plan in a very single, very small, very backward country, confronted by Western imperialism on the one hand, and with the hostil ity of the whole of Stalinist-controlled Eastern Europe facing it on the other. The theory of Trotskyism from the begin� ning had been that it was precisely such circumstances which had driven Stalinist Russia to degeneration. What belief in miracles is it to think that at this time, Tito, professed and practicing Stalinist, would move "to the Left"? The only policy the Titoists could follow was the strengthening of the dictatorship of the one-party, bureaucratic-administrative state of the Plan ; increase in discipline over the workers in order to atone for the difficulties of isolation in the only way that the bureaucracy can ; the accelerated spiral tendency of accumulation to maintain some place of some kind for Yugo slavia on the world market. 

9 1 The Titoists were compelled to accelerate all tendencies they had hitherto followed. But in characteristic Stalinist fashion, they combined this with the most extravagant demagogy. * It is precisely the break with Stalin which has made the Titoist state more Stalinist than ever. In 1 949 a New Law on People's Committees was elab orated. Behind all the phrases on increased participation of the people, one theme dominated. It was the need for "legal ity and discipline within the state administrative apparatus these are the two powerful means for strengthening the state system as a whole. " "Legality and discipline" legality for the state, discipline for the workers. The growth of the Soviet state terrified Lenin. Kardelj 's report on the New Law reaffirms the counter-revolutionary Stalinist thesis that in a socialist state "the administrative apparatus is greatly expanded and becomes more complicat ed." Precisely because the problem is not only regulation and control but economic management, the report repeats with out equivocation the prerogatives in production of the state authority. "It is necessary to combine the administrative sectors as firmly as possible along vertical lines, not only in the sense of subordinating the lower organs to the higher, and seeing to it that the directives of the higher organs are carried out, but also in the sense of making the higher organs more helpful to the lower." The vertical line that is to say, domination of the people's committees by the centralized state. The bureaucracy sought - not like Lenin for new sources of strength among the deep masses of the workers -in its crisis, it sought to strengthen the state authority by new recruitments from those who have shown readiness in the factories to exceed the norms in production.                

> *For every CPY statement about the need to struggle against bureaucracy and for democracy, it is possible to find 20 in the Stalinist documents written at precisely the moment when they were massacring revolutionists.

92 Having now piled up bureaucracy upon bureaucracy in the very vitals of production and politics, the Titoists indulge in the characteristic Stalinist "self-criticism" of bureaucratic tendencies as rudeness, inefficiency, red-tape, etc. A report by Tito in December, 1 946, had already defined bureauc ratism as "different incorrectnesses," among them, "The incorrect attitude toward peoples, often toward the best workers , both manual and intellectual ," "incorrectnesses toward national property, squandering, etc." Kardelj in 1 949 chides the cadres for bureaucratism in the characteristic Stalinist manner. "It is necessary to declare war to the bitter end" against "a bureaucratic soulless and rude attitude toward the citizenry; absence of efforts . . . to improve the appearance of the buildings and premises of the people's committees, etc." Against "bureaucratically minded persons" the criticism and self-criticism of the CPY is wearisomely resolute. It issues decrees for "decentralization ." As long as the bureaucracy has its cadres at the core and head of every factory adminis tration and people's committee, decentralization means the exact opposite of increased democracy and control by the workers. The ground is laid for the competition of factory against factory, as we have described it for Stalinist Russia. The Titoists issue decrees for workers' control of production . O n the basis of "socialist competition," the Stalinist-Titoist mode of labor, workers' control of production is shockwork ers' control of production . For the mass of workers, the perspective is intensified domination by the one-party bureaucratic-administrative state of the Plan. 

> The CPY, the Red Army and the Break with the Kremlin

The Yugoslav state was formed, not because of the European revolution but because of the power of the Red Army. Backing up the CPY was the counter-revolutionary 93 anny which went through Europe, destroying the proletarian revolution, and above all, the very national liberation move ment in Europe which was headed for a proletarian revolu tion, the Polish movement . The Warsaw insurrectionists were beheaded by Stalin and the Red Army. The Yugoslav state 

was formed with the assistance of Stalin and the Red Army. The Yugoslav leaders say so. They say so again and again : "The increasingly strong international role of the USSR opened a perspective to small peoples also of not only being able to liberate themselves from the imperialist chain but of being able to preserve and develop further the revolutionary achievements of the National Liberation War." They cannot minimize the blanket of protection given by the Soviet Union : "The new historic condition in the construction of our socialist economy consists in this in view of the great vic tory of the Soviet Union over German fascism and its efforts to gain world domination, and in view of the inception of the new people's democracies, made possible by the victory of the Soviet Union, our revolution could not be encircled by capitalist neighbors, to the same threatening extent as was the case of the October Revolution ." This is exactly the mentality of Stalinists all over the world. They cannot place the solution of the economic and political problems in the creative power of the proletariat. They are afraid of rival imperialisms. They do not depend on the proletarian revolution on an international scale. They seize the power when the Red Army is at their backs. The break with Stalin made it necessary for the CPY to find another international base to strengthen its hand against the Yugoslav proletariat. "Socialism in a single country" is only secondarily nationalist. Its class essence which it cannot abandon is bureaucratic domination over the proletariat. In this epoch all states must combine defense of their rule over their own proletariat with an international appeal to sec tions of the population in other countries. Yesterday Stalin 94 combined collective security maneuvers with imperialist powers (League of Nations, Fascist Germany, Churchill) with manipulations of the parties of the Comintern. Today, Tito combines his national security deals with American imperialism, participation in the UN and expansionist designs in the neighboring countries, with the call for a new interna tionalism. Every manipulation of the Third International by Stalin serves one purpose, defense of the one-party state and bureaucratic-administrative Plan of the Russian centralization of capital. Tito's present maneuvers in internationalism are a model of imitation. The theory of internationalism is the same in both cases : rally whatever forces are available on an international scale to support "socialist building" in Russia or very backward Yugoslavia and identify this with the advance of the world revolution. The defense of Yugoslavia attracts particularly those seeking an escape from the strangehold of the two great masses of capital, without the world revolu tionary perspective of revolutionary class struggle against the bureaucracy in each country. As we wrote in October, 1 949 : "The essence of the struggle can be seen by its effects upon the world working class movement. Whereas the labor lackeys of the Second International carefully refrained from any assistance to Ethiopia or Republican Spain, they are ready to support the bourgeoisie in stimulation of THo's opposition to Stalin. The past and present of the Titoist party, in the present world crisis, make Tito a pole of attrac tion far more to the supporters of Western imperialism than to the genuinely revolutionary masses." ("No Support to Tito," Internal Bulletin , October, 1 949.) Stalinism has lived and can live only by the perpetual purging of elements in the bureaucracy, particularly those who occupy any prominence. Tito understood quite clearly that carrying out the policy of the Kremlin ends inevitably in one's own neck being in jeopardy. He knew this from his whole past association with the frame-ups and assassinations 95 of the Kremlin, and the events in post-war Eastern Europe were bringing this home to him with a very intimate urgency. This was the position that confronted the Titoist bureaucracy. Does any orthodox Trotskyist deny this? Ob jectively, the Titoist bureaucracy was caught between the Kremlin and the Yugoslav masses. The native bourgeoisie had been So thoroughly destroyed that the CPY had no buffer between it and the masses. It therefore faced this situ ation. Either to try to impose the Kremlin's demands upon the Yugoslav masses, which meant inevitably whether the demands were carried out or not, the sacrificing of substan tial elements in the bureaucracy. (The more it imposed these demands on the Yugoslav masses, the less would it be able to use its mass base to defend itself against the inevitable purge.) Or to attempt to defy the Kremlin and lean for support on the masses in Yugoslavia and the rival imperialism, taking advantage of shifts in the world situation. Tito was able to break with the Kremlin because he had a mass base. But precisely this situation poses the revolution ary and counter-revolutionary alternatives with extreme sharpness. 

It is one thing to say that "Stalin's most pliant and devoted agents" were "forced into a struggle with the Krem lin in order to preserve their influence and leadership over the masses . " (Fourth International, October, 1 949, emphasis added.) This leaves the door open to revolutionary struggle 

against the Titoist bureaucracy. It is quite another to identify the revolutionary struggles of the Yugoslav masses with Tito's attacks against the Krem lin and his break with Stalin. This opens the door to ever more uncritical support of Tito. It drives the Yugoslav masses into national unity with the CPY bureaucracy in state power, encourages illusions regarding the mythical national inde pendence of Yugoslavia, and bars the way to the only escape from Stalinist domination, the joint revolutionary struggles of the masses in Eastern Europe and Russia, against the 

96 

Stalinist bureaucracy in all its forms and for the Socialist United States of Europe. The importance of this is not only in relation to Yugo slavia. The contradictions of Stalinism are immense, and as the world crisis develops, will appear in a multitude of forms. Titoism is only one. It is the substitution of national unity 

against foreign domination with the bureaucracy in state power, for class struggle against that bureaucracy . The danger of support to Titoism is that it presupposes and fortifies the conception that the breakup of Stalinism will come from competing elements in the bureaucracy, and particularly from the national bureaucracies in state power, rather than from the mass revolutionary struggle against the bureaucracy as such. The proletarian revolution against Stalinism will be of necessity from its very beginnings concretely international. The concretely nationalist and abstractly internationalist orientation of Titoism, on the other hand, is not at all acci dental and has its own logic. The CPY's efforts to maintain a mythical independence will land it either in the camp of Western imperialism or back in the Kremlin camp, even if to achieve this latter alternative, the bureaucratic cadre must rid itself of Tito, Kardelj, etc. This is not abstract theory, speculation, or psycho analysis of the CPY. In their own documents, published for all the world to see, since the split with Stalin, the Titoists themselves have proclaimed their aims, methods, and funda mental economic theories. They are Stalinist to the core : the one-party state, the bureaucratically administered plan, the export of petty-bourgeois liberalism for international consumption. Every step that they ask the world proletariat to take in their defense is for one purpose and one purpose only to strengthen the position of the Yugoslav national capital on the world-market and the Yugoslav unified state authority over and against the Yugoslav masses. At the same tim e , every defense of its national capital, in the present 

97 struggle for world mastery between the two great masses of capital, only centralizes it further for attraction into one orbit when it is repelled from the other. Such is the "Johnson-Forest" analysis of Yugoslavia. On reading The Invading Socialist Society some critics shrugged their shoulders and said that it had little connection with practical politics. We point out to them without malice that it is precisely from this analysis that we are able to give a strictly materialistic account o f the economic, social and political development of Yugoslavia. On the other hand, the presumed practical politics of orthodox Trotskyism has re sulted in this : that its whole analysis can be summed up in the question whether the leaders of the CPY are sincere or insincere in their protestations about democracy. The Counter-Revolution in Yugoslavia The debate now going on in the Fourth International as to when the revolution took place in Yugoslavia obviously does not involve us directly, since we do not believe that any revolution took place in Yugoslavia at all. However, to assist the debate, we would remind the comrades of the following accounts of the events in Yugoslavia. At the time these ac counts were written, we accepted them, and contrary to the other tendencies in the Fourth International, still accept them. How was the revolution in Yugoslavia crushed? At the time that the Titoist bureaucracy strangled the mass move ment in Yugoslavia, everybody knew it. It was described in the Fourth International in careful detail. The Titoist bu reaucracy was singled out as an example of a police dictator ship on the Stalinist model : "During the War, Stalinist bureaucratization and sup pression must have proceeded apace along with the growth of the popular movement and the promulgation of the social 98 revolutionary measures. For no sooner was the present government installed than it began to emulate all the other East European police regimes in its savagery and terror. The correspondents reported that an atmosphere of fear pervaded the Capital and that the dreaded secret police, the OZNA, were operating everywhere. Tito is imitating Stalinist Russia even to copying the elegantly cut uniforms of the Kremlin bureaucrats and weighting down his military tunic with countless shining medals. The black reactionary character of Stalinism is exposed by its need of a police dictatorship in Yugoslavia - a country where it enjoyed tremendous popu larity and support. This development cannot be explained solely on the grounds of the horrible economic dislocations. It was unquestionably bred by Tito's twin needs of not only suppressing the old counter-revolutionary classes but at the same time keeping an iron hand on the working class and preventing their emergence as an independent - non bureaucratized and therefore anti-Stalinist force." (Fourth International, November, 1 946 .) It would be hard to duplicate this account for accuracy. This was in 1 946 when orthodox Trotskyism considered Yugoslavia a capitalist state. Since the break with the Kremlin, the writer has evolved the position that Yugoslavia is a workers' state, but he has not lost his eye for accurate detail. We read in the Discussion Bulletin of April, 1 950, this account of Yugoslavian events : "Attempting to fight their way out of their economic cul-de-sac by 'building socialism in one country,' they em barked on vastly ambitious plans of industrialization. Since they lacked the machinery, resources, productive capacities or trained personnel, they began taking it out of the hides of the workers. Piecework and speed up were introduced in the plants, hours of work lengthened, the authority of manage ment made absolute. The desperate nature of the difficulties was highlighted recently when in Yugoslavia, where there exists, in contradistinction to the satellite states, some 99 enthusiasm for the plan, the regime was forced to give up the 'voluntary labor brigade' system and institute a new system of contract labor which freezes the worker to his job ." There is no room for disagreement. And here we ask our trade union comrades particularly to define the system so well described by the Yugoslavs themselves and by Comrade 

E. R. Frank. Do they think that this is a workers' state? Do they think that this is a transitional economy? How is it distinguished from the conditions of labor in the factories of the rest of the capitalist world? Recognition that the Tito regime had suppressed the mass movement was not confined to individual writers. An 

official statement, appearing in the Fourth International as late as October, 1 949, was brutal in its accuracy. "The revolutionary origins of the present regime in Yugoslavia offer a strange contrast to its bureaucratic and monolithic form of rule . What is the reason for this contra dictory development? At first glance it would appear that the vast movement of the masses set in motion during the war should have produced a flowering of workers ' democ racy. But j ust the contrary occurred . The regime is dominat ed by a monolithic Stalinist party which imitates the Russian leader cult, boasts of its ruthless suppression of factions and prohibits all vital criticism and opposition to its basic policies." The statement was equally remorseless in tracing the Stalinist roots of the CPY leadership : "This development has its roots in the history of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. Beginning as a mass party after the October Revolution, it was stultified by the impo sition of false policies and bureaucratic methods from the Stalinized Comintern. In 1 937, on orders from the Kremlin, the entire central committee of the party with the exception of Tito was purged . The new leadership was trained in Mos cow or in the GPU school in Spain. Taking advantage of the conditions of illegality and official repression, it consolidated 

1 00 

its bureaucratic grip on the organization by the suppression of all other tendencies and by framing up and expelling its opponents and critics ." The Titoists, the statement continues, were ruthlessly bureaucratic, particularly against independent revolutionary expressions from the left : "It was this Stalinized party which succeeded in gaining the leadership of the partisan insurrection . Despite the participation of masses of workers in revolutionary action , bureaucratic methods were favored by the conditions o f foreign occupation and civil war which prevailed in the country . Military discipline and rule-by-command became the accepted mode of procedure and were utilized by the Stalinist leadership to stifle any tendency for greater democ racy in the ranks of the party and the mass movement. It appears from a study of the events that while a certain lati tude was granted to b ourgeois groups and p arties , ind epend ent revolutionary expressions from the left were mercilessly crushed." Is this the way that Marxism treats what for it is the greatest event in history, the successful proletarian revolu tion? Surely "Johnson-Forest" are justified in asking for the re-examination of a theory which imposes such humiliating self-stultification upon those who follow it. 

Our Political Views on Yugosl avia Orthodox Trotskyism in all its tendencies is opposed to our analysis. Its own theory has led it to its present atti tude toward the closest association possible to the CPY. This is an action, the majority against us is overwhelming, and Bolshevism demands unity in action. The Fourth Internation al will have to make its experiences. We do not therefore propose to carry on any active discussion on the question, but it is of sufficient importance that all should know exactly 

1 0 1 what are our political views. (a) The rulers of Yugoslavia may make gestures, over tures, and even sympathetically consider Trotskyism. It is possible that they may even go to the lengths of organizing around them a Fourth International and acting as its center in the same way as Stalinist Russia has for years acted as the organizing center of the Third InternationaL Every success gained along these lines by orthodox Trotskyism makes only more certain the ultimate price that will be paid. The CPY seeks not the world revolution but the defense of "Commu nism in a single country, Yugoslavia. " At the moment when Yugoslavia's mythical independence will be seen as the hollow fiction that it is, Le., at the moment of the outbreak of war, the CPY will declare policy in terms of the interests of the particular mass of capital to which it is attached. If it should be on the side of Stalinist Russia, it will call upon the workers inside Russia and all over the world to support the Stalinist regime for the purpose of winning victory. If it is on the side of American imperialism, it will summon the prole tariat of the United States to work and fight with all its soul for American democracy. At that time it will be able to hit the Fourth International a mighty blow. The Fourth Inter national in return will be able to call the CPY traitors. To have to do that will harm the Fourth International, especially 

if the present course is continued. It will not harm Titoism in any way. (b) The past record of the CPY is a record of unwaver ing support of Stalinist Russia and the Communist Interna tional. It has supported Stalinism in its persecution of the Russian workers, its slave labor camps, its Moscow Trials, its monumental lies, its betrayal of proletarian revolution, its sacrificing of the proletariat of whole nations, its assassina tions, its incalculable contributions to the barbarism which is now eating away at human society. The conception that "Johnson-Forest" have of the Fourth International does not include collaboration with 

1 02 

these elements but has always seen them as the worst enemies of the proletariat and the organic foes of everything for which the Fourth International must stand . We do not say that all who have supported Stalinism in the past are unfit for membership in our organization. Mem bers of the GPU have in the past broken with Stalinism and joined the Fourth International. However, as we wrote in 

1 949 : 

"As with self-determination, the evaluation of Tito's defiance of Stalinism is rooted in the sociological conditions . Mobilization of a mass Communist Party even by Togliatti or Thorez in defiance of the Cominform or the . Russian regime would be an event of world-wide significance for the revolu tionary movement, however empirical, limited or halting might be the ideological basis on which such a defiance might begin. "The defiance by the Yugoslav Communist Party is o f a fundamentally different character. I t i s and cannot b e seen otherwise than as a defense of the p ossession of the state property, control of the surplus-labor and other bureaucratic privileges, on the one hand, and on the other, fear of being submitted to the ruthless purges of the GPU." The Titoists are a privileged section of society, exploit ing millions of workers and peasants, masters of a state. Their Leninism is neither more nor less than the "Leninism" of Stalinism. Our hostility to them is more implacable than to those Stalinist leaders who are at the head of the proletariat in a country where the proletariat is free to act . *' 

(c) It is our opinion that the whole past of our move ment and our whole experience with our opposition to             

> *Here, regretfully, for it is painful to have to repeat elementary principles of revo lutionary practice, we have to recall another aspect of Leninism for those sowers of confusion regarding "Johnson-Forest" critical support to workers' parties which are "agents of a capitalist-Fascist power." We remind these comrades that Lenin's analysis of the Social-Democracy as capitalist parties based on monopoly capitalism, agents of the capitalist national state, did not prevent him from critical support to these parties under certain concrete circumstances where the prole tariat was free to act.

1 03 Stalinism should teach us to train our membership and those who listen to us in a spirit of critical hostility, reserve, dis trust of all such elements. If their orientation is toward breaking with Stalinist theory and Stalinist practice in deeds and not only in words, that will not be diverted by the harsh est criticism from the Trotskyist movement. Undoubtedly Tito 's break with Stalin has deeply affected many rank and file elements in the Stalinist parties all over the world. Our intervention should have been our principles, our ideas, in irreconcilable opposition to Titoism. This would have given revolutionary clarification to the dissidents. We are opposed to the defense of Yugoslavia against Stalinist Russia for rea sons which we shall explain in the next section. But it was quite possible to combine the defense of the national inde pendence of Yugoslavia against Stalinist Russia with the most critical attitude to the faisity and hypocrisy of Titoist theory and practice. The idea that Tito's declaration in favor of Leninism - and these are nothing to the declarations of Stalin in favor of Leninism to declare that this is the great est event in the history of Trotskyism so far, and the hope of our movement for the future , is to strike a terrible blow at all that we have stood for in the past. The future of the Fourth International rests, as it has always rested, upon the progress we have made with the revolutionary proletariat in irreconcilable struggle with bureaucracies of all and every kind. (d) The reports of capable people who have gone to Yugoslavia and returned say that there is "democracy." We can fill notebooks with the views of those who went to Rus sia and saw the same when the Left Opposition was being hooted down in party meetings. It is possible that everyone discusses Trotskyism freely when the leaders are discussing Trotskyism freely. But Tito has himself given his definition of democratic centralism in his report to the party in 1 948. 

It is that ". . . almost every factionalist is not far from being a provocateur or similar enemy of the working class." 

1 04 

"Johnson-Forest" know that this "democratic centralism" can serve only to protect the interests of rulers. If that is 

wrong, then everything we have been taught and learned 

is wrong, and we have to begin all over again, However great our differences with Trotsky, we see nothing in his writings to make us believe that he would not have known the difference between an orientation to the bureaucracy of Yugoslavia and an orientation toward the proletarian masses and poor peasants of that country.

SOME POLITICAL CONCLUSIONS 

# QTATE-CAPITALISM, I.E., THE RESULT of the world 

# "tendency to centralization , so p owerful in Europe, has brought with it not only a labor bureaucracy determined to destroy the national state . A glance at Europe today will show how altered are the conditions from those which exist ed as late as 1 940. In 1 947 in The Invading Socialist Society , 

we wrote as the second of the two points which summed up our ideas : "II. THE STRATEGIC ORIENTATION IS THE UNI FICATION OF PROLETARIAN STRUGGLE ON AN INTERNATIONAL SCALE AS EXEMPLIFIED IN THE STRUGGLE FOR THE SOCIALIST UNITED STATE S OF EUROPE." At the World Congress in 1 948, our European co thinkers presented no separate resolution on Russia. For them, as for us, that is over . They presented one resolution for the whole international situation and on the Russian discussion presented for voting merely extracts from the international resolution. The p oint of view may be gathered from this brief extract from the resolution : "Today the movement toward the centralization o f European capital, which ensured the victory of statified property against the kulak, has solidified the power of the bureaucracy at home and projected its state and its army into the heart of Europe, in the interlude of peace as well as in war. Once more, in World War II, the great masses of the Russian peasantry, organized in the army, were injected into 

1 06 

the political , struggles of Europe, this time as far as Berlin. Despite withdrawals, substantial elements have been left there and tomorrow will be reinforced by even greater num bers. Great numbers of the European proletariat are under essentially Russian domination. Great numbers of the ad vanced proletariat of Germany and the rest of Europe have been conversely incorporated into all levels of the proletariat in the gangrenous society of Russia. Only a perspective o f the complete defeat of the proletariat and the reversal of bourgeois society to outmoded forms (the theory of retro gression) can therefore see as the axis of policy the danger of the restoration of private property in this struggle of the Russian proletariat against the Russian bureaucracy, in peace or in war." The resolution analyzed the European socialist character of the coming Russian Revolution ; "The Russian struggle is in reality the struggle between the Russian proletariat and the Russian bureaucracy for the control of the Russian statified economy and for the eman cipation or enslavement of the labor movement of Europe and Eastern Asia. In 1 9 29 the pressure of world capital com pelled the bureaucracy to side with the proletariat against the kulak. Today the centralization of European capital and the penetration of the Red Army into the heart of Europe has thrown into insignificance the danger of the kulak resto ration. The Russian proletariat and the masses of peasants organized in the Red Army have become an integral part o f the concrete struggle o n a European scale for the revolution ary seizure of power and its uninterrupted transformation into socialist revolution. The task today and tomorrow is the integration of the European proletarian revolutionary forces, particularly in Eastern and Central Europe , with the Russian proletariat. Inside Russia and outside, the great oppressed masses of Europe, burning with indignation at the totalitarian apparatus, will seek to split the great masses of the Russian peasants and workers from the MVD, the 

1 07 Kremlin bureaucracy, the officer caste and their bureaucratic colonial satellites . . . . "

Never was the perspective of world revolution so concrete : "If World War III is not prevented by proletarian revo lution and takes its projected course, the vast millions of the basic revolutionary forces in Europe will more or less rapidly be transformed into an international army of resistance movements. The revolutionary vanguard, steeled by the con viction that humanity moves inexorably and concretely to the proletarian power on a world sc ale, or universal ruin, sinks itself deeper and deeper into the mass movement, pre paring the proletariat for the vast revolutionary upheavals on a continental scale which it knows must come, in peace or in war. In the present conditions of Europe, any policy which impedes, confuses or deflects the proletariat from this course in peace or in war can have ruinous consequences for that party which is responsible for them." It is from our economic analysis also that we judge the present tendencies in world politics: the politics of the atomic and hydrogen bombs and the Berlin air-lift; the domi nation of Eastern Europe by Russia; the Marshall Plan, the division and occupation of Germany, the Truman Doctrine, Truman's program for sending capital to underdeveloped countries, the end of isolationism in the US, the international activities of the CIO and the AFL, the Assembly for a United Europe, to which must be added the hopeless economic situation of China and other colonial areas without aid, economic, social and political, from the proletariat of the advanced countries. That is why in the resolution previously referred to there appeared the following: "As far back as 1 932, Trotsky in the face of the German counter-revolution, urged upon the Left Opposition the pub lication and popularization of a plan for the joint proletarian development of German and Russian economy. In a world situation in which even the bourgeoisie must envisage and as 

1 08 

far as possible plan the reorganization of economy on acontinental and world scale, the Fourth International has remained helpless and impotent before this responsibility which it and it alone can carry out. "Since 1 943 the Fourth International has been cease lessly warned of the necessity for giving as concrete an expression as possible to the slogan of the Socialist United States of Europe. Precisely because of its complete failure to do this, it has suffered and continues to suffer a series of terrible blows. "(a) It has allowed the bourgeoisie and the Stalinist bureaucracy to take the initiative by a spurious, counter revolutionary but at any rate concrete 'internationalism.' "(b) It leaves the European proletariat p olitically dis armed before the vigorous theoretical and practical interven tion of the American bourgeoisie and the Kremlin into every aspect of European economy and politics. "(c) Lacking a concrete plan of its own in opposition to the Marshall Plan, it not only allows the labor administrators of American capital to pose as the apostles of international ism and proletarian aid. By the abstractness of its posing of the strategy of the Socialist United States of Europe, it is reduced to a shameful tail-ending of the powerful Stalinist opposition and still further encourages pro-Stalinist tend encies. "(d) The absence of a plan which includes the Russian economy under the control of the Russian proletariat leaves the Russian proletariat, the proletariat of Eastern Europe and the Russian occupation troops without a glimpse of a perspective opposed to the two imperialisms and still further facilitates the penetration into the movement of the unpara} lelled lies and falsifications of Stalinist propaganda." The resolution stressed the interpenetration of imperial ist and civil wars in our epoch, in Europe, Asia and Africa, and warned that only the concrete strategy of coordinating the revolutionary actions of the oppressed masses across 

1 09 national lines would advance the proletarian revolution : "It is the task o f the Fourth International carefully to watch each concrete situation and to safeguard the prole tarian vanguard from committing itself to support of the Russian regime or to opposition movements, disguised as national movements which are in reality agents of American imperialism. Without missing one opportunity of tactical support of any section o f the oppressed masses in its concrete struggle against oppression, the Fourth International bases its policy on the concrete stage of development and strives in peace as well as in war to unite the revolutionary elements in both camps. In areas like Eastern Europe, the objective situation demands that the workers base their revolutionary policy on the unification of the oppressed masses in both the oppressing and the oppressed countries against the oppressing p owers. The same basic strategy must guide the Fourth Inter national in Korea and Manchuria." The resolution included a special warning on colonial revolutions in our epoch : "The experience of China indicates the economic perils of colonial revolution in the age when the export of surplus capital has practically come to an end. After nearly forty years of unceasing civil war, the economy of the country is falling to pieces. The socialist economic reconstruction of China, integrated with the industrial potential of Japan and Manchuria, must form the fundamental theoretical basis of the struggle against the native bourgeoisie and the imperial ism of the US and Russia. Vast revolutionary movements in Africa and historical and geographical conditions similarly link the struggle for the Socialist United States of Africa to the European and world economy." The same tendency to centralization e xplains our opposition to the support of the struggle for the national independence of Yugoslavia. We did not arrive at this when Tito broke with Stalin. In 1 947, in The Invading Socialist So 

ciety (p. 3 1 ), we explained with great care why for Poland, 

1 1 0 

Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Rumania and Hungary, the struggle for national independence since World War II is an illusion and cannot fail to have reactionary consequences. The same centralization , state-capitalism and the capital ist bureaucracy it brings, also determines what was expressed as follows: "In France and Italy any movement of the masses brings them immediately into direct conflict with their own leaders as rulers or direct representatives of the government. The simplest of the immediate demands concerning the high cost of living or the right to strike become questions of state pol icy and continually pose before the workers the fun damental question of state power. Thus the social structure of state p ower in statified production places the workers in a situa tion where any determined struggle compels them to face the problem of creating their own organization in order to bring pressure upon, and i f necessary, to break the power of the labor leadership as virtual functionaries o f the existing government . . . . "Every crisis of production, whether resulting in in crease or decrease of wages, becomes merely an opportunity of the bourgeois state, behind constitutional forms, to limit and circumscribe the most elementary rights, right to strike , etc., of the masses . Thus, the struggle for democracy , particu larly in advanced countries, is no longer the struggle for the extension of popular rights. Liberalism is now the advocate , instead o f the enemy o f states (Wallace) . . . . Thus, in the statified production, the constant struggle for democratic rights becomes the struggle for militant independent mass organizations by which the workers can mobilize themselves to bring pressure upon, control, renew and ultimately over throw the trade union bureaucracy and the labor leadership on the road to the proletarian revolution. This is the strategic basis for the tactical orientation toward the struggle for democratic demands in this period." 

All these are strategic orientations for an international 

1 1 1 movement. Practical politics consists of the art of applying them in infinitely varied circumstances, but the variety is in the circumstances, not in what is to be applied. It is our opinion that to point, on the one hand, to the contem porary barbarism, the imminent destruction of civilization and not to put the boldest program concretely before the masses is equivalent to saying that they do not yet un derstand the nature of the modern crisis. We believe that they understand it better than any other section of the population, taught by the very structure and insoluble contradictions of state-capitalism. 1 1 2

PHILOSOPHY AND STATE CAPITALISM 

# d)lV HEN WE REACH STATE-CAPITALISM, one-party 

# IJIn state, cold war, hydrogen bomb, it is obvious that we have reached ultimates. We are now at the stage where all universal questions are matters of concrete specific urgency for society in general as well as for every individual. As we wrote in The Invading Socialist Society : 

"It is precisely the character of our age and the maturity of humanity that obliterates the opposition between theory and practice, between the intellectual occupations of the 'educated' and the masses." (p. 1 4.) All previous distinctions, politics and economics, war and peace, agitation and propaganda, party and mass, the individual and society, national, civil and imperialist war, single country and one world, immediate needs and ultimate solutions - all these it is impossible to keep separate any longer. Total planning is inseparable from permanent crisis, the world struggle for the minds of men from the world tendency to the complete mechanization of men. State-capitalism is in itself the total contradiction, absolute antagonism . In it are concentrated all the contra dictions of revolution and counter-revolution. The proletar iat, never so revolutionary as it is today, is over half the world in the stranglehold of Stalinism , the form of the counter-revolution in our day, the absolute opposite of the proletarian revolution. It is the totality of these contradictions that today com pels philosophy, a total conception. Hence the propaganda 1 1 3 ministry of Hitler, the omnipresent orthodoxy of Stalinism, the Voice of America. The war over productivity is fought in terms of philosophy, a way of life. When men question not the fruits of toil but the toil itself, then philosophy in Marx's sense of human activity has become actual. World War I plunged the world into complete chaos. Lenin between 1 9 1 4 and 1 9 1 7 established in theory : (a) the economic basis of the counter-revolutionary Social Democ racy (The economic basis of imperialist war had been estab lished before him . ) ; (b) the Soviet democracy in contradis tinction to bourgeois democracy. But before he did this, he had to break with the philosophical method of the Second International. He worked at this privately in a profound study of the Hegelian dialectic applied to Marx's Capital, the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat. Thirty years have now passed. Lenin's method of eco nomic analysis is ours to use, not to repeat his findings. His 

political conception of complete abolition of bureaucracy and all ordering from above is today to be driven to its ulti mate as the revolutionary weapon against the one-party state. But today the problems of production which Lenin had to tackle in Russia in 1 920 are universal. No longer to be ignored is the philosophical method he used in holding fast to the creation of a new and higher social organization of labor as "the essence" of the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is not the Marxists who have compelled society to face this issue. Today in every layer of society, the great philosophical battles that matter are precisely those over production, the role of the proletariat, the one-party state, and many of the combatants are professed dialecticians. The crisis of production today is the crisis of the antag onism between manual and intellectual labor. The problem of modern philosophy from Descartes in the sixteenth cen tury to Stalinism in 1 9 50 is the problem of the division of labor between the intellectuals and the workers . 

1 1 4 

Rationalism : the Philosophy of the Bourgeoisie The revolutionary bourgeoisie which established its power against feudalism could only develop a philosophy of history and of society in which, on the one hand, it spoke for the progress of all society, and on the other, for itself as the leaders of society . This philosophy can be summed up in one word : rationalism . Rationalism is the philosophy of bourgeois political economy. It is materialist and not idealist in so far as it com bats superstition, seeks to expand the productive forces and increase the sum total of goods. But there is no such thing as a classless materialism. Rationalism conceives this expan sion as a division of labor between the passive masses and the active elite . Thereby it reinstates idealism. Because it does not and cannot doubt that harmonious progress is inevitable by this path , the essence of rationalism is uncritical or vulgar materialism, and uncritical or vulgar idealism . In the springtime of capitalism this rationalistic division of labor was the basis of a common attempt of individual men associated in a natural environment to achieve control over nature . Today this division of labor is the control in social production of the administrative elite over the masses. 

Rationalism has reached its end in the complete divorce and absolute disharmony between manual and intellectual labor, between the socialized proletariat and the monster of central ized capital. The specific p olitical ideology developed by rationalism was democracy - equality of opportunity for all men to rise to the top, and hence equality in all spheres outside of pro duction, before the law, at the polls and in the market. Today, from end to end of the world, men know that democracy is bankrupt. What is to take its place they do not know. The alternative seems to be planned economy and one-party state. This is the philosophical question. But the philosophy of planned economy and one-party 

1 1 5 state is distinguishable from that of the bourgeoisie only by its more complete rationalism. The labor bureaucracy in power or out of it sees the solution to the crisis of produc tion in scientific progress, greater output. It consciously seeks to plan and organize the division of labor as the means to further accumulation of capital. In ideology it is ready to expropriate those representatives of private property who stand in the way of this complete rationalization. But didn't this bureaucracy develop out of the working class? It did and it could only have developed out of the working class. It is a product of the modern mass movement, created by the centralization of capital, and holds its position only because of this movement. At the same time it cannot conceive the necessity for abolishing the division of labor in production, the only solution to the crisis in production. By a remorseless logic, therefore, representation of the prole tariat turns into its opposite, administration over the prole tariat . The end of bourgeois rationalism is this crisis of the revolution and counter-revolution in production. The Hegelian Critique of Rationalism There are various critiques of rationalism. All base themselves on Hegel. All are primarily concerned with the proletariat . Until the epoch of the French Revolution, the philoso phy of uncritical materialism and uncritical idealism was not seriously challenged. It was the emergence of the active masses in the French Revolution, on the one hand, and on the other, the counter-revolution carried to its completion by Napoleon, which created a crisis in this ideology. As early as 1 7 8 1 , a challenge to rationalism had already come from backward Germany. For the French and English petty-bourgeoisie, rationalism had a material base, the ad vances of modern industry. The powerless German petty-1 1 6 bourgeoisie, however, could criticize rationalism because for them it was only theory. Kant's Critique of Pure Reason 

posed the contradiction between advancing science and human freedom. It was the first introduction into the mod ern world o f dialectic which begins with the recognition of contradiction. But Kant wrote before the French Revolution and Napoleon. He could therefore believe in the solution o f the contradiction b y a moral elite, all men who obeyed the moral law of acting in accordance with the general interest. The uncritical or vulgar idealism of rationalism was replaced by critical or moral idealism. Hegel, on the other hand, having seen the revolution and counter-revolution, could entertain no such reliance on men of goodwill. He began by placing contradiction squarely in the center of reality. Thereby he rejected rationalism , either in its traditional bourgeois form or its petty-bourgeois Kantian variation. Hegel refused even to argue with anybody who doubted that contradictions are real. In brief, Hegel's critique of rationalism assert s : (a) Contradiction, not harmonious increase and de crease, is the creative and moving principle of history. Soci ety cannot develop unless it has to overcome contradiction. (b) All development takes place as a result of sel f-move-ment, not organization or direction by external forces. (c) Self-movement springs from and is the overcoming of antagonisms within an organism, not the struggle against external foes. (d) It is not the world of nature that confronts man as an alien power to be overcome . It is the alien power that he has himself created . (e) The end toward which mankind is inexorably devel oping by the constant overcoming of internal antagonisms is 

not the enjoyment, ownership or use of goods, but self realization, creativity based upon the incorporation into the individual personality of the whole previous development of humanity. Freedom is creative universality, not utility. 1 1 7 Between 1 9 1 4 and 1 9 1 7 Lenin, for the fIrst time, mastered this. These dialectical principles which were the heart of Hegel's system are absolutely revolutionary. After the French Revolution, no further progress in thought could be made without holding fast to the principle of creativity and the contradictory process by which this creativity develops. The next step forward in human thought had to be the appropri ation of these principles by the revolutionary masses, dia lectical materialism. Any other path meant barbarism and intellectual disintegration. The Paris Commune and Marx's 

Capital, these are the heights reached by society in the nineteenth century. On the other side, what? Cavaignac, Napoleon III, Bismarck ; Baudelaire , Dostoevsky, Rimbaud, the counter-revolutionary regime of state-capital and the desperate soul-searching intellectuals. It is fashionable to use Marx's statement that he stood Hegel on his head to transform Marx into a vulgar materialist preoccupied with technological progress and the stomachs of the masses, expanded production and increased consump tion. It is today the most dangerous perversion of all Marx stood for. Marx himself in his fight against vulgar materialism reaffirmed that "the Hegelian contradiction (is) the source of all dialectic." Without the dialectic of Hegel, the idealism of Hegel could not be destroyed. But the dialectic of Hegel could be retained and expanded only by the concept of the creative activity of the masses. On this basis the dialectic became in Marx's hands a revolutionary theoretical weapon against bureaucracy in all its forms, but primarily and partic ularly in the process of production. As we wrote in World Revolutionary Perspectives : 

"Hegel saw objective history as the successive manifes tation of a world-spirit. Marx placed the objective movement in the process of production. Hegel had been driven to see the perpetual quest for universality as necessarily confined to the process of knowledge. Marx reversed this and rooted 

1 1 8 

the quest for universality in the need for the free and full development of all the inherent and acquired characteristics in productive and intellectual labor. Hegel had made the motive force of history the work of a few gifted individuals in whom was concentrated the social movement . Marx pro pounded the view that it was only when ideas seized hold of the masses that the process of history moved. Hegel dreaded the revolt of the modern mass. Marx made the modern proletarian revolution the motive force of modern history. Hegel placed the guardianship of society in the hands of the bureaucracy. Marx saw'future society as headed for ruin except under the rulership of the proletariat and the vanishing distinction between intellectual and manual labor." (p. xx.) Hegel could not carry the dialectical logic to its con clusions in the socialist revolution because he did not and could not base himself on the advanced industrial proletariat . He saw and described with horror the fragmentation and loss of individuality by the worker under the capitalist divi sion of labor. But the workers whom he knew were not the organized, disciplined and united proletariat which had by Marx's time begun to announce itself as the new organizer of society and which we know so well today. Hegel could not know these and therefore he could not envisage universal freedom for the masses of men. The result was that in politics, economics and philosophy, he was com pelled to reinstate the old rationalistic division of labor between the intellectual elite and the masses. Hegel did not only imply this. He stated it. The universal bureaucratic class, the intellectual class, must rule society. Again, as we wrote in World Revolutionary Perspectives : 

"Concrete universality for the mass of men was impos sible . It was a mighty decision to take. But Hegel did not flinch. Only the state, said Hegel, could embody universality for the community. But in particular the state was a defense against the revolutionary masses. Hegel had seen them and 

1 1 9 their activities in European history and now the French Revolution had shown that nothing could ever come of it. So it had been and it would ever be. At each stage, therefore, a few chosen individuals represented the abstract spirit of mankind. Universality liad to be restricted to these. This was the basis of Hegel's idealism. But with the clear insight of a great scholar of both past and contemporary history, and b y his mastery of his method, he analyzed a n d drew his analysis to its conclusions. The state would have to organize produc tion . The chaos of capitalist production would have to be disciplined by organizing the separate industries into corpora tions. The state would be the state of the corporations . Uni versality being impossible to all men, the state bureaucracy would embody universality and represent the community. " (p. xix.) So that in the end, the greatest of all the bourgeois philosophers, the most encyclopedic mind that Europe had produced, the founder of the dialectic, in Engels' words, the maker of an epoch, could not transcend his historic barrier and was recaptured in the rationalist trap from which he had sought s o profoundly to extricate European thought . Hegel destroyed all dogmatisms but one - the dogmatism of the backwardness of the masses. Once the revolutionary solution of the contradiction escaped him, he clung to the bureauc racy. The intellectual elite would rescue society and disci pline the revolting masses. Reinstated were uncritical materi alism, a purely material existence for the masses, and uncriti cal idealism, the solution of social crisis by the intellectual bureaucracy. We today who have seen Stalinism and the labor bu reaucracy the world over can fIrst fully comprehend this, Marx's esse �tial critique of Hegel. * Only the revolutionary

proletariat, said Marx, can appropriate the dialectical logic of Hegel. Hegel himself, because he held fast to the intellec tual elite, ended up, despite his thoroughgoing analysis of contradiction and negativity, in the crass materialism and crass idealism of the state bureaucracy. Today Hegel's idealism or Marx's dialectical materialism are no l onger theory. The elite, the organizers, the adminis trators, the leaders, confront the self-mobilized proletariat . Counter-revolution and revolution oppose one another with out intermediaries. Modern society offers no third camp between complete totalitarianism and complete democracy. 

Rationalism : the Philosophy of Stalinism The philosophy of Stalinism is the philosophy of the elite, the bureaucracy, the organizers, the leaders, clothed in Marxist terminology. It is the extreme, the historical limit of the rationalism of the bourgeoisie, carefully organized to look like a new revolutionary doctrine . Stalinism, the ideology o f state-capitalism, is the rein statement of uncritical materialism and uncritical idealism . The materialism is in the accumulation theory : the kernel o f all Stalinist-Titoist philosophy i s that the worker must work harder than he ever did before. The idealism is in the theory of the party : the leaders , the elite, must lead as they never did before. No one is more conscious of this than the Stalinist bureaucracy itself. At the center of all ideological campaigns in Stalinist Russia is the attitude of the workers toward their work : "People . . . consider labor as something alien to them . . . regard their work joylessly or indifferently . . . contrive to give society less output and worse quality and to take from the government and from society as much as they can." The Stalinists call these workers : 

1 2 1 ". . . our loafers, our triflers, our grabbers, flouting labor discipline, looking sullenly askance at their work which leads to flaws in output, to damaged equipment and tools, to breakdown in production schedules, and to other negative 

manifestations which retard the increase of production ."* For the Stalinist bureaucracy, state-property converts labor "from the drab burden it was under capitalism into a matter of honor and glory, a matter of prowess and heroism." The intelligentsia tells the workers : You work. The workers, on the other hand, continue to resist speed up and the disci pline of accumulated capital, statified or otherwise. This is called by the Stalinists "the old outlook on labor," a "capi talist survival in the popular consciousness." This is no longer a question of Soviet youth and textbooks in political econ omy. It is now the workers counterposing to the bureaucracy another "ideology" which the Stalinists admit "may spread to �larming dimensions. " ) The Stalinists recognize the urgent necessity o f mobil izing "all the vehicles of ideological work" to combat this "outlook and conduct" and to "educate the workers in the spirit of self-sacrificing work for the national weal." To the outlook and conduct of the workers, the bureaucracy must counterpose its own outlook and conduct. The conduct is the unbridled savagery of the police-state ; the outlook is undisguised rationalism, "a materialistic outlook upon life . . . an exclusively scientific concept of the universe." In June, 1 947 , the Central Committee of the CPSU withdrew from circulation a textbook on the History of West ern Philosophy by Georgi Alexandrov, which in 1 946 had won a Stalin prize. Zhdanov, who spoke for the Central Com mittee at a national conference of "philosophical workers," made it clear that philosophy was no longer an "academic"          

> *"Communist Education of the Worker and the Elimination of capitalist Sur vivals from the Popular Consciousness" by S. Kovalyov, published a s Ideological Conflicts in Soviet Russia by Public Affalrs Press, Washington, D.C., 1948 (em phasis added).

1 22 question but of "enormous scientific and political signifi cance."* The "gravest dangers" ("much graver than you imagine") threatened unless the philosophical front was reorganized along two main lines : (a) the rewriting of the history of philosophy as the history of science ; and (b) the divorce of Marx from Hegel and the purging of Hegel from philosophic discussion. Six months later there appeared an outline of how "A Soviet History of Philosophy" ought to be written. * * The main enemy of social progress from the days of the ancient Orient and Greece to the present was discovered to be the idealism of superstition. Revolutionary ideology was equated with the materialism of scientific progress. Quoting Stalin, Marxism was described as retaining only "the rational kernel" of Hegel's dialectic logic, "so as to give it a contem porary scientific appearance." On the surface it appeared that the Stalinist interven tion was to defend the materialism of Marx against the ideal ism of Hegel. In reality the theoretical threat came from the revolutionary dialectical logic. In political economy the Stalinists seek to defend the classless nature of state-property and planning. The theoretical enemy is the theory of state capitalism. In philosophy they seek to propagate the fiction of the classless nature of rationalism and materialism . The enemy is the proletariat resisting labor discipline by the bureaucracy . Again and again Zhdanov attacked Alexandrov for "objectivism." The Stalinists are terrified by the obviously growing conviction that there is in Stalinist Russia an "ob jective" basis for the "struggle of opposites, the struggle between the old and the new, between the dying and the rising, between the decaying and the developing." Such an objective basis could only be the class struggle. Hence they must purge Marxism of the Hegelian concept of the     

> ""On the History of Philosophy," Political A //airs , April, 1948.
> **Published by the Public Affairs Press, Washington, D.C., 1950.

1 23 objectivity of contradiction. Materialism without the dialectics of objective contra diction is idealism . If development does not take place by the overcoming of objective contradiction, then everything depends on the subject, the leaders, the elite, the bureauc racy. Zhdanov, the vulgar materialist, had therefore to demand that the philosophical workers produce a "new aspect of movement, a new type of development, a new dialectical law. " This exceptionally new, exceptionally sub jective, revision of Marxism was titled : "Criticism and Self Criticism : The Special Form of Struggle Between the Old and the New." Zhdanov stated unambiguously the inseparable connection between the new subjectivism and the Stalinist denial of the class struggle in Russia: "In our Soviet society, where antagonistic classes have been liquidated, the struggle between the old and the new, and consequently the development from the lower to the higher, proceeds not in the form of struggle between antag oni�tic classes and of cataclysms , as is the case under capital is ryi , but in the form of criticism and self-criticism, which is the real motive force of our development, a powerful instru ment in the hands of the Party. This is, incontestably, a new aspect of movement, a new type of development, a new dialectical law ." In 1 949, the Institute of Philosophy of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR delivered the new ideology which Zhdanov had ordered. * The development of Soviet society was identified with the consciousness, the theory, the plan, the policy, the foresight of the Communist Party, the Soviet state. The new idealism was proclaimed unequivocally : "Herein lies the strength and significance of our party, of scientific theory, of socialist consciousness. " The steps of Hegel's decline are here undeviatingly retraced. Hegel, who did not know the socialized proletariat,

began by regarding all history as the history of the philoso pher, of consciousness and self-consciousness, and ended with the state bureaucracy. The Stalinists use almost the identical phrases. The proletariat 's role in the struggle for socialism is to work harder and harder, while the leadership and organi zation are left to the "criticism and self-criticism" of the elite, the bureaucracy, the party. Everything depends on the party, on the bureaucracy's consciousness and self-conscious ness of correctness and incorrectness, its direction, its con trol, its foresight. The masses are merely at the disposal of the party as they are at the disposal of capital. This is the Stalinist philosophy in every sphere, political economy, politics, history, education, literature, art. The     

> History of the Communist Party of the So viet Union,

pub lished before World War II, was the first comprehensive statement of the primacy of the party, of political conscious ness over objective economic development, applied to the development of Russia before, during and after the revolu tion. In 1 943 Th e Teach ing of Political Economy in the Soviet Unio n was hailed as the reorganization by economists of all their work according to the model of the History . Since the end of World War II, and particularly with the philo sophic systematization of the new idealism in 1 94 7 , the ideological mobilization of the bureaucracy has been total. The Stalinist bureaucracy unambiguously proclaims the one party State of the Plan as the vital foundation of the Soviet system. To believe that this vigorous offensive in every sphere is a question of nationalism is a mistake as crippling as the belief that Stalinism betrays the revolution by social-patriotic support of the national state. In every country the Stalinists represent bureaucratic manipulation of the proletariat by the elite, the bureaucracy , the party. They are the extreme limit of the rationalism of the bourgeoisie, uncritical materialism and uncritical idealism. Never before has so gigantic a state

mobilized itself with such murderous vigilance to keep the proletariat at work while the leaders and organizers plan. This is the most deadly enemy the prole tariat has ever had. Rationalism and counter-revolution have become one. 

The Ideological Crisis of t he Intermediate Classes 

The totality of the crisis has given manifold forms to the counter-revolution. The most deadly, the most insidious, the most dangerous is the Stalinist counter-revolution be cause it springs from the proletariat and cloaks itself in Marxist terminology . The most obviously reactionary, the most easily recognizable is the counter-revolution of the middle classes. Because capitalism in its present stage, state capitalism, faces them with complete liquidation and absorp tion into the proletariat, they propose the complete destruc tion o f capitalism arid return to a new medievalism, based on natural inequality. This is the program of the Christian Hu .manists, militantly anti-rationalist, militantly anti-democratic. Like all forms of anti-rationalism, Christian Humanism leans heavily upon the Hegelian dialectic. The Hegelian con cept of o bjective contradiction the source of all dialectic - is transformed into a subjective conflict in the individual between sin and salvation, between individual imperfection and divine perfection. The crisis is moral and the solution must be moral, faith in divine authority. The Christian Humanists describe with brutal accuracy and prophetic dread the fragmentation of the workers in large-scale production and therein the threat to the very life of society. Nothing else could give them their crusading obsession that rationalism has reached its ultimate, the destruction of society itself. But the Christian Humanists cannot see the proletarian solution . That is the hopeless dilemma out of which they have created a philosophy of complete regression to religious idealism. 

1 26 

The Christian Humanists have a systematic political economy . They�propose dece ntralized self-governing corpora tions of private property with every worker in his place. They have a philosophy of history. They believe in the eternal ambiguities of the human situation and the impossibility of ever attaining human freedom on earth. They have a theory of p olitics. The natural and ideological elite must rule , the masses must not have absolute sovereignty. Since evil and imperfection are eternal, they say, the alternatives are either limited sovereignty or unmitigated authoritarianism. These are the philosophic values which have helped de Gasperi in Italy and the M .R.P. and de Gaulle in France to rally around them the desperate middle classes. In increasing numbers , established university intellectuals in the United States are attracted to the same conceptions, radiating from the University of Chicago . There are individual nuances among the Christian Humanists, but as an all-embracing philosophy, Christian Humanism prepares the middle classes to resist to the end the proletarian revolution and to adapt themselves at decisive moments to Fascism. (Of this Rausch ning in Germany has given eloquent testimony.) Hence, it is a useful weapon in the hands of big business and the dimin ishing magnates, so diminished today that more than ever they are dependent upon the middle classes for a mass base. In the United States, the Christian Humanists (for example, Peter Drucker) will join with the labor bureaucracy to keep the mass of workers in their place at the base of the hierarchy in production. For the workers Christian Humanism is no problem. Their degradation in production goes far beyond the moral capacity of any individual to aggravate or alleviate. They attack the labor bureaucracy for precisely that for which the Christian Humanists support it. However, for seducing intel lectuals by the wholesale repudiation o f rationalism and for attracting them to Fascism, Christian Humanism plays an important role in the war of ideologies springing from the 

1 27 total crisis in production today. The rationalism of the bourgeoisie has ended in the Stalinist one-party bureaucratic-administrative state of the Plan. In their repulsion from this rationalism and from the proletarian revolution , the middle classes fall back upon the barbarism of Fascism . The anti-Stalinist, anti-capitalist petty b ourgeois intellectuals, themselves the victims of the absolute division between mental and physical labor, do not know where to go or what to do. Unable to base themselves com pletely upon the modern proletariat , they turn inward, pursuing a self-destructive, soul-searching analysis of their own isolation , alienation and indecision. They too appro priate the Hegelian dialectic, interpreting it as an unceasing c onflict in the individual between affirmation and negation, between deciding for and deciding against. These intellectuals are the most cultivated in the mod ern world, in the sense of knowing the whole past of human culture. Having achieved what the idealism of Hegel posed as the Absolute, they are undergoing a theoretical disintegra tion without parallel in human history. In France this disin tegration has assumed the form of a literary movement , Existentialism. In America i t takes the form o f a mania for psychoanalysis, reaching in to all layers of society but nowhere more than among the most urbane, sensitive and cultivated individuals. In Germany the intellectuals cannot choose between Christian Humanism and p sychoanalysis, whether guilt or sickness is the root of the German catas trophe . This is total unreason, the disintegration of a society without values or perspective, the final climax to centuries of division of labor between the philosophers and the proletarians. 

Philosophy Must Become Proletarian 

There is no longer any purely philosophical answer to 

1 28 

all this. These philosophical questions, and very profound they are, Marxism says can be solved only by the revolution ary action of the p roletariat and the masses. There is and can be no other answer. As we have said , we do not propose to do right what the Stalinists have failed to do or do wrong. Progress in Russia, says 'Zhdanov, is criticism and self-criticism . The state Owns the property, therefore the proletariat must work and work and work. The proletarian revolution alone will put state-property in its place. In the United States the bourgeoisie extols all the advantages o f democracy, the bureaucracy those of science. The proletarian revolution alone will put science in its place and establish complete democracy. The evils that Christian Humanism sees, the problem of alienation, of mechanized existence, the alienated Existen tialist, the alienated worker, internationalism, peace all are ultimate problems and beyond the reach of any ideological 

solution. The revolution, the mass proletarian revolution, the creativity of the masses, everything begins here. This is 

Reason today. The great philosophical problems have bogged down in the mire of Heidigger, Existentialism, psychoanaly sis, or are brutally "planned" by the bureaucracies. They can be solved only in the revolutionary reason of the masses. This is what Lenin made into a universal as early as the 1 90 5 

Revolution : "The point is that it is precisely the revolutionary peri ods that are distinguished for their greater breadth, greater wealth, greater intelligence, greater and more systematic activity, greater audacity and vividness of historical creative ness, compared with periods of philistine, Cadet reformist progress. " He drove home the opposition between bourgeois reason and proletariat reason: "But Mr. Blank and Co . picture it the other way about. They pass off poverty as historical-creative wealth. They 

1 29 regard the inactivity of the suppressed, downtrodden masses as the triumph of the 'systematic' activity of the bureaucrats and the bourgeoisie. They shout about the disappearance o f sense and reason, when the picking t o pieces o f parliamentary bills by all sorts of bureaucrats and liberal 'penny-a-liners' gives way to a period of direct political activity by t �e 'co �

mon people,' who in their simple way directly and ImmedI ately destroy the organs of oppression of the people, seize power, appropriate for themselves what was considered :0 

be the property of all sorts of plunderers of the people m

a word, precisely when the sense and reason of millions of downtrodden people is awakening, not only for reading books but for action, for living human action, for historical creativeness." (Selected Works, Vol. VII, p. 2 6 1 .) That was the first Russian Revolution. In the Second the proletariat created the form of its political and social rule. Now the whole development of the objective situation demands the fully liberated historical creativeness of the masses, their sense and reason, a new and higher organization of labor, new social ties, associated humanity . That is the solution to the problems of production and to the problems of philosophy. Philosophy must become proletarian. Yet there is a philosophical task in itself strictly philo sophical. The doctrine of negativity and the whole system of Hegel, the specific doctrines of Marx, philosophical, political economy, party, all are geared to precisely this situation , this impasse in every sphere which only the prole tarian revolution can solve. This is the task today, and politically and philosophically you cannot separate it from production. The field is open, the proletariat, in so far as it is ready to listen, is willing to hear this. Organized schools of bourgeois thought are vulnerable from head to foot. In France, philosophers, historians, scientists, and writers are active protagonists in heated debates over humanism (is it the total rationalism of Stalinism, or Christian Humanism , or Existentialism?); which of the three is the heir to Hegel?

Often intellectuals tum toward Marx and Lenin and Hegel. They meet Stalinism which spends incredible time, care, energy and vigilance in holding Marx and Lenin within the bounds of their private-property state-property philos ophy. The Stalinists repeat interminably that dialectics is the transformation of quantity into quality, leaps, breaks in continuity, opposition of capitalism and socialism. It is part and parcel of their determination to represent state-property as revolutionary. In 1 9 1 7 , when the struggle in the working class movement was between reform and revolution, these conceptions may have been debatable. Today all arguments fade into insignificance in face of the actuality. The critical question today, which the Stalinists must avoid like the revo lution, is how was the October Revolution transformed into its opposite, the Stalinist counter-revolution, and how is this counter-revolution in tum to be transformed into its opposite. This is the dialectical law which Lenin mastered between 1 9 1 4 and 1 9 1 7 , the negation of the negation, the self-mobilization of the proletariat as the economics and politics of socialism . The Stalinist bureaucracy is determined that not a hint of the revolutionary doctrines of Hegel, Marx, Lenin should ever go out without its imprint, its interpretation . The social cooperativeness and unity of modern labor does not allow it any laxity from its cruel and merciless state-capitalist need to make the workers work harder and harder. No hint of the  

> revolu tionary

struggle against bureaucracy must come to workers or to questing intellectuals. Yet every strand of Marx's and Lenin's methodology, philosophy, political econ omy , lead today directly to the destruction of bureaucracy as such. Some petty-bourgeois professors and students, theoreti cally , in history, philosophy and literature, are struggling through to a Marxist solution. The proletariat constantly tries to create itself as the state, i.e . , no state at all. But Sta linism is the deadly enemy of both. It is the armed conscious 

> 1 3 1

active counter-revolution. The proletariat, like every organism, must from itself and its conditions develop its own antagonisms and its own means of overcoming them. Stalinism is the decay of world capitalism , a state-capitalism within the proletariat itself and is in essence no more than an expression within the pro letariat of the violent and insoluble tensions of capitalism at the stage of state-capitalism. One of the most urgent tasks 

is to trace the evolution of the counter-revolution within the revolution , from liberalism through anarchism, Social Democracy, Noske, counter-revolutionary Menshevism, to Stalinism, its economic and social roots at each stage, its political manifestations, its contradictions and antagonisms. Unless Stalinism is attacked as the most potent mode o f the counter-revolution, the counter-revolution o f our epoch, it cannot be seriously attacked. But once this conception is grasped in all its implications, philosophical and methodo logical, then Stalinism and its methods, its principles, its 

aims, can be dealt a series of expanding blows against which it has no defense except slander and assassination. Our document gives only a faint outline of the tremendous scope of the revolutionary attack on Stalinism which the theory of state-capitalism opens up. It is the very nature of our age which brings philosophy from Lenin's study in 1 9 1 4 to the very forefront of the struggle for the remaking of the world. 

Orthodox Trotskyism From all this the Fourth International has cut itself o ff by its state-property theory . The philosophical root of Trotsky's mistake is not new, it is not difficult when fully explained. The categories, the forms established by the proletarian revolution in 1 9 1 7 , he took as permanent, fixed. The October Revolution had undoubtedly manifested itself most strikingly in opposition 

1 3 2 

to bourgeois society by the abolition of private property and the institution of planning in the sense of ability to direct "capital." Trotsky drew the conclusion that this was the distinguishing mark of the proletarian revolution . The re formist bureaucracy was attached to private property, defense of the national state, slavishly served the bourgeoisie, capitulated to it in crisis. He drew the conclusion that all labor bureaucracies in the future would do the same, more or less. The revolutionary party established state-property and was defeatist toward the national state. Hence only revo lutionary parties could do the same. Trotsky did not recog nize that although the October Revolution took these forms, the forms were not permanent. There were antagonisms within them which would grow and develop with the class struggle, presenting the revolution in new modes. His philo sophical method is known and clearly defined by Hegel -the method of synthetic cognition. Today, the reading of Lenin shows that he never at any time allowed himself to slip from seeing socialism as prole tarian power, using all necessary and objective forms but carefully distinguishing the fundamental universal of prole tarian power from the concrete molds into which history had forced that specific revolution. For Lenin the readiness of Russia for socialism was the appearance of the Soviet, a new form of social organization. Trotsky, however, did not see what took place between 

1 944 and today. He is not in any way responsible for the philosophical methods of Pablo and Germain. Pablo has simply SUbstituted degeneration for the universal of proletarian power. This road is the road to ruin whether by way of Stalinism or otherwise. Lenin's State and R evolution is not a "norm ." It was the universal drawn from analysis of the class struggle on a world scale and generalized. It was an indispensable necessity of thought, by means of which Lenin could grasp the concrete reality of 1 9 1 7. 

Thought is and must be a relation between the class, in our 

1 33 case the proletariat, the concrete conditions (Russia in 1 9 1 7) and the universal. Without the universal of proletarian democracy, as Lenin pointed out with the utmost emphasis in 1 9 1 6 against the imperialist economists, the bourgeois crisis produces inevitably a "depression or suppression of human reasoning." There is only "the efffIct of the horrible impressions, the painful consequences. . . ." Lenin was not talking psychology. It was, he insisted, the method of 

thought which was at stake. In 1 9 50 the universal is as far beyond 1 9 1 7 as 1 9 1 7 was beyond the Paris Commune. A serious analysis of Stalin ism will show that it is precisely the advanced objective relations of society which compel the counter-revolution to assume this form and dress itself in Marxism, fake action committees and all. We have to draw a new universal, more concrete and embracing more creative freedom of the masses than even State and R evolution. 

I t i s at this time that Pablo not only fails t o d o so but repudiates State and Revolution, proposing instead that pro letarian politics be guided for centuries by the barbarous degradation in Russia and in the buffer states of Eastern Europe. It is the end of any philosophic method and the most serious of all theories of retrogression. In this mentality can be seen the germs which in maturity make the complete Stalinist - absolute hostility to capitalism as we have known it but a resigned acceptance that Marx's and Lenin's ideas of proletarian power are Utopian. No more deadly deviation has ever appeared in our movement. Germain has no philosophical method for which we can spare space and time. He bounces from side to side, affirming theories, dropping them and building new ones, listing innumerable possibilities, analyzing not the laws of capitalism but Outer Mongolia and the decrees of Mussolini in Northern Italy, gripped in that most terrible of all logics, the logic of empiricism ; effective only in this important sense that his undisciplined verbiage and shifting generalizations prepare 1 34 minds for some such brutal solution as Pablo's. In a dark time Trotskyism maintained the continuity and struggled for the essentials of Bolshevism. Its errors are not irreparable. Today it faces two road s : Pablo's road and the road of "Johnson-Forest." The longer the hesitation , the greater the price that will b e paid.
