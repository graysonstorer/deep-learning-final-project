CARACAS, Venezuela

SLIP into Librerías del Sur, a chain of [state bookstores](http://ciudadccs.info/?p=88610 "Cuidad CCS story in Spanish on state bookstores"). Read a state newspaper. Turn on state television. Listen to [state radio](http://www.rnv.gov.ve/noticias/index.php?act=ST&f=31&t=142953 "State radio article on Ms. Golinger"). Eva Golinger, a New Yorker who speaks Spanish with a thick American accent, seems to be expounding everywhere these days on the threats to this country’s so-called “Bolivarian revolution.”

Welcomed into President Hugo Chávez’s fold to such an extent that she accompanied him on a recent trip to Iran, Libya and Syria, Ms. Golinger, a lawyer who first came to Venezuela in the 1990s to research her family’s history, has created a unique niche for herself here: an American with the president’s ear.
