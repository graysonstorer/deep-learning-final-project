Abstract 

This Reply, while confirming that Stalin's policies were ruthless and brutal, shows that there are no 

serious grounds for Ellman's view that Stalin pursued a conscious policy of starvation of the peasants 

during the famine. It also rejects Ellman's claim that in their recent book [Davies and Wheatcroft 

(2004)] the authors neglect Soviet policy and leadership perceptions in their account of the famine. 

IN HIS ARTICLE IN EUROPE-ASIA STUDIES, MICHAEL ELLMAN (2005) criticises our book 

The Years of Hunger. Soviet Agriculture, 1931-1933 (Davies & Wheatcroft 2004) on 

the grounds that we concentrate on 'impersonal structural and agronomic factors' 

rather than dealing with Bolshevik policy. He advises us that, in order to have a 

complete understanding of the famine, it is also 'necessary to look closely ... at the 

perception of the situation by the vozhd' himself (Ellman 2005, p. 824). 

In contrast to our alleged approach, he claims that 'there is some evidence that in 

1930-33... Stalin also used starvation in his war against the peasants', 'in other 

words ... a conscious policy of starvation', and he frequently refers to 'the starvation 

policy of 1932-33' (Ellman 2005, p. 825). [He acknowledges, however, that 'it is 

entirely possible that ... the intended deaths were only a small possibly very small 

proportion' (Ellman 2005, p. 834)]. In a rather ambiguous discussion of the place of 

this alleged policy in the long-term trends in Bolshevik perceptions, he also argues in 

terms of a continuum between Lenin's attitude to the 1891-92 famine and Stalin's 

handling of the 1932-33 famine (Ellman 2005, pp. 831-832). 

In this reply we first summarise our own approach to the famine and then discuss 

Ellman's assessment of the role of deliberate starvation. Ellman's account of our views

is extremely distorted. We certainly stress the importance of structural and agronomic 

factors. But the perceptions of Stalin personally, the leadership as a whole, and the 

party activists, are also central objects of our attention, as well as the 'impersonal 

factors'. In the final paragraph of our book, for example, we specifically state that 

'Stalin's policy towards the peasants was ruthless and brutal' and among other factors 

influencing agricultural policies we refer to 'the modus operandi of the Soviet system as 

it was established under Stalin' (Davies & Wheatcroft 2004, p. 441). We do hold that 

the famine of 1931-33 had important features in common with other famines, but 

Ellman's assertion that 'Davies and Wheatcroft argue that the 1931-34 famine was 

not a unique event necessitating a unique explanation' is a travesty of our position 

(Ellman 2005, p. 834). 

What is our own view of the role of Bolshevik perceptions and misperceptions as a 

background to the famine? First, we regard the policy of rapid industrialisation as an 

underlying cause of the agricultural troubles of the early 1930s, and we do not believe 

that the Chinese or NEP versions of industrialisation were viable in Soviet national and 

international circumstances. However, contrary to Ellman's imputation, we do not 

consider that industrialisation policy took the only possible form. Volumes 3 and 4 of 

The Industrialisation of Soviet Russia show that at the end of the 1920s the Soviet Union 

adopted a particular form of what Ellman oversimplifies as 'the tribute model of 

industrialisation' (Ellman 2005, p. 836, n. 4). Investment and production plans in 

1929-31 were not merely high, they were unfeasibly high, leading to a waste of 

resources, and involving the closing down and truncating of over-ambitious projects. 

Secondly, Volumes 1 and 2 of Industrialisation, together with Years of Hunger, show 

in considerable detail the major misperceptions of agriculture that influenced Soviet 

policy. From 1929 onwards, it was assumed that a huge growth of agricultural 

machinery would be sufficient to replace horses within a few years, and that 

agricultural prosperity would enable the household plot to be eliminated in favour of 

fully socialised agriculture. As late as the spring and summer of 1931, the authorities, 

including Stalin personally, believed that a record harvest would occur in that year, 

and enable livestock to be socialised and meat and dairy production to increase 

rapidly. 

These optimistic assumptions at first led to the conclusion that most peasants would 

support collectivisation, opposed only by a small number of kulaks. In 1930 and 1931 

kulaks and other opponents of collectivisation were ruthlessly persecuted, but these 

measures were seen as compatible with and a prerequisite for rapid agricultural 

development. These erroneous policies and assumptions played a major part, together 

with 'structural and conjunctural factors', in bringing about the agricultural disaster of 

## 1932-33.1 

By the summer of 1932, partly as a result of previous Soviet policies, and partly as a 

result of bad weather, there had been two bad harvests in succession. Although 

strenuous efforts had been made to build up reserve stocks, these efforts had failed 

completely (see Davies et al. 1995, pp. 642-657). There is no doubt that grain was in 

very short supply by the spring and summer of 1932. Most of the urban population

were hungry; and the death rate in the towns rose sharply. The reduction in urban 

bread rations led to the large-scale riots of textile workers in Ivanovo region.2 

As the scale of the agricultural crisis became more obvious to the party leaders, they 

launched changes in policy that they hoped would alleviate the position of the peasants. 

In May 1932 the government adopted reforms (known as Neo-Nep) which 

incorporated lower central grain collection targets (especially for Ukraine which was 

1.3 million tons lower than the 1931/32 plan) and legalised the kolkhoz market. 

The collection plan from the 1932 harvest was reduced in a series of measures from 23.5 

to 19.6 million tons, and the actual amount collected was 18.5 million tons. On 17 

August 1932, the Ukrainian grain collection plan for the peasant sector (i.e. excluding 

the state farms) was reduced by 0.6 million tons, on 30 October by a further 0.9 million 

tons, and on 12 January 1933 by another 0.5 million tons. The initial Ukrainian plan for 

the peasant sector was 5.83 million tons as compared with the 6.47 million tons 

collected from the previous harvest, and the final plan was only 3.77 million tons (3.53 

million were actually collected). Similarly the North Caucasus plan was reduced from 

2.52 to 1.59 million tons. Once the famine was under way the Politburo, in no fewer 

than 35 top-secret decisions, issued between February and July 1933, provided small 

amounts of food to the countryside, primarily to Ukraine and North Caucasus. 

These substantial changes in plan were insufficient to avoid mass starvation, but 

they do indicate that the government was trying to do something (though not enough) 

to reduce the terrible impact of the famine in Ukraine and North Caucasus. The 

reduction in the collections as compared with the previous year meant that the bread 

rations in the towns had to be drastically cut. Many workers received at best a near 

starvation bread ration in the spring of 1933.3 In June and July 1933, urban death rate 

indicators were double the normal level in the Russian Republic and more than this in 

Ukraine.4 Grain exports a major means of paying for machinery imports were 

reduced from 4.8 million tons in 1931/32 to only 1.8 million tons in 1932/33. The initial 

plan was to export 6.2 million tons from the 1932 harvest! The plan to build up 

substantial reserve stocks of grain was also largely abandoned. The effort to build up 

stocks had been pursued with particular vigour from the autumn of 1931, when the 

military threat from Japan loomed over the USSR. As late as 9 December 1932, in 

spite of the difficulties with the grain collections, the revised grain plan approved by 

the Politburo proposed that stocks should amount to 3.7 million tons on 1 July 1933, at 

> the end of the agricultural year. In fact they amounted to at most 2 million tons, less than

on the same date three years previously. This was less than two months' supply for 

internal use. The food crisis in the towns, the reduced exports at a time of serious balance 

of payments difficulties, and the failure to build up grain stocks were all consequences of 

a grave crisis of grain shortage, not one simulated for political purposes. The decline in 

the grain collections and the subsequent crisis amounted to a major defeat for 

government policy, and partly for this reason was not admitted in public. 

Even the reduced grain collection plan was achieved only by the use of a great deal 

of force. The Soviet leaders, confronted with the large grain deficit of the winter and

spring of 1932/33, as on previous occasions, but with greater ferocity, falsely 

attributed the shortages to the kulaks and to wider sections of the peasantry who 

were assumed to have been influenced by them. 

What in our opinion was Stalin's personal role in these events? In contrast to 

Ellman, who treats Stalin's perceptions of the peasants and of famine as 

continuous with those of Lenin, and basically unchanging, we endorse Kagano 

vich's famous precept that 'there were various Stalins ... Before 1932 he was 

entirely different' (Chuev 1998, p. 154). We pay particular attention to the major 

changes in Stalin's perceptions during the stormy years of rapid industrialisation 

which preceded the famine. It is true that Stalin's attitude to the peasants was far 

from positive; he always regarded them as second-class citizens.5 But both his 

public and private statements in the mid- and late-1920s perhaps even as late as 

the spring of 1932 show that he was convinced that Bolshevik policy would 

lead rapidly to a large increase in agricultural production and a rise in the 

standard of living of the peasants as well as the urban population. Before the 

onset of agricultural crisis in 1931, the possibility of large-scale peasant hunger, 

let alone starvation, played no part in Stalin's perception, and would have been 

dismissed by him as counter-revolutionary propaganda. Even at the time of the 

1932 harvest he continued to assert that grain production was higher than in the 

previous year. 

> In 1932/33 Stalin was closely identified with most of the measures adopted during the

agricultural crisis and the famine. He personally endorsed, and often specifically 

proposed, all the decisions on the reduction of the grain collections and the allocation 

of grain to the famine-stricken areas. But he also initiated and endorsed the measures 

involving the large-scale use of force. He certainly took a hard line. For example, 

he personally initiated and pushed through the Politburo the notorious decree of 

> 7 August 1932, imposing the death penalty for the theft of grain [see Stalin - Kaganovich

(2001, pp. 235-236) and the accompanying documents]. He was extremely nervous 

about the situation in Ukraine, writing to Kaganovich on 11 August 1932: 'We may 

> lose Ukraine'. He certainly believed that the famine was the peasants' own fault. In this

context he committed a crime of omission. He was entirely unwilling to admit the 

failure of his policies. While grain exports were cut, Stalin made no effort to secure 

grain assistance from abroad, partly because of the severe foreign exchange crisis, 

but also because this would have exposed Soviet claims about the success of 

> collectivisation. He was more concerned with the fate of industrialisation than with the

lives of the peasants. 

However, we have found no evidence, either direct or indirect, that Stalin sought 

deliberately to starve the peasants. The top-secret decisions of the Politburo, 

endorsed by Stalin, never hint at a policy of deliberate starvation. Moreover, in their 

most secret letters and telegrams to Stalin, his closest associates Molotov and 

Kaganovich treat hunger and death from famine as an evil for which the kulaks or 

wider sections of the peasants, and inefficient local organisation, are largely 

responsible, but which must be mitigated as far as possible by local and central 

measures. In his letter of 15 March 1933, which Ellman cites, the Ukrainian party

leader Kosior, while blaming the peasants for the famine, and arguing that they 

should learn in future to work harder, at the same time set out measures by which 

the local authorities should reduce the impact of the famine by supplying the 

population with additional food from local resources. The letter concludes with an 

urgent request for the supply of food grain from central funds, including an 

additional immediate supply for the Kiev region.6 This is not the kind of letter that 

would be addressed to a Stalin who was known to be secretly calling for the 

starvation of the peasants. Similarly the documents prepared in the OGPU about the 

famine criticise the local authorities for removing the food stocks of the peasantry 

and treat such behaviour as a violation of the party line. The authors of these 

documents evidently did not know that Stalin was pursuing a starvation policy. But 

if neither the central nor the local party leaders, nor the OGPU, knew of the 

existence of this policy, how could it be put into effect? 

Our view of Stalin and the famine is close to that of Robert Conquest, who would 

earlier have been considered the champion of the argument that Stalin had 

intentionally caused the famine and had acted in a genocidal manner. In 2003, 

Dr Conquest wrote to us explaining that he does not hold the view that 'Stalin 

purposely inflicted the 1933 famine. No. What I argue is that with resulting famine 

imminent, he could have prevented it, but put "Soviet interest" other than feeding the 

starving first thus consciously abetting it'.7 

We now turn to the various arguments put forward by Ellman in favour of the view 

that Stalin deliberately starved the peasants. 

Continuity between Lenin and Stalin 

Ellman claims that there was a continuity in the attitude to famine between Lenin and 

Stalin, both of whom, he alleges, regarded famines (or possibly just their con 

sequences) as progressive (Ellman 2005, p. 832). On this basis he holds that the 

'political structural factor' which led to the 1931-34 famine 'was the communist 

victory in the Civil War and the resulting Communist dictatorship' (Ellman 2005, 

p. 829), rather than being a result of the Stalinist version of that dictatorship. 

But, as Ellman hints in passing (Ellman 2005, p. 824), there was a major famine in 

1921-22 and the attitude and policy of the regime, and of Lenin personally, 

towards this famine was entirely different from Stalin's a decade later. The famine was 

openly acknowledged and substantial foreign, particularly American, aid saved many 

lives. 

The plans for mass deportations in 1933 

Ellman argues (Ellman 2005, pp. 830-831) that the planned mass deportations in 

1933 were a major part of Stalin's call on 27 November 1932 for a 'crushing blow' 

against the resistance of what Stalin referred to as 'certain collective farmers and

collective farms'.8 He then claims that (Ellman 2005, p. 831) the near-abandonment of 

this scheme provides 'circumstantial evidence' that Stalin decided that starving 

the peasants was a more efficient means of eliminating 'class enemies'.9 In fact, 

the plans for mass deportation were abandoned because of the unwillingness and 

inability of the regional authorities to assimilate such a large number of people, and 

because of the disasters that ensued, including the Nazino tragedy. Oleg Khlevnyuk 

concludes that these disasters 'apparently... completely discredited the labor exile 

plans in the eyes of the supreme leadership' (Khlevnyuk 2004, chapter 2, especially 

## p. 67). 

We also very much doubt that Stalin believed that the deaths from famine in the first 

half of 1933 had served the function of getting rid of an adequate number of class 

enemies. He surely knew that these deaths occurred among a very large variety of 

different types of peasants, including ordinary collective farmers, and that if there 

were kulaks in the villages-many of them would have remained, in those areas less 

affected by the famine. 

The argument from authority 

Ellman attaches great weight to the views expressed by our late colleague Viktor 

Danilov, even erecting a kind of 'cult of personality' in support of his arguments. He 

states that 'in addition to the evidence presented in this reply, there is also the 

argument from authority (the late Viktor Danilov)' (Ellman 2005, pp. 835, 843). 

Fortunately we do not have a Pope in the study of Soviet history, and Danilov 

would certainly have resented this attitude to his work. The authors of this reply 

worked with Danilov over many years. One of us first became acquainted with him 

in 1963, then met him frequently in the next 40 years in good times and bad, and 

was very close to him both personally and academically. He was a great historian 

who made an outstanding contribution to our knowledge of the Russian and Soviet 

peasantry. But there is no doubt that his understandable bitterness about Stalin and 

Stalinism, which he regarded as a betrayal of socialism and the October Revolution, 

sometimes over-influenced his conclusions. On one famous occasion, he wrote a 

draft article that misinterpreted the statistics of grain stocks in 1933 which he found 

in the archives, and wrongly stated that the stocks were very high in July 1933 (4.53

million tons!) (see Davies et al. 1995, pp. 642-643). Danilov never submitted this 

article for publication, but for a time this mistake played a substantial role in the 

debate about whether Stalin deliberately organised the famine. And, in spite of 

lengthy and frequent discussions with the two of us about the 1932 harvest, Danilov 

appears to have deferred on this matter to the view of his colleague Zelenin, who 

kept reverting to the mistaken view that the 1932 harvest was larger than the harvest 

of the previous year. 

'Accusation in a mirror' 

Ellman attaches great importance to the concept that Stalin denied his own action in 

deliberately starving the peasants by projecting it on to others. In a revealing footnote, 

he states that 'I too belonged to the "unintentional" school' before Karel G. Berkhoff 

drew his attention to Stalin's 'accusation in a mirror' (Ellman 2005, p. 837, n. 15). But 

'accusation in a mirror' is only a rather different way of describing Stalin's very well 

known use of scapegoats.10 Stalin put the blame on scapegoats in several different 

contexts. On 2 March 1930, he published his article 'Dizzy with Success' to cover 

up his responsibility for the unexpectedly unfavourable results of 'excesses' in 

collectivisation by blaming them on others (in this case the local officials) and also to 

announce and claim credit for the decision to soften the collectivisation policy. In the 

case of the Katyn murders, he denied an action that he had consciously and deliberately 

authorised by blaming it on others (in this case the Nazis), but without any change in 

policy. Ellman appears to regard Stalin's statement to Sholokhov in May 1933 

blaming peasants for seeking to starve the workers and the army as analogous to the 

denial of the Katyn murders according to Ellman, Stalin was projecting on to the 

peasants the starvation which he had deliberately organised (Ellman 2005, pp. 824, 

826- 827). But the situations are different. In the case of Katyn we have the record of 

the explicit proposal to the Politburo which was endorsed by Stalin; the Politburo then 

secretly organised the executions. In the case of the famine there are no proposals to 

organise starvation, no orders, no signs of any central actions directed towards this 

aim. On the contrary, there were many top-secret Politburo decisions albeit very 

inadequate-which sought to save lives. A more appropriate analogy seems to be with 

'Dizzy with Success'. In the autumn and winter of 1929-30 Stalin encouraged actions 

that were certainly not intended to bring about large-scale peasant unrest; he then in 

March 1930 blamed the local officials for the unintended consequences of his actions. 

Similarly, his previous actions played a large part in bringing about the famine of the 

winter and spring of 1932-33, but he then blamed 'a minority' of the peasants for 

the famine. 

Another aspect of Stalin's 'scapegoatism' is worth noting. It is only the naming 

of scapegoats before the event that can be adduced as evidence of a guilty intention. 

Scapegoating after the event is evidence only of a wish to escape blame for the 

consequences of a policy. But the letter to Sholokhov in May 1933 was written not

before the event but only when the famine had already reached its peak, and the 

speech of May 1935 was made two years after the event [pace Ellman (2005, p. 832), 

this speech in any case cannot be interpreted as justifying famine]. This is very weak 

evidence indeed of Stalin's intention to cause starvation. 

Ellman's proposal to estimate the number of peasants deliberately starved by Stalin 

Ellman seems to think that it would be relatively easy to assess whether Stalin did 

intentionally attempt to starve the peasants. He claims that (Ellman 2005, p. 834) 

'in principle, it would be possible to make estimates of the relative importance' of 

(a) 'exogenous non-policy-related factors', (b) 'policies ... which had excess deaths as 

an unintended consequence', and (c) 'policies aimed at killing people' shootings and 

starvation. This would be achieved by 'a model of the factors determining agricultural 

output and mortality in this period'. According to Ellman, such work is 'a challenge 

for the future' (Ellman 2005, p. 834) and 'a fruitful area for further research' (Ellman 

2005, p. 835). 

We look forward to the results of Ellman's endeavours in this direction but we 

venture to suggest that death is a complex phenomenon that is the result of many 

> interacting causes. Part of the population would have died in these years under normal

circumstances (whatever may have counted as normal). Ellman will need to assess the 

causation of excess mortality and to assign it to the separate types of causes. It will be 

difficult enough-to separate out the level of excess deaths caused by exogenous non 

policy related factors, and those unintended deaths caused by policies. But how would 

he know what policies were meant to starve people to death, as this was nowhere 

stated to be the intent, and how would he be able to assess the extent to which this 

occurred and separate it from normal mortality and the mortality caused by other 

factors that were also contributing to food shortages? 

In our view, it will be inherently impossible to estimate the number of deaths from 

the numerous policy decisions approved by Stalin, even if they were intended to 

produce starvation. Usually basing himself on the recommendations of the Committee 

for Agricultural Collections (Komzag), Stalin sometimes approved proposals to reduce 

the amount of grain to be collected from a region or republic, or to allocate grain to a 

region as seed, food or fodder, and sometimes rejected them. Decisions to refuse grain 

to a region or to insist on fulfilment of the delivery quota sometimes resulted in 

starvation. It would be very difficult to work out how far deaths in a region were the 

result of a particular decision. But even if this proved possible, there is no way of 

knowing why Stalin took a particular decision: did he believe it to be essential because 

otherwise the towns would starve? Did he wrongly believe that peasants in the region 

had hidden stores of grain? Or did he positively want peasants to starve to death, as 

Ellman hypothesises? It seems to us that Ellman's proposal to estimate the deaths 

caused by the alleged 'starvation policy' is non-operational. 

Ellman's rash conclusions 

In his conclusions Ellman abandons caution and presents as established fact a series 

of propositions which are presented much more tentatively in the body of the article

(Ellman 2005, pp. 834-835). According to Ellman, the party leaders 'regarded it 

[the famine] as a necessary cost of the progressive policies of industrialisation 

and the building of socialism under conditions of fierce class warfare ... it was just 

one aspect of a necessary policy of attracting resources from agriculture for 

industrialisation' (Ellman 2005, p. 835). The evidence for this presented by Ellman 

is negligible. 

Ellman then explains that the famine, according to the party leaders, 'also [1] 

eliminated class enemies more efficiently than deportation, [2] improved the grain 

balance by reducing rural overpopulation, and [3] was a disciplinary measure which 

made a useful contribution to socialising the rural population'.11 Ellman presents no 

evidence whatsoever that the leaders believed propositions [1] and [2]. With regard to 

proposition [3], some leaders certainly stated that the peasants had come to realise that 

if they did not work they would starve but no one said or hinted that starvation was 

imposed as a disciplinary measure. Ellman explains that his exposition is important 'for 

non-specialists unfamiliar with Bolshevik thinking'. Non-specialists should be warned 

that Ellman's version of Bolshevik thinking (Ellman 2005, p. 835) is a house of cards 

erected on extremely shaky evidence. 

Why should we take trouble to resist the charge that Stalin deliberately starved the 

peasants? After all, our book-though Ellman appears to deny this provides a mass 

of evidence that Stalin's policies towards the peasants were ruthless and brutal. Stalin 

was a dictator, and bore more responsibility for the famine than any other individual. 

But it seems to us important to establish how far the famine was a consequence of the 

workings of the institutions established under Stalin and how far it was the outcome of 

the exceptionally vicious personality of the ruler. Ellman has taken a step backwards 

in the study of the subject by turning attention towards speculation about the inner 

workings of Stalin's mind and away from examining his actual decisions, and 

analysing their intended and unintended results.
