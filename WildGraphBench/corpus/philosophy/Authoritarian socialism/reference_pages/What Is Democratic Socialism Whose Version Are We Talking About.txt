Democratic socialism has become a major force in American political life. Just look at [Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who is planning a national address](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/us/politics/bernie-sanders-socialism.html) on Wednesday on what it is and why he believes it’s needed.

Yet if you ask five self-described democratic socialists what the term means, you’re likely to get five different answers. Here’s why.

Democratic socialism has a definition …
---------------------------------------

Political theory isn’t exactly a crowd-pleaser on the campaign trail, but you need some of it to understand why “democratic socialism” means so many things to so many people.

Leftist political theory encompasses a wide range of ideologies, which can be divided roughly into three categories.

**Communism** is what existed in the Soviet Union and still exists in China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea and Vietnam. It isn’t monolithic, but the common thread is a fully centralized economy achieved through revolution.

This is the image some critics evoke against less radical ideologies, as the “Fox & Friends” co-host Pete Hegseth did when he called Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s $15 minimum wage for her staff “socialism and communism on display.” In reality, no federal official or Democratic candidate advocates communism.
