In January 1958, Mao Zedong launched the second Five-Year Plan known as the [Great Leap Forward](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward), a plan intended as an alternative model for economic growth to the Soviet model focusing on heavy industry that was advocated by others in the party. In the following three years, a widespread famine was caused. [Liu Shaoqi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liu_Shaoqi) and [Deng Xiaoping](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deng_Xiaoping), then the State President and General Secretary, respectively, rescued the economy by disbanding the people’s communes, introducing elements of private control of peasant smallholdings and importing grain from Canada and Australia to mitigate the worst effects of famine.

Facing the prospect of losing his place on the political stage, Mao responded to Liu and Deng’s movements by launching the [Cultural Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution) in 1966. Chaos reigned over the country, and millions were prosecuted as they were labeled as class enemies who had certain liberal “bourgeois” elements of society and considered a threat to the socialist framework.

The Revolution led to the destruction of much of China’s cultural heritage and the imprisonment of a huge number of Chinese citizens, as well as creating general economic and social chaos in the country. By his death in 1976, the society and economy had already suffered a severe retrogress and came to the edge of collapse. At the very urgent moment, the 3rd Session of the 11th CPC(Communism Party of China) Meeting held in late 1978, eventually turned the government work pivot back to the socialism construction from class contend, and also finalized the extreme cult of Mao by setting up the standard _be practical and realistic_.

Although Mao Zedong made serious mistakes in his late years, from the aspect of whole life, his achievement for Chinese revolution is considered primary, the errors are secondary. He is still honored by Chinese people. Five years later after his death, his contribution and mistakes were roundly summarized and evaluated by CPC [![Image 3: maoandhiscalligraphy thumb Chinese Leader Mao Zedong / Part II](http://blog.eteacherchinese.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/maoandhiscalligraphy-thumb.jpg)](http://blog.eteacherchinese.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/maoandhiscalligraphy.jpg)Central Committee with a form of final resolution and his major political theory, [Maoism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism), was held as the guideline of CPC all the same from the final resolution.
