-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The country classification in the _World Economic Outlook_ divides the world into two major groups: advanced economies and emerging and developing economies. Please refer to the introduction to the WEO's Statistical Appendix for details. This classification is not based on strict criteria, economic or otherwise, but instead has evolved over time with the objective of facilitating analysis by providing a reasonably meaningful organization of the data.

Some countries remain outside the country classification and therefore are not included in the analysis. Anguilla, Cuba, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and Montserrat are examples of countries that are not IMF members, and their economies therefore are not monitored by the IMF.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Composite data for country groups in the _World Economic Outlook_ are either sums or weighted averages of data for individual countries. All historical and projected data are recalculated to reflect changes in country group composition in order to ensure that the economic indicators reflect changes in economic conditions and not changes in the country group composition. Arithmetically weighted averages are used for all data except inflation for the other emerging market and developing country group—except data on inflation, for which geometric averages are used. The following conventions apply.

*   Country group composites for interest rates, and growth rates of monetary aggregates are weighted by GDP converted to US dollars at market exchange rates (averaged over the preceding three years) as a share of group GDP.
*   Composites for other data relating to the domestic economy, whether growth rates or ratios, are weighted by GDP valued at purchasing power parities (PPPs) as a share of total world or group GDP. Annual inflation rates are simple percent change from previous years, except in the case of other emerging market and developing countries for which the rates are based on logarithmic differences (see the [FAQ](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/faq.htm) for more details).
*   Composites for real GDP per capita in _purchasing power parity_ terms are sums of individual country data after conversion to the international dollar in the years indicated.
*   Unless noted otherwise, composites for all sectors for the euro area are corrected for reporting discrepancies in intra-area transactions. Unadjusted annual GDP data are used for the euro area and for the majority of individual countries, except for Cyprus, Germany, Ireland, and Portugal, which report calendar adjusted data. For data prior to 1999, data aggregations apply 1995 European currency unit exchange rates.
*   Composite unemployment rates are weighted by labor force as a share of group labor force.
*   Composites relating to the external economy are sums of individual country data after conversion to US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the years indicated for balance of payments data and at end-of-year market exchange rates for debt denominated in currencies other than US dollars.
*   Composites of changes in foreign trade volumes and prices, however, are arithmetic averages of percentage changes for individual countries weighted by the US dollar value of exports or imports as a share of total world or group exports or imports (in the preceding year).
*   Composites for fiscal data are sums of individual country data after conversion to US dollars at the average market exchange rates in the years indicated.
*   Unless noted otherwise, group composites are computed if 90 percent or more of the share of group weights is represented.
