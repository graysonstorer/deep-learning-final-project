PART ONE

1.Introduction

Trade unions in the Soviet Union exist to pro mote the interests of their members,to improve their working and living conditions.Increasingly they involve workers in the management of pro duction and link better working output with im proved housing and communal facilities outside the workplace.

They consciously stimulate the development of the country's economy,involving workers on a massive scale in"socialist emulation"-the drive to improve production and work methods through application at plant,local and national levels of the most advanced skills and techniques.
