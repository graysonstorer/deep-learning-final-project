Pursuant to Article 1 of the Convention signed in Paris on 14th December 1960, and which came into force on 30th September 1961, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shall promote policies designed: – to achieve the highest sustainable economic growth and employment and a rising standard of living in member countries, while maintaining financial stability, and thus to contribute to the development of the world economy; – to contribute to sound economic expansion in member as well as non-member countries in the process of economic development; and – to contribute to the expansion of world trade on a multilateral, non-discriminatory basis in accordance with international obligations. The original member countries of the OECD are Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom and the United States. The following countries became members subsequently through accession at the dates indicated hereafter: Japan (28th April 1964), Finland (28th January 1969), Australia (7th June 1971), New Zealand (29th May 1973), Mexico (18th May 1994), the Czech Republic (21st December 1995), Hungary (7th May 1996), Poland (22nd November 1996), Korea (12th December 1996) and the Slovak Republic (14th December 2000). The Commission of the European Communities takes part in the work of the OECD (Article 13 of the OECD Convention). 

The Development Centre of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was established by decision of the OECD Council on 23rd October 1962 and comprises twenty member countries of the OECD: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Korea, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, as well as Chile since November 1998 and India since February 2001. The Commission of the European Communities also takes part in the Centre’s Governing Board. The purpose of the Centre is to bring together the knowledge and experience available in member countries of both economic development and the formulation and execution of general economic policies; to adapt such knowledge and experience to the actual needs of countries or regions in the process of development and to put the results at the disposal of the countries by appropriate means. The Centre is part of the “Development Cluster” at the OECD and enjoys scientific independence in the execution of its task. As part of the Cluster, together with the Centre for Co-operation with Non-Members, the Development Co-operation Directorate, and the Sahel and West Africa Club, the Development Centre can draw upon the experience and knowledge available in the OECD in the development field.

# Foreword 

This publication brings together two reference works by Angus Maddison: The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective , published in 2001 and The World Economy: Historical Statistics , which was released in 2003. The first volume provides a comprehensive view of the growth and levels of world population since the year 1000, when rich countries of today were poorer than Asia and Africa. It is a pioneering effort to quantify the economic performance of nations over the very long term, identifying forces which explain the success of the rich countries, and exploring the obstacles that hindered advance in less developed regions. In the second volume, Angus Maddison offers a rare insight into the history and political influence of national accounts and national accounting. Based on revised and updated population estimates for 1950-2003 and GDP and per capita GDP estimates for 1820 to 2001, he demonstrates that such statistical data can shed light on the analysis of economic phenomena like growth, market formation and income distribution. This approach is particularly interesting for developing countries often lacking the expertise or data to produce good national accounts. It also serves as a reminder for OECD countries that effective policy making depends on verifiable economic data. 

The World Economy is a monumental work of reference and a “must” for all scholars and students of economics and economic history, as well as a mine of fascinating facts for everyone else. An attractive feature of this new edition is the inclusion of Statlinks, which provide access to the underlying data in Excel® format. Further analysis and data compiled by Angus Maddison can be found at: www.ggdc.net/Maddison The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 4ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 5Table of Contents

# Foreword 

Shortly after my arrival at the OECD in 1996, I came upon the study by Angus Maddison “Monitoring the World Economy 1820–1992”. It is a fascinating and stimulating work providing a complete coverage of the world economy during the period in question. It brought together data of some 56 countries accounting for 93 per cent of the world output and 87 per cent of the world population and world exports. It never left my desk. Probably I was not alone in my appreciation of this quite extraordinary work, as I kept coming on references to it in the work of other authors. As we were nearing the end of the twentieth century, it seemed to me that this study could undergo some slight revisions to make it more attractive to general readership, and brought up to the close of the century and of the second millennium. I discussed the project with Professor Maddison and, to my delight, he agreed. From his enormous energy and intellectual capacity emerges a far greater work in depth and scope than anything I had imagined possible. This book covers the development of the entire world economy over the past two thousand years. The author takes a (quite literally) global view of world growth over that period, examining both changes over time and between different regions. The book has a wider ambit than any previous OECD publication or, indeed, than almost any other publication in the market worldwide. First, the scope of the analysis is breath–taking. Second, there must be few (if any) economic history books so wide in their reach, in terms of both geography and history. Third, although his approach is economic, it is not narrowly so and draws on many other subjects — history, geography, demography and more — on the path to its conclusions; this multidisciplinary sweep gives the book great value. Because of its value and its global reach, I am sure it will find a global readership, as an authoritative reference for academics, students, professionals and general readership. I predict it will find its place in homes, offices and libraries in every corner of the world, and for many years to come. It will undoubtedly be the foundation for further works of this kind during the millennium we have just entered. We should all be extremely grateful to Angus Maddison for having taken on this challenge with results which far exceed my original expectations. John Maynard Keynes wrote that the master economist should “examine the present in light of the past, for the purposes of the future”. Never before have we had such a rich resource at our disposal to pursue that objective.

# Preface 

Angus Maddison visited Nova University at Lisbon in 1986 and that is where we first met. I already knew of his work, since my late father, himself an economic historian, had mentioned its importance to me many years previously. It was therefore with some nostalgia that, as newly appointed President of the Development Centre, I found myself involved with Angus on a regular basis. The Development Centre’s association with Angus Maddison is a very long one. He was present at the birth of the Development Centre, influenced its evolution and the character of its research. In many ways, the Centre is indissociable from him. This is one reason why the writing of this extraordinary history of the world economy should have been entrusted to him. In addition, Angus is possibly the greatest living chiffrephile , as demonstrated by his earlier work for the Centre, most notably: The World Economy 1820–1992 and Chinese Economic Performance in the Long Run , both of which have become works of reference in quantitative economic history the world over. The Development Centre is preoccupied with the place of governance in the new world order. Our research effort is directed towards helping countries to find ways of reforming governance systems at every level of society. This is also a constant theme in this book. Throughout the thousand years under consideration, governance can be seen as a factor which either advantaged or disadvantaged growth. We therefore remain convinced that this is a vital issue confronting developing societies today. We are also persuaded that OECD countries have themselves a responsibility to implement good governance and to encourage it elsewhere.

# Introduction and Summary The Contours of World Development 

Over the past millennium, world population rose 22–fold. Per capita income increased 13–fold, world GDP nearly 300–fold. This contrasts sharply with the preceding millennium, when world population grew by only a sixth, and there was no advance in per capita income. From the year 1000 to 1820 the advance in per capita income was a slow crawl — the world average rose about 50 per cent. Most of the growth went to accommodate a fourfold increase in population. Since 1820, world development has been much more dynamic. Per capita income rose more than eightfold, population more than fivefold. Per capita income growth is not the only indicator of welfare. Over the long run, there has been a dramatic increase in life expectation. In the year 1000, the average infant could expect to live about 24 years. A third would die in the first year of life, hunger and epidemic disease would ravage the survivors. There was an almost imperceptible rise up to 1820, mainly in Western Europe. Most of the improvement has occurred since then. Now the average infant can expect to survive 66 years. The growth process was uneven in space as well as time. The rise in life expectation and income has been most rapid in Western Europe, North America, Australasia and Japan. By 1820, this group had forged ahead to an income level twice that in the rest of the world. By 1998, the gap was 7:1. Between the United States (the present world leader) and Africa (the poorest region) the gap is now 20:1. This gap is still widening. Divergence is dominant but not inexorable. In the past half century, resurgent Asian countries have demonstrated that an important degree of catch–up is feasible. Nevertheless world economic growth has slowed substantially since 1973, and the Asian advance has been offset by stagnation or retrogression elsewhere. 

The Purpose of this Study 

The purpose of this book is to quantify these long term changes in world income and population in a comprehensive way; identify the forces which explain the success of the rich countries; explore the obstacles which hindered advance in regions which lagged behind; scrutinise the interaction between the rich countries and the rest to assess the degree to which their backwardness may have been due to Western policy.

There is nothing new about long–term surveys of economic performance. Adam Smith had a very broad perspective in his pioneering work in 1776. Others have had an equally ambitious vision. There has been spectacular progress in recent years in historical demography 1. What is new in this study is systematic quantification of comparative economic performance. In the past, quantitative research in economic history has been heavily concentrated on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries when growth was fastest. To go back earlier involves use of weaker evidence, greater reliance on clues and conjecture. Nevertheless it is a meaningful, useful and necessary exercise because differences in the pace and pattern of change in major parts of the world economy have deep roots in the past. Quantification clarifies issues which qualitative analysis leaves fuzzy. It is more readily contestable and likely to be contested. It sharpens scholarly discussion, sparks off rival hypotheses, and contributes to the dynamics of the research process. It can only do this if the quantitative evidence and the nature of proxy procedures is described transparently so that the dissenting reader can augment or reject parts of the evidence or introduce alternative hypotheses. The analysis of Chapters 1, 2 and 3 is underpinned by six appendices which are intended to supply the necessary degree of transparency. 

Explaining Economic Performance 

Advances in population and income over the past millennium have been sustained by three interactive processes: 

a) Conquest or settlement of relatively empty areas which had fertile land, new biological resources, or a potential to accommodate transfers of population, crops and livestock; 

b) international trade and capital movements; 

c) technological and institutional innovation. 

a) Conquest and Settlement 

One important instance of this process was Chinese settlement of the relatively empty and swampy lands south of the Yangtse, and introduction of new quick–ripening strains of rice from Vietnam suitable for multicropping. This process occurred between the eighth and thirteenth centuries, during which population growth accelerated, per capita income rose by a third, and the distribution of population and economic activity were transformed. In the eighth century only a quarter of the Chinese population lived south of the Yangtse; in the thirteenth, more than threequarters. The new technology involved higher labour inputs, so productivity rose less than per capita income 2.An even more dramatic case was the European encounter with the Americas. The existence of this continent was unknown to Europeans before the 1492 voyage of Columbus 3. The discovery opened up an enormous area, for the most part thinly populated. Mexico and Peru were the most advanced and densely settled, but they were easily conquered and three quarters of their population was wiped out by diseases which the Europeans inadvertently introduced. The new continent offered crops unknown elsewhere — maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes, manioc, chilis, tomatoes, groundnuts, pineapples, cocoa and tobacco. These were introduced in Europe, Africa and Asia, and enhanced their production potential and capacity to sustain population growth. There was a reciprocal transfer to the Americas, which greatly augmented its potential. The new crops were wheat, rice, sugar cane, vines, salad greens, olives, bananas and coffee. The new animals for food were cattle, pigs, chickens, sheep and goats, as well as horses, oxen, asses and donkeys for transport. 21 Introduction and Summary 

The major initial attractions of the Americas were the rich silver resources of Mexico and Peru, and development of plantation agriculture with imports of slave labour from Africa. The neo–European economies of North America and the southern cone of Latin America developed later. The population of the Americas did not recover its 1500 level until the first half of the eighteenth century. The full potential of the Americas began to be realised in the nineteenth century with massive European immigration and the western movement of the production frontier made possible by railways. The present variation in economic performance within the Americas — between the United States, Latin America and the Caribbean — is partly due to variations in resource endowment, but there are institutional and societal echoes from the past. In North America and Brazil the relatively small indigenous population was marginalised or exterminated, in former Spanish colonies the indigenous population remained as an underclass, and in all the areas where slavery was important their descendants have also remained an underprivileged group. Quite apart from this, there were important differences in the colonial period between Iberian institutions and those of North America. These continued to have an impact on subsequent growth performance 4.

b) International Trade and Capital Movements 

International trade was important in the economic ascension of Western Europe, and much less significant in the history of Asia or Africa. Venice played a key role from 1000 to 1500 in opening up trade within Europe (to Flanders, France, Germany and the Balkans) and in the Mediterranean. It opened trade in Chinese products via the caravan routes to ports in the Black Sea. It traded in Indian and other Asian products via Syria and Alexandria. Trade was important in bringing high value spices and silks to Europe, but it also helped the transfer of technology from Asia, Egypt and Byzantium (silk and cotton textile production, glassblowing, cultivation of rice in Italy, cane sugar production and processing in the Venetian colonies of Crete and Cyprus). To a significant degree the maritime expansion of Venice depended on improved techniques of shipbuilding in its Arsenal, use of the compass and other improvements in navigation. Institutional innovations — the development of banking, accountancy, foreign exchange and credit markets, creation of a solvent system of public finance, creation of a competent diplomatic service were all instrumental in establishing Venice as the lead economy of that epoch. Venice played an important part in fostering the intellectual development of Western Europe. It created manuscript libraries and pioneered in book publishing. Its glass industry was the first to make spectacles on a large scale. It played a leading role in the Renaissance by making Greek works known in the West. The University of Padua was a major centre of European learning, with Galileo as one of its distinguished professors. Venetian contacts with Asia were eventually blocked by the fall of Byzantium, the rise of the Ottoman Empire, the collapse of the crusader states in the Levant and the Mameluke regime in Egypt. In the second half of the fifteenth century, a much more ambitious interaction between Europe and the rest of the world had started in Portugal. Portugal played the main role in opening up European trade, navigation and settlement in the Atlantic islands, in developing trade routes around Africa, into the Indian Ocean, to China and Japan. It became the major shipper of spices to Europe for the whole of the sixteenth century, usurping this role from Venice. Its navigators discovered Brazil. Its diplomacy was astute enough to persuade Spain to endorse its territorial claim there, and to let it have a monopoly of trade with the Moluccan spice islands and Indonesia. Although Spain had a bigger empire, its only significant base outside the Americas was the Philippines. Its two most famous navigators were Columbus who was a Genoese with Portuguese training, and Magellan who was Portuguese. The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 22 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

Portugal had major advantages in developing its overseas commerce and empire. There was a clear strategic benefit in being located on the South Atlantic coast of Europe near to the exit of the Mediterranean. Deep–sea fishermen provided an important part of the Portuguese food supply and developed an unrivalled knowledge of Atlantic winds, weather and tides. The value of these skills was greatly enhanced by crown sponsorship of Atlantic exploration, research on navigation, training of pilots, and documentation of maritime experience in the form of route maps with compass bearings (rutters) and cartography. Portuguese shipbuilders in Lisbon and Oporto adapted the design of their ships in the light of increasing knowledge of Atlantic sailing conditions. The biggest changes were in rigging. At first they concentrated on lateen sails, then added a mix of square sails and lateen for deeper penetration into the South Atlantic, with further changes for the much longer route round the Cape. Another element in Portuguese success was the ability to absorb “new Christians” — Jewish merchants and scholars who had played a significant role in Iberia during Muslim rule. They were driven out of Spain, but many took refuge and increased the size of the community in Portugal. They were required to undergo proforma conversion and were subject to a degree of persecution, but they provided important skills in developing Portuguese business interests in Africa, Brazil and Asia, in scientific development, as intermediaries in trade with the Muslim world and in attracting Genoese and Catalan capital to Portuguese business ventures. Portugal was responsible for transferring cane sugar production and processing technology into the Atlantic islands of Madeira and Sâo Tomé, and later to Brazil. It inaugurated the slave trade to provide a labour force for the industry in the New World. It carried about half of the slaves who were shipped to the Americas from Africa between 1500 and 1870. In the fifteenth century, sugar was a very rare and expensive commodity in Europe; by the end of the eighteenth century it was an item of popular consumption, having grown much more in volume than trade in any other tropical product. At the time Portugal was pioneering these worldwide linkages, trade relations between different parts of northern Europe were intensified by the phenomenal development of Dutch maritime activity. In 1570, the carrying capacity of Dutch merchant shipping was about the same as the combined fleets of England, France and Germany. Per head of population it was 25 times as big as in these three northern countries. Development of shipping and shipbuilding, the transformation of Dutch agriculture into horticulture, the creation of a large canal network, use of power derived from windmills and peat made the Netherlands the most dynamic European economy from 1400 to the middle of the seventeenth century. It pushed international specialisation much further than any other country. Shipping and commercial services provided a large part of its income. It imported cereals and live cattle, exported herring and dairy products. In 1700 only 40 per cent of the labour force were in agriculture. Until 1580 the Netherlands was part of a bigger political entity. It included Flanders and Brabant — the most prosperous industrial area in Europe and a centre for banking, finance and international commerce which was a northern counterpart to Venice. The whole area was under Burgundian control until the late fifteenth century, then fell into the hands of the Habsburgs who were also rulers of Spain. The Dutch revolted against their predatory empire because of its excessive fiscal demands, political and religious repression. They created a modern nation state, which protected property rights of merchants and entrepreneurs, promoted secular education and practised religious tolerance. Most of the financial and entrepreneurial elite and many of the most skilled artisans of Flanders and Brabant emigrated to the new republic. The Dutch blockaded the river Scheldt and the port of Antwerp for more than 200 years, and destroyed the Iberian monopoly of trade with Africa, Asia and the Americas. Dutch experience from 1580 to the end of the Napoleonic wars provides a dramatic demonstration of the way in which Western Europe interacted with the world economy in that epoch. 23 Introduction and Summary 

The initial economic success of the Dutch Republic, and its maritime and commercial supremacy, depended to a substantial extent on success in war and beggar–your–neighbour commercial policy in competition with Portugal and Spain. By the eighteenth century it had lost this supremacy, because two new rivals, England and France, had greatly increased their maritime strength, and used the same techniques to push the Dutch out of the markets they sought to dominate. The volume of Dutch foreign trade dropped 20 per cent from 1720 to 1820. During this period, UK exports rose more than sevenfold in volume, and French by two and threequarters. From 1700 to 1820, Dutch per capita income fell by a sixth, British rose by half and French by a quarter. Britain had faster growth in per capita income from the 1680s to 1820 than any other European country. This was due to improvement of its banking, financial and fiscal institutions and agriculture on lines which the Dutch had pioneered, and to a surge in industrial productivity at the end of the period. It also derived great benefits from its rise to commercial hegemony by adroit use of a beggar– your–neighbour strategy. Sixty years of armed conflict and the restrictive Navigation Acts pushed competitors out of the markets it sought to monopolise. It took over the leading role in shipping slaves from Africa to the Caribbean and created an overseas empire with a population of about 100 million by 1820. Other European powers were losers in the British struggle for supremacy. By the end of the Napoleonic wars, the Dutch had lost all their Asian territories except Indonesia. The French were reduced to a token colonial presence in Asia, and lost their major asset in the Caribbean. Shortly after the war, Brazil established its independence from Portugal. Spain lost its huge colonial empire in Latin America, retaining only Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Britain took over what the French and Dutch had lost in Asia and Africa, extended its control over India, and established a privileged commercial presence in Latin America. Other losers included the former rulers of India, whose power and income were usurped in substantial part by the servants of the British East India Company. Under their rule, from 1757 to 1857, Indian per capita income fell, but British gains were substantial. Between 1820 and 1913, British per capita income grew faster than at any time in the past — three times as fast as in 1700–1820. The basic reason for improved performance was the acceleration of technical progress, accompanied by rapid growth of the physical capital stock and improvement in the education and skills of the labour force, but changes in commercial policy also made a substantial contribution. In 1846 protective duties on agricultural imports were removed and in 1849 the Navigation Acts were terminated. By 1860, all trade and tariff restrictions had been removed unilaterally. In 1860 there were reciprocal treaties for freer trade with France and other European countries. These had most–favoured nation clauses which meant that bilateral liberalisation applied equally to all countries. Free trade was imposed in India and other British colonies, and the same was true in Britain’s informal empire. China, Persia, Thailand and the Ottoman Empire were not colonies, but were obliged to maintain low tariffs by treaties which reduced their sovereignty in commercial matters, and granted extraterritorial rights to foreigners. This regime of free trade imperialism favoured British exports, but was less damaging to the interests of the colonies than in the eighteenth century, when Jamaica could only trade with Britain and its colonies, Guadeloupe only with France. The British policy of free trade and its willingness to import a large part of its food had positive effects on the world economy. They reinforced and diffused the impact of technical progress. The favourable impact was biggest in North America, the southern cone of Latin America and Australasia which had rich natural resources and received a substantial inflow of capital, but there was also some positive effect in India which was the biggest and poorest part of the Empire. Innovations in communications played a major part in linking national capital markets and facilitating international capital movements. The United Kingdom already had an important role in international finance, thanks to the soundness of its public credit and monetary system, the size of its The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 24 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

capital market and public debt, and the maintenance of a gold standard. The existence of the empire created a system of property rights which appeared to be as securely protected as those available to investors in British securities. It was a wealthy country operating close to the frontiers of technology, so its rentiers were attracted to foreign investment even when the extra margin of profit was small. From the 1870s onward, there was a massive outflow of British capital for overseas investment. The United Kingdom directed half its savings abroad. French, German and Dutch investment was also substantial. The old liberal order was shattered by two world wars and the collapse of capital flows, migration and trade in the beggar–your–neighbour years of the 1930s. Between 1913 and 1950, the world economy grew much more slowly than in 1870–1913, world trade grew much less than world income, and the degree of inequality between regions increased substantially, the setback being biggest in Asia. By 1950 colonialism was in an advanced state of disintegration. With one or two exceptions, the exit from empire was more or less complete by the 1960s. The British imperial order was finished, as were those of Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Japan. In the West, the United States had emerged as the hegemonial power competing with the Soviet bloc for leverage in the newly independent countries of Asia and Africa. The world economy grew very much faster from 1950 to 1973 than it had ever done before. It was a golden age of unparalleled prosperity. World per capita GDP rose nearly 3 per cent a year (a rate which implies a doubling every 25 years). World GDP rose by nearly 5 per cent a year and world trade by nearly 8 per cent a year. This dynamism affected all regions. The acceleration was greatest in Europe and Asia. There was also a degree of convergence between regions, though a good part of this was a narrowing of the gap between the United States and the other advanced capitalist countries (Western Europe and Japan). There were several reasons for unusually favourable performance in the golden age. In the first place, the advanced capitalist countries created a new kind of liberal international order with explicit and rational codes of behaviour, and institutions for co–operation (OEEC, OECD, IMF, World Bank and the GATT) which had not existed before. There was a very serious East–West split from 1948 onwards, but the split reinforced the harmony of interest between capitalist economies, so the beggar– your–neighbour behaviour of pre–war years did not recur. The United States provided a substantial flow of aid for Europe when it was most needed, fostering procedures for articulate co–operation and liberal trading policies. Until the 1970s it also provided the world with a strong anchor for international monetary stability. North–South relations were transformed from the colonial tutelage of pre–war years to a situation where more emphasis was placed on action to stimulate development. The huge expansion of trade in the advanced capitalist economies transmitted a dynamic influence throughout the world economy. The second new element of strength was the character of domestic policies which were self– consciously devoted to promotion of high levels of demand and employment in the advanced countries. Growth was not only faster than ever before, but the business cycle virtually disappeared. Investment rose to unprecedented levels and expectations became euphoric. Until the 1970s, there was also much milder inflationary pressure than could have been expected in conditions of secular boom. The third element in this virtuous circle situation was the potential for growth on the supply side. Throughout Europe and Asia there was still substantial scope for “normal” elements of “recovery” from the years of depression and war. Additionally and more importantly, was the continued acceleration of technical progress in the lead country. Furthermore, the United States played a diffusionist role in the golden age in sharp contrast to its role in the interwar years. Since the golden age, the world picture has changed a great deal. Per capita growth has been less than half as fast. There has been much greater divergence in the performance of different regions. In Western Europe and Japan, per capita growth fell well below that in the golden age, but was appreciably 25 Introduction and Summary 

better than in 1870–1913. In the countries of “resurgent Asia”, which have half the world’s population, the success was quite extraordinary. Their per capita growth was faster after 1973 than in the golden age, and more than ten times as fast as in the old liberal order. If the world consisted only of these two groups, the pattern of world development could be interpreted as a clear demonstration of the possibilities for convergence. By success in mobilising and allocating resources efficiently and improving their human and physical capital to assimilate and adapt appropriate technology, the countries of resurgent Asia achieved significant catch–up on the advanced capitalist group. However, there is another group (168 countries, with about a third of the world’s population) where the deterioration in performance since the golden age has been alarming. In Africa there has been no advance in per capita income in the past quarter century. In Eastern Europe and the former USSR, average per capita income in 1998 was about threequarters of that in 1973. In Latin America and in many Asian countries, income gains have been a fraction of what they were in the golden age. The economies of this heterogeneous group of “faltering economies” have been falling behind instead of catching up. Most of them have not been able to adapt successfully to an international economic order which has changed considerably from that in the golden age. The way in which postwar order now operates is analysed in detail in Chapter 3. The structure of the analysis is based on Table 3–5 which summarises the comparative performance of the major regions. 

c) Technological and Institutional Innovation 

From the year 1000 to 1820, advances in technology were much slower than they have been since, but they were nevertheless a significant component of the growth process. Without improvements in agriculture, the increase in world population could not have been sustained. Without improvements in maritime technology and commercial institutions the opening up of the world economy could not have been achieved. Technical advance in important areas was dependent on fundamental improvements in scientific method, experimental testing, systematic accumulation and publication of new knowledge. The long centuries of effort provided intellectual and institutional foundations for the much more rapid advances achieved in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This process of cumulative advance is clearly demonstrated in the history of maritime technology and navigation. In the year 1000, European ships and navigation were no better than in the Roman Empire. The advance started when Venice created its public shipyard, the Arsenal, in 1104 to build its oared galleys and improve ship design. The introduction of the compass and the sandglass for measuring time at sea helped to double the productivity of ships. They could navigate in bad weather and make two return journeys a year from Venice to Alexandria instead of one. The Portuguese preparations for the passage to India were a major research project involving years of experimentation in shipping technology, improvement of navigational instruments and charts, applied astronomy, developing knowledge of winds, currents and alternative routes. The Dutch created a new type of factory ship for processing the herring catch at sea. They developed mass production of a cheap general purpose cargo vessel (the fluyt). The British government financed and encouraged research into astronomy, terrestrial magnetism, production of the first reliable maritime chronometer and nautical almanacs. They also demonstrated the efficacy of sauerkraut and citrus juice in preventing scurvy. By the end of the eighteenth century ships could carry ten times the cargo of a fourteenth century Venetian galley, with a much smaller crew. The safety of long distance sea travel was also greatly improved. In their first voyages to Asia, da Gama and Cabral lost half their crew and more than half of their ships. Magellan lost more than 90 per cent of his crew on the first circumnavigation of the globe. Cook’s successful circumnavigation 240 years later approximated modern standards of maritime safety. The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 26 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

Until the fifteenth century, European progress in many fields was dependent on transfers of technology from Asia or the Arab world. In 1405–33, Chinese superiority in shipping technology was evident in seven major expeditions to the “Western Oceans” (see Table 2–11). Chinese ships were much bigger than those of the Portuguese, more seaworthy and more comfortable, with watertight compartments, many more cabins, and a capacity to navigate over large distances to Africa. Thereafter, China turned its back on the world economy, and its maritime technology decayed. By the end of the seventeenth century, the technological leadership of Europe in shipping and armaments was apparent. There had also been important institutional advances. Banking, credit, foreign exchange markets, financial and fiscal management, accountancy, insurance and corporate governance (by the Dutch and British East India Companies) were more sophisticated than those in Asia, and were essential components of European success in opening up the world economy. Within Western Europe the diffusion of technology was fairly rapid, and the technological distance between nations was not particularly wide in spite of the frequency of wars. Links were fostered by the growth of humanist scholarship, the creation of universities and the invention of printing. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, there was a revolutionary change in the quality of western science with close interaction of savants and scientists such as Copernicus, Erasmus, Bacon, Galileo, Hobbes, Descartes, Petty, Leibnitz, Huyghens, Halley and Newton. Many of them were in close contact with colleagues in other countries, or spent years abroad. This type of co–operation was institutionalised by the creation of scientific academies which encouraged discussion and research, and published their proceedings. Much of this work had practical relevance, and many of the leading figures were concerned with matters of public policy. Diffusion of these advances outside Europe was relatively limited. There were Jesuit scholars in Peking for nearly two centuries, some of them like Ricci, Schall and Verbiest had intimate contact with ruling circles, but there was little curiosity amongst the Chinese elite about intellectual and scientific development in the West. Japanese exposure to western knowledge was more limited than Chinese, but its impact went deeper. The Portuguese and the Jesuits were in Japan for nearly a century, and there was considerable interest in European ships, maps, navigation and guns. After the Portuguese were expelled the only contact Japan had with western learning was with those Dutch East India Company officials who were scientists (Kaempfer, Thunberg and von Siebold). Although these contacts were limited, they helped destroy Japanese respect for “things Chinese” and accentuate their curiosity about “things Western” (see Appendix B). The East India Company officers who controlled India from 1757 to 1857 had a strong streak of Benthamite radicalism, and a strong urge to modify Indian legal and property institutions. After the Indian Mutiny of 1857 and establishment of direct imperial control, these radical westernising ambitions were dropped. In Indonesia, there were somewhat similar ambitions in the period of British administration during the Napoleonic wars, but Westernisation was abandoned after the Diponogoro revolt in the 1830s. The only effective overseas transmission of European technology and science by the end of the eighteenth century was to the 13 British colonies in North America. In 1776 they had nine universities for 2.5 million people and an intellectual elite (e.g. Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson) fully familiar with the activities of their European contemporaries. In the Spanish colonies, Brazil and the Caribbean there were more than 17 million people, but only two universities (in Mexico City and Guadalajara) which concentrated on theology and law. 27 Introduction and Summary 

The reasons for the accelerated growth of technical progress since 1820 are analysed in considerable detail in my earlier study, Monitoring the World Economy (1995), particularly in Chapter 2 and pp. 71–3, and are not treated at any length in this volume. However, it is clear that technical progress has slowed down. It was a good deal faster from 1913 to 1973 than it has been since. The slowdown in the past quarter century is one of the reasons for the deceleration of world economic growth. “New economy” pundits find the notion of decelerating technical progress unacceptable and cite anecdotal or microeconomic evidence to argue otherwise. However, the impact of their technological revolution has not been apparent in the macroeconomic statistics until very recently, and I do not share their euphoric expectations 5.The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 28 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

## Notes 

1. Wrigley and Schofield (1981) and Wrigley and Associates (1997) used techniques of family reconstitution and inverse projection to exploit church records of births, deaths and marriages. As a result, we now have annual estimates of English population and demographic characteristics since 1541. Bagnall and Frier (1994) used remnants of Roman censuses to reconstruct the demography and economy of third century Egypt. Thanks to the work of de Vries (1984) for Europe and Rozman (1973) for Asia one can measure the proportionate importance of urbanisation for long periods in the past. The Chinese bureaucracy kept population registers which go back more than 2 000 years. These bureaucratic records were designed to assess taxable capacity, and include information on cultivated area and crop production, which was used by Perkins (1969) to assess long run movements in Chinese GDP per capita. The work of Perkins encouraged me to write Chinese Economic Performance in the Long Run (OECD Development Centre, 1998) which has the same temporal perspective as the present study. 2. See Maddison (1998 a), pp. 24–33 for an analysis of the historical development of Chinese agriculture; see Boserup (1965) for a brilliant refutation of the simplistic Malthusian view that population pressure on a fixed stock of natural resources will inevitably produce diminishing returns. She shows how “traditional” Asian agriculture accommodated population pressure by a whole series of changes of technical practice. Intensity of land use progressed from hunter–gatherer activities, to forest fallow, settled farming with improved tools, from dry farming and fallowing to irrigation and multi–cropping. In this process there was probably a significant drop in labour productivity before modern fertilisers and machinery came on the scene. 3. See Morison (1971) on the Norwegian movement from Iceland to Greenland and Leif Ericsson’s trip in 1001 via Baffin island, Belle Isle and the Labrador sea to the northern tip of Newfoundland where there was a very brief and long forgotten settlement at l’Anse aux Meadows. 4. Adam Smith The Wealth of Nations, 1776, book IV, Chapter VII, Part II contains a prescient assessment of these institutional differences and their implications for subsequent development. Engrossment of land which hindered its development and transfer, the heavy burden taxes to support the pomp of civil and ecclesiastical government, and official control of markets were the shortcomings in the Spanish colonies which he emphasised. See Chapter 2 of this study for my assessment of the Portuguese influence on Brazil, and the difference between the colonial heritage in Mexico and the United States. 5.

# The Contours of World Development 

World economic performance was very much better in the second millennium of our era than in the first. Between 1000 and 1998 population rose 22–fold and per capita income 13–fold. In the previous millennium, population rose by a sixth and per capita GDP fell slightly. The second millennium comprised two distinct epochs. From 1000 to 1820 the upward movement in per capita income was a slow crawl — for the world as a whole the rise was about 50 per cent. Growth was largely “extensive” in character. Most of it went to accommodate a fourfold increase in population. Since 1820, world development has been much more dynamic, and more “intensive”. Per capita income rose faster than population; by 1998 it was 8.5 times as high as in 1820; population rose 5.6–fold. There was a wide disparity in the performance of different regions in both epochs. The most dynamic was Group A: Western Europe, Western Offshoots (the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand) and Japan. In 1000–1820, their average per capita income grew nearly four times as fast as the average for the rest of the world. The differential continued between 1820 and 1998 when per capita income of the first group rose 19–fold and 5.4–fold for the second. There are much wider income gaps today than at any other time in the past. Two thousand years ago the average level for Groups A and B was similar. In the year 1000 the average for Group A was lower as a result of the economic collapse after the fall of the Roman Empire. By 1820, Group A had forged ahead to a level about twice that in the rest of the world. In 1998 the gap was almost 7:1. Between the Western Offshoots and Africa (the richest and poorest regions) it is 19 to one. Economic performance since 1820 within Group B has not been as closely clustered as in Group A. Per capita income has grown faster in Latin America than Eastern Europe and Asia, and nearly twice as fast as in Africa. Nevertheless, from a Western standpoint, performance in all these regions has been disappointing. There have been big changes in the weight of different regions. In the year 1000, Asia (except Japan) produced more than two thirds of world GDP, Western Europe less than 9 per cent. In 1820 the proportions were 56 and 24 per cent respectively. In 1998, the Asian share was about 30 per cent compared with 46 per cent for Western Europe and Western Offshoots combined.

IT HE N ATURE AND W ELFARE I MPLICATIONS OF P OPULATION C HANGE 

The acceleration of population growth over the past millennium could have come from increased fertility or reduced mortality. The evidence (Table 1–4) suggests that a slow and irregular decline in mortality was the predominant cause before 1820. Since 1820 the decline in mortality has been much sharper, and has clearly been the predominant influence. In fact fertility has declined substantially since 1820 (see Table 1–5a). Increases in life expectation are an important manifestation of improvement in human welfare. They are not captured by our measure of GDP, but there has been significant congruence, over time and between regions, in the patterns of improvement in per capita income and life expectation.

Saito (1997), p. 143 average for both sexes of his high infant mortality estimate. The first two estimates are derived from temple registers (kakocho), the third from population registers (shumon aratame cho). There is a much greater scarcity of information on infant mortality in Japanese sources than in the European records. Children were not covered in the registers. Temple records provide material on deaths by age but not population. There is a further problem that the Japanese system of counting age was different from that in the West and the degree of ambiguity was large for infants. Japanese children were presumed to be 1 year old at birth and two years old on the following New Year's day. A Japanese child could therefore be anywhere between 2 days and 1 year old when it became 2 years old in the Japanese system (see Saito, 1997). Estimates of infant mortality are therefore hypothetical or inferential. Saito used one of the probability models which Coale and Demeny (1983) constructed to fill gaps in information on deaths by age. Saito (1997), p. 136 shows other estimates with much higher life expectation than the three I show. In my view these are not plausible and either show or infer improbably low infant mortality. Kalland and Pederson (1984) pp. 54 and 61 show life expectation averaging 44 years for 1700–1824 in Kanezaki and an infant mortality rate of less than 100. Smith (1977) pp. 57 and 162 shows a life expectation of 43.2 for 1717–1830 in Nakahara, and a range of alternative infant mortality options which Saito averages at 145. Hanley and Yamamura (1977), p. 222 show a life expectation of 45 for Nishikata 1782–96 and 43 for Fujito 1800–35, without showing infant mortality.

In the year 1000, average life expectation at the world level was probably about 24 years — no better than at the beginning of our era. By 1820, it rose to about 26 years (see Table 1–5b). The rise was biggest — from 24 to 36 years — in Group A, and since then has risen to 78 years. The increase was ten times as fast from 1820 as in the previous eight centuries. In Group B countries, our very crude estimate suggests that there was no improvement between 1000 and 1820. By 1998 it had grown dramatically to an average of 64 years. Table 1–5a.

Life expectation in 1999 in the Group A countries was fairly closely clustered. In Group B, there was not much difference between Russia, Latin America and Asia, with an average of 67 years. But in Africa, life expectation was significantly lower at 52 years. Although the pattern of improvement in life expectation and per capita income has been similar, the present interregional dispersions are much bigger for income. In 1999 the gap in life expectation between the lead country, Japan, with 81 years and Africa with 52 years was distressingly wide. But it was much smaller than the 15:1 spread in per capita income level between Japan and Africa. Table 1–5b. Average Life Expectation for Groups A and B, 1000–1999

West European Experience 

Table 1–6 presents the evidence on long run growth of West European population. The pace of change has been very uneven. There were major disasters in the sixth and fourteenth centuries and a substantial setback in several countries in the seventeenth century. Until the nineteenth century population growth was repeatedly interrupted by crises of varying frequency and severity. These were of three main types: hunger crises due to harvest failure, waves of infectious disease, or war. These different types of causality were of course interactive in varying degree. As European countries operated much nearer to subsistence levels in the past than is now the case, with poor transport and storage facilities, harvest failures could create big spikes in mortality. They also affected birth rates, because dietary deficiencies caused amenorrhea or led young couples to postpone marriage. A major instance of this type of crisis was the potato famine which doubled the normal death rate in Ireland over the six years 1846–51. “Excess” deaths were nearly one million or about 12 per cent of the 1845 population (see Ó Gráda, 1988).

Recurrent episodes of infectious disease caused major surges in mortality. The worst was bubonic plague which wiped out a third of the European population in the sixth century and again in the fourteenth. The second plague lingered for centuries, finally dying out in England in 1665 and in France in 1720–21. John Graunt, the first scientific demographer, chronicled its impact in London for the years 1592, 1603, 1625, 1630, 1636, and 1665, the worst year, when a total of 97 000 burials were recorded (about 16 per cent of the population). Biraben (1972) estimated a total of 94 000 plague deaths in Provence in 1720–1 (about 32 per cent of the population) due to the arrival of a ship in Marseilles which brought the disease from Syria. The impact of this plague was limited by strict control of movement in and out of the region. The plague disappeared, but many other lethal diseases remained — cholera, diphtheria, dysentery, influenza, measles, smallpox, tuberculosis, typhus and typhoid. Their incidence receded temporarily after epidemics had wiped out the least resistant. In some cases, like the plague, repeated exposure seems to have generated resistance or immunity in the long term. In other cases, the bacterial and viral organisms responsible for infection may have changed. The pattern and duration of acquired immunities varied for reasons not fully understood, but the impact of epidemic disease declined sharply in Western Europe in the late nineteenth and in the twentieth century. However deaths surged again in the global influenza epidemic of 1918–19. The new threat from Aids seems to have been contained in Group A countries. Until the twentieth century, a major countervailing force in the process of mortality reduction was increased urbanisation. Although city dwellers had higher incomes and better organised food markets than rural areas, their mortality rates were distinctly higher. John Graunt discovered this for London in the seventeenth century where burials were substantially higher than christenings. Mortality rates were a good deal higher in London than in small towns like Romsey, Tiverton and Cranbrook whose experience he also investigated. London’s expansion was due to high net immigration, but the big city was a reservoir of infection, with poor sanitation, most lethal in its impact on infants and recent immigrants. Wrigley et al. 

(1997), p. 218, note that in the early eighteenth century London’s infant mortality rate was about twice as high as for the country as a whole. Hayami (1986 a) notes the same phenomenon in Japan, citing evidence for the capital city Edo for 1840–68. In the course of the twentieth century this differential has disappeared (see Preston and van der Walle, 1978, for the decline in the differential in nineteenth century France). Over the long run, in the centuries before 1820, there was a slow increase in agricultural productivity and improvements in food availability. Hunger crises became less frequent or severe. Increased resistance to disease was also helped by rising living standards, substitution of wine, beer and tea for contaminated water, improvements in clothing and bedding. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, better sanitation and public health facilities, improvements in medical knowledge and facilities greatly reduced the incidence of premature death by infectious disease (see Fogel, 1986, for a causal analysis of mortality decline). The most striking feature has been the reduction in infant mortality. Around 1820, it was probably between 150–200 per 1 000 population in Western Europe and about 200 in Japan. In the 1990s, it was about seven in Western Europe and four per 1 000 in Japan. The increase in life expectation for the elderly in Western Europe, the Western Offshoots and Japan since 1950 involved a big rise in health expenditure. Earlier decreases in mortality in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries were much cheaper to obtain. Figure 1–2 provides a fairly representative picture of European mortality and fertility experience since 1736 when such records first became available in Sweden. Vallin (1991) presents similar charts for English, French, Finnish and Norwegian mortality back to 1720. Until the latter half of the nineteenth century, the pattern in all these countries was more irregular than it has been since because crisis mortality has been greatly mitigated. Figure I–2 also shows the demographic transition which started in the mid– nineteenth century throughout most of Western Europe. Birth rates have fallen more than death rates. In 1998, they were about a third of their 1820 level. As a consequence population growth is much slower and demographic structure has changed dramatically. In England, which is fairly typical of West European experience, nearly 39 per cent of 1821 population were below 15 years of age and less than 5 per cent were 65 or over. In 1998, 19 per cent were below 15 and nearly 16 per cent 65 or over. The proportion aged 15–64 rose from 60 to 65 per cent. 37 The Contours of World Development http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/301542223888

The Americas and Australasia 

The pattern of mortality, migration and population growth in the Americas and Australia was changed drastically by the encounter with Western Europe. The relatively densely populated agrarian civilisations of Mexico and Peru were quickly destroyed by the sixteenth century Spanish conquest mainly because of the inadvertent introduction of European diseases (smallpox, measles, influenza and typhus). Shortly thereafter the traffic in slaves introduced yellow fever and malaria. The consequences were devastating for the indigenous population. At least threequarters of them perished (see Appendix B). In Latin America as a whole, mortality was about twice as big proportionately as Europe’s loss from the Black Death. In parts of the Americas where the population was mainly hunter–gatherers and less densely settled (e.g. Brazil, and the areas that subsequently became Canada and the United States), the impact of disease mortality was somewhat smaller. Western contact with Australia and other Pacific islands occurred towards the end of the eighteenth century. The impact of disease on mortality was similar to that in the Americas, and there was a more deliberate policy of exterminating the native population than in Spanish America (see Butlin, 1983 and 1993). Although the initial impact of conquest and colonisation was massively destructive for the indigenous population, the long term economic potential of the Americas was greatly enhanced. Capacity to support a bigger population was augmented by the introduction of new crops and animals (see Crosby, 1972). The new crops were wheat, rice, sugar cane, vines, salad greens, olives, bananas and coffee. The new animals for food were cattle, pigs, chickens, sheep and goats. The introduction of transport and traction animals — horses, oxen, asses and donkeys — along with wheeled vehicles and ploughs (which replaced digging sticks) were another major addition to productive capacity. There was also a reciprocal transfer of New World crops to Europe, Asia and Africa — maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes, manioc, chilis, tomatoes, groundnuts, pineapples, cocoa and tobacco — which enhanced the world’s production potential and capacity to sustain population growth. New economic horizons and acquisition of vast territories led to a large scale transfer of population from Europe and Africa. Between 1500 and 1870 almost nine and a half million African slaves were shipped to work in plantation agriculture (sugar, tobacco, coffee and cotton) in Brazil, the Caribbean and the southern United States. The migration of Spanish and Portuguese settlers to Latin America in the colonial period (before 1820) was smaller than the movement of slaves. Portuguese emigration was probably about half a million (Marcilio, 1984), and Spanish less than a million (Sanchez–Albornoz, 1984). Galenson (1996) estimates British migration to the Caribbean to have been about a quarter of a million from 1630 to 1780. If we include French and Dutch migration, the net white migration to Latin America probably totalled two million before 1820, compared with imports of 7.5 million slaves. However the life expectation of slaves was a good deal lower. Merrick and Graham (1979, pp. 56–7) estimate 18 years for male slaves in Brazil in 1872, compared with 27 years for the total population. Fertility of slaves was also lower because of the precarious nature of their opportunities for family life. The proportion of females in the white immigrant population was low. Threequarters or more consisted of adult males. Their fertility was quite high because of informal unions with the indigenous and black population. As a result there was a much greater ethnic mix in Latin America than in North America. Since 1820, Latin American population has grown faster than that of Western Europe. The main reason has been higher birth rates, as the decline in mortality came later and has been smaller. Migration from Europe to Latin America accounted for a substantial part of the differential before 1913, but has been less important since then. In the area of the United States and Canada, European settlement started in the seventeenth century, and expanded rapidly in the eighteenth, when there was also a large import of slaves. The indigenous population was killed off or pushed out of the areas of European settlement. In 1700, The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 40 

threequarters of the population had been indigenous, by 1820 they were only 3 per cent (see Table B–15). In the South, there was a heavy concentration on plantation agriculture, with slaves as the main component of the labour force. In the North, white settlers predominated and were mainly occupied on family farms. White life expectation in North America was similar to that in Western Europe. It was lower for slaves, but the differential was smaller than in Brazil. Merrick and Graham (1979, p. 57) show 35.5 years for slaves in the 1850s and 40.4 for the US population as a whole. Fertility was high. In the United States, the birth rate was 5.5 per 100 population in 1820, in Canada (Quebec) 5.7. This was much higher than the United Kingdom (4.0) or France (3.2). Since 1820 the US population has grown a good deal faster than that of Western Europe. The death rate has been similar. The birth rate has remained higher but has declined proportionately as much as in Western Europe. Immigration to the United States has continued at a high level. Most of the immigrants came from Europe before the 1960s, so migration explains a good deal of the US/ European growth differential. 

Japan 

From the seventh to the mid–nineteenth century, Japan tried to model its economy, society and institutions on those of China, but its demographic experience was very different: 

a) over the long run, the major check to Japanese population expansion came from famines and hunger crises. Disease and war were much less important than in China (and Europe); 

b) by the second half of the eighteenth century, and perhaps earlier, Japanese life expectation was similar to that in Western Europe, and much higher than in China. 

Comparative Incidence of Hunger, Disease and War 

Macfarlane (1997) provides a comparative survey of the long run forces affecting mortality in England and Japan; Jannetta (1986) a detailed study of Japanese experience with epidemic disease, and Saito (1996) an assessment of the comparative incidence of famine and disease in Japan over the long term. The major point which emerges from their work is that Japan was not affected by bubonic plague. The main reason was Japan’s isolation. Two hundred kilometres of stormy seas separated it from Korea. The nearest point in China was 750 kilometres away. This sea barrier, and official policy, imposed an effective cordon sanitaire . Travel into and out of Japan was very restricted. Foreigners trading with Japan were more or less permanently quarantined in a small area near Nagasaki. There was no import of grain or other products likely to introduce pests. The two Mongol attempts to invade Japan in 1274 and 1281 were unsuccessful. If they had succeeded Japan’s demographic history (and much else) would have been very different. Freedom from the plague was the main reason why Japanese population growth was faster than that of Europe and China in the first millennium and a half of our era. Smallpox was the most significant cause of Japanese epidemics. Mortality from other diseases — cholera, dysentery, malaria, measles, tuberculosis and typhoid fever was milder than in Europe, and epidemic typhus was absent. This situation was mainly due to hygienic habits, and very limited contact with animals. Japanese had an abundant supply of mountain streams and hot springs, and the Shinto emphasis on physical purity led to daily bathing at home or in bathhouses. Japanese houses were austere but kept spotlessly clean and well ventilated. Shoes were left at the entry, there was 41 The Contours of World Development 

virtually no furniture or hangings except mosquito nets. Most water consumption was in the form of tea made with boiling water. The Japanese diet consisted of rice, fish, soyabeans, a considerable variety of vegetables, bamboo shoots and giant radishes. Buddhist tradition meant that Japanese ate virtually no meat. They had no cows, pigs, sheep, goats or animal dung. Although human wastes were used for manure, the few foreigners who visited Japan were greatly impressed by the immaculate privies, and the sanitary treatment of sewage. In 1853, foreigners were able to force an entry into Japan and greatly increased the range of foreign contacts. This resulted very quickly in a major cholera epidemic in 1858–60, and much greater exposure to influenza, tuberculosis, typhoid, typhus and diphtheria (see Saito, 1996 and Honda, 1997). As a consequence the Japanese death rate rose significantly until the 1890s (see Ishii, 1937, pp. 124–5). Saito (1996) has collated the historical records of famine and crop failure from the eighth to the twentieth century for Japan. Although it is not possible to measure the intensity of these hunger crises one can get an idea of changes in their frequency. From the eighth to the tenth centuries, there was one every three years, in the eleventh to fifteenth centuries one every five years, in the sixteenth to eighteenth one every four years, in the nineteenth every nine years, and none in the twentieth century. It is not possible to compare the importance of Japanese hunger crises with those in China or Europe. However, the nature of the Japanese and European diets was very different. Europeans had substantial consumption of meat, milk and other animal products which were absent in Japan. They had sufficient cereal production to make large quantities of ale and beer which the Japanese did not have. Land scarcity was much greater in Japan, and Japanese had to work much more intensively than Europeans. The combination of greater austerity and greater physical strain may well have made Japanese more vulnerable to hunger crises than Europeans, but the susceptibility was probably similar to that of Chinese. A third major check to population comes from war. Here Japanese experience was very mild compared with China, and probably milder than in Western Europe. China suffered major losses from the Mongol invasion of North China in 1234. The Mongols razed many cities, inflicted great damage on agriculture, enserfed or enslaved part of the rural population and displaced them by pastoralising cropland to make way for horses. Their later assault on South China in 1279 was much less destructive, but Mongol horsemen brought bubonic plague in 1353. Total population loss from the encounter with the Mongols was around 30 million. The transition from the Mongol to the Ming dynasty did not involve substantial mortality. The next big disaster was the replacement of the Ming by the Manchus. The Manchu takeover was rapid in North China in 1644, but the struggle with Ming loyalists in the South lasted till 1683. The savagery of war, combined with smallpox and famine, reduced population by more than 20 million. There was also significant migration from mainland China. In the struggle with Koxinga who operated from Taiwan, the Manchus carried out a scorched earth policy on the opposite coasts of Kwangtung, Fukien and Chekiang provinces, burning crops and villages to a depth of about eight to 30 miles. There was significant move of population from this area to Taiwan, and a wave of “overseas” Chinese migrants to Southeast Asia (see Purcell, 1965). There were other major population losses in the Taiping and other anti–Manchu rebellions in the 1850s and 1860s. As a result of these and associated famine and disease, Chinese population dropped by more than 50 million from 1850 to 1870. China also suffered significant losses from 1840 to 1945 from aggression by West European countries, Japan and Russia and from its own civil war from 1937 to 1949. Japan never suffered from foreign invasions, and the two main episodes of civil war in the latter half of the twelfth century when the first (Kamakura) shogunate was established, and from 1467 to 1568, were much smaller in their impact than the wars China experienced.

A Precocious Demographic Transition in Tokugawa Japan 

After a century of rapid expansion, Japanese population growth slowed markedly from the early eighteenth to the mid–nineteenth century. The slowdown reflected a precocious transition to lowered levels of mortality and fertility, and to life expectation higher than the Asian norm. The transition was analogous in some respects to that experienced in West European countries from the mid–nineteenth to the twentieth century. 

http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/301542223888 43 The Contours of World Development 

Japanese demographic records for the eighteenth century have certain deficiencies, but they are much better than those for earlier centuries. In the past 40 years they have been subjected to meticulous scrutiny by a new generation of historical demographers inspired by the pioneering and prolific work of Akira Hayami. As a result the interpretation of this period has changed completely. The eighteenth century slowdown was once attributed to Malthusian immiseration but is now characterised as a period of rising welfare. There is little doubt that population was stagnant from 1721 to 1846 when the best Tokugawa statistics were available, and there is reasonable evidence that it was expanding much faster in the seventeenth century. There are grounds for believing that birth rates were relatively low and life expectation relatively high, but there is controversy about life expectation. The most credible estimates range from 32 to 37 years. The spread reflects uncertainty which arises from the absence of direct evidence on infant mortality and the need for inferential procedures as explained in the notes to Table 1–4. The traditional method of family limitation in Japan (as in China) was abortion and infanticide. In the eighteenth century, family size was further reduced by late marriage, and lower levels of marital fertility. The change was induced by new institutional arrangements, rising per capita income and increased per capita labour inputs. Early in the seventeenth century, the Tokugawa regime compelled its military elite ( daimyo ) to move their vassals ( samurai ) from the countryside to castle towns. The peasantry were no longer closely controlled, and were much freer to capture gains in productivity for themselves. There were large rice levies to provide stipends for the samurai , but these were more or less fixed and the tax burden declined over time. In the seventeenth century, there were large land reclamation and irrigation projects, improved seeds, increased use of fertiliser. The proportion of land devoted to double cropped rice increased significantly, there was a rapid expansion of new commercial crops (cotton, sericulture, oil seeds, sugar and tobacco) and industrial by–employments. These changes brought increased real income, but required more intensive labour, with a particularly heavy additional load for women (Saito, 1996). In these circumstances, large families came to be regarded as a burden. By reducing dependency, per capita income could be raised or more easily sustained. Family restriction was also socially acceptable. Villages had a collective responsibility to provide the compulsory rice levy, so the welfare of the whole village community was safeguarded by lower dependency rates. The danger that the family line would die out was covered by the widespread practice of adopting adults (e.g. sons–in– law) who would take over the family name and ultimately the family assets. The Japanese inheritance system was more or less equivalent to primogeniture with reversion to a single heir, rather than the system of partible inheritance which prevailed in China. Japanese death and birth rates increased somewhat in the last quarter of the nineteenth century. Some of the rise may have been more apparent than real because of a change in official attitudes and practice. These changed from Tokugawa tolerance of abortion and infanticide to repression, and these practices were easier to detect because the new Meiji population registration system had much more effective coverage. However, Japanese family size and population growth continued to be fairly modest by subsequent standards elsewhere in Asia.

II GDP P ER C APITA 

Long–term estimates of world GDP are very recent. Research on real income growth by quantitative economic historians has been heavily concentrated on Europe, and generally confined to the past two centuries. Until recently what was known about earlier centuries was in large degree conjectural. Maddison (1995 a) contained detailed estimates for different parts of the world economy for 1820 onwards, with a very crude provisional assessment for 1500 to 1820. Here I have made a much more careful scrutiny of the evidence for centuries before 1820 and incorporated the results of Maddison (1998 a) on Chinese economic performance over two millennia. There is still a substantial degree of conjecture, but Appendices A and B present my evidence and assumptions as transparently as possible, so that critical readers can easily modify, adjust or augment my results where they find them open to question. The level and movement of per capita GDP is the primary general purpose indicator of changes in well–being and production potential, but one should keep in mind that per capita consumption has increased less over the long run because of the increased share of product allocated to investment and government. Labour productivity does not always move parallel to per capita income. The advances achieved in Sung China (960–1279) and in Japan in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries required substantial increases in per capita labour effort. In the twentieth century we find the opposite phenomenon. Labour input per person fell substantially in Western Europe and Western Offshoots (see Appendix E). Table 1–3 summarises my findings for the past millennium. It shows clearly the exceptionalism of Western Europe’s very lengthy ascension, and origins of the great divergence between the West (Group A) and the rest of the world (Group B). The major conclusions I draw from the long term quantitative evidence are as follows: 

a) West European income was at a nadir around the year 1000. Its level was significantly lower than it had been in the first century. It was below that in China, India and other parts of East and West Asia; 

b) There was a turning point in the eleventh century when the economic ascension of Western Europe began. It proceeded at a slow pace, but by 1820 real income had tripled. The locus and characteristics of economic leadership changed. The North Italian city states and, in particular, Venice initiated the growth process and reopened Mediterranean trade. Portugal and Spain opened trade routes to the Americas and Asia, but were less dynamic than the Netherlands which became the economic leader around 1600, followed by the United Kingdom in the nineteenth century; 

c) Western Europe overtook China (the leading Asian economy) in per capita performance in the fourteen century (see Figure 1–4). Thereafter China and most of the rest of Asia were more or less stagnant in per capita terms until the second half of the twentieth century. The stagnation was initially due to indigenous institutions and policy, reinforced by colonial exploitation which derived from Western hegemony and was most marked from the eighteenth century onwards; 

d) West European appropriation of the natural resources of North America, introduction of European settlers, technology and organisation added a substantial new dimension to Western economic ascension from the eighteenth century onwards. Towards the end of the nineteenth century, the United States became the world economic leader; 

e) Japan was an exception to the Asian norm. In the course of the seventeenth, eighteenth and the first half of the nineteenth century, it caught up with and overtook China in per capita income. The Meiji takeover in 1868 involved massive institutional change aimed at catching up with the West. This was achieved in income terms in the 1980s, but not yet in productivity; 47 The Contours of World Development 

f) The colonial takeover in Latin America had some analogy to that in North America, but Iberian institutions were less propitious to capitalist development than those in North America. Latin America included a much larger indigenous population which was treated as an underclass without access to land or education. The social order was not greatly changed after independence. Over the long run the rise in per capita income was much smaller than in North America, but faster than in Asia or Africa; 

g) African per capita income was lower in 1820 than in the first century. Since then there has been slower advance than in all other regions. The income level in 1998 was little better than that of Western Europe in 1820. Population growth is now faster than in any other region — eight times as fast as in Western Europe; 

h) The most dynamic growth performance has been concentrated on the past two centuries. Since 1820 per capita income has risen 19–fold in Group A, and more than 5–fold in the rest of the world — dwarfing any earlier advance and compressing it into a very short time span. One may ask what is new in these findings. In the first place there is the quantification which clarifies issues that qualitative analysis leaves fuzzy. It helps to separate stylised facts from the stylised fantasies which are sometimes perceived to be reality. It is more readily contestable and likely to be contested. It sharpens scholarly discussion, and contributes to the dynamics of the research process. It is also useful to have a world picture because it helps to identify what is normal and what is exceptional. My findings differ in some respects from earlier interpretations of the length and pace of Western Europe’s economic ascension. There has been a general tendency to date it from 1500 when Europeans encountered America and first made a direct entry into the trading world of Asia. Max Weber attributed Europe’s advance to the rise of protestantism, and this thesis attracted attention because it was congruent with the conventional wisdom about the beginning of the European ascension. I no longer believe that there was a sharp break in the pace of advance of per capita income around 1500. Kuznets (1966, Chapter 1) suggested that “modern economic growth” is a distinctive economic epoch preceded by merchant capitalism in Western Europe “from the end of the fifteenth to the second half of the eighteenth century,” and an “antecedent epoch of feudal organisation.” In Kuznets (1973, pp. 139–41), he advanced what seemed to be a reasonable view about the rate of per capita GDP growth in Western Europe in the merchant capitalist period. In Maddison (1995 a), I accepted Kuznets’ hypothesis for his merchant capitalist period, but I now believe that growth was slower then than Kuznets suggested, and that the pace of advance between the eleventh and the fifteenth centuries was not much different. For this reason, it does not seem valid to distinguish between epochs of “feudal organisation” and “merchant capitalism”. Instead I would characterise the whole period 1000–1820 as “protocapitalist”. I also differ from Kuznets on the timing of the transition to what he called “modern economic growth” (which I call “capitalist development”). The evidence now available suggests that the transition took place around 1820 rather than in 1760. The revisionist work of Crafts (1983 and 1992) and others has helped to break the old notion of a sudden take–off in the second half of the eighteenth century in England. Recent research on the Netherlands shows income to have been higher there than in the United Kingdom at the end of the eighteenth century. Work in the past twenty years on the quantitative history of other West European countries provides further reason for postdating the transition and modifying the old emphasis on British exceptionalism. My analysis of US economic performance shows a rapid advance in the eighteenth century in contrast to the findings of Gallman (1972) and Mancall and Weiss (1999). The essential reason for the difference is that I include rough estimates of the indigenous population and its GDP as well as the activity of European settlers (I also did this for Australia, Canada and New Zealand). My assessment of Japanese development differs from the conventional wisdom. I have quantified its economic performance in the Tokugawa period and compared it with China. Most analysts concentrate on comparisons between Japan and Western Europe in the Meiji period, and ignore the Asian context.

Gerschenkron (1965) and Rostow (1960 and 1963) both emphasised the idea that “take–offs” were staggered throughout the nineteenth century in West European countries. Kuznets (1979, p. 131) endorsed this view. In fact growth acceleration was more synchronous in Western Europe than they believed. There are two schools of thought about the relative performance of Europe and Asia. The mainstream view was clearly expressed by Adam Smith in 1776. He was not a practitioner of political arithmetic but on the basis of the “price of labour” and other evidence, his ordinal ranking from the top downwards was as follows for the 1770s: 49 The Contours of World Development 

Netherlands England France British North American colonies Scotland Spain Spanish colonies in America China Bengal (depressed by the East India Company’s plundering) This mainstream view is reflected in Landes (1969, p. 13–14) whose overall assessment, like that of Smith, was similar to mine. “Western Europe was already rich before the Industrial Revolution — rich by comparison with other parts of the world of that day. This wealth was the product of centuries of slow accumulation, based in turn on investment, the appropriation of extra–European resources and labour, and substantial technological progress, not only in the production of material goods, but in the organisation and financing of their exchange and distribution ... it seems clear that over the near–millennium from the year 1000 to the eighteenth century, income per head rose appreciably — perhaps tripled.” In Maddison (1983), I contrasted the Landes view with Bairoch’s (1981) assessment of relative income per head. He suggested that China was well ahead of Western Europe in 1800, Japan and the rest of Asia only 5 per cent lower than Europe, Latin America well ahead of North America, and Africa about two thirds of the West European level. This highly improbable scenario was never documented in the case of Asia, Latin America or Africa. His figures for these areas were essentially guesstimates. Bairoch consistently took the position that the third world had been impoverished by the rich countries (see Bairoch, 1967), and he was, in fact, fabricating ammunition for this hypothesis (see the critique of Chesnais, 1987). In spite of its shaky foundations, Bairoch’s assessment has been influential. Braudel (1985, vol. 3 pp. 533–4) acknowledged “the great service Paul Bairoch has rendered to historians” and believed “it is virtually beyond question that Europe was less rich than the worlds it was exploiting, even after the fall of Napoleon”. Andre Gunder Frank (1998, pp. 171 and 284) cites Bairoch and suggests that “around 1800 Europe and the United States, after long lagging behind, suddenly caught up and then overtook Asia economically and politically”. Pomeranz (2000) cites Bairoch more cautiously (p. 16) but his sinophilia drives him to the same conclusion. He suggests (p. 111), there is “little reason to think that West Europeans were more productive than their contemporaries in various other densely populated regions of the Old World prior to 1750 or even 1800.” Maddison (1983) contrasted the assessments of Landes and Bairoch and commented: “These remarkably different quantitative conclusions have very different analytical implications. If Bairoch is right, then much of the backwardness of the third world presumably has to be explained by colonial exploitation, and much less of Europe’s advantage can be due to scientific precocity, centuries of slow accumulation, and organisational and financial prosperity.” In view of the laborious efforts I have since made to accumulate quantitative evidence on this topic, I now conclude that Bairoch and his epigoni are quite wrong. To reject them is not to deny the role of colonial exploitation, but this can be better understood by taking a more realistic view of Western strength and Asian weakness around 1800.

The major problem in growth analysis is to explain why such a large divergence developed between the advanced capitalist group and the rest of the world. There are, of course, some examples of past convergence, e.g. Europe’s rise from its nadir to overtake China , the Japanese catch–up with China in Tokugawa times, and subsequently with the advanced capitalist group. Western Europe achieved a very substantial degree of catch–up on the United States in the golden age after the second world war; resurgent Asia (China, India, the so–called tigers and others) have narrowed their degree of backwardness substantially over the past quarter century. In attempting to understand the causes of divergence and the possibilities for catch–up in different parts of the world economy, there is no universal schema which covers the whole millennium. The operative forces have varied between place and period. Chapter 2 attempts to illuminate the changes in the character of economic leadership and backwardness which have occurred over the past millennium. The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 51 Chapter 2 

# The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World, 1000–1950 

A major feature of world development which emerges from our macro–statistical evidence is the exceptionalism of Western Europe’s long–run economic performance. By the year 1000, its income levels had fallen below those in Asia and North Africa. In its lengthy resurrection, it caught up with China (the world leader) in the fourteenth century. By 1820, its levels of income and productivity were more than twice as high as in the rest of the world. By 1913 , the income level in Western Europe and its Western Offshoots was more than six times that in the rest of the world. In order to understand the forces which made for the Western ascension, and the reasons for its greater dynamism than the rest of the world, it is useful to scrutinise the interaction of the West with the Rest over the long run. It is not feasible to embark on a comprehensive survey of all parts of the world economy. This chapter therefore presents four case histories. A great advantage of this detailed scrutiny is that it demonstrates how misleading it is to treat Western experience as homogeneous or monolithic. The first deals with the Venetian Republic — the richest and most successful West European economy from the eleventh to the sixteenth century. Portugal is the second case. It was never as rich as Venice, but developed ship design and navigational techniques which made it possible to open up new routes and commercial contact with Africa and Asia. Portugal pioneered European expansion into the Atlantic, discovered Brazil in 1500 and began three centuries of colonial development in the Americas. The Netherlands is the third case. It was the European leader in terms of per capita income between 1600 and 1820, with a high degree of international openness and specialisation, and a very large trading empire in Asia. The United Kingdom is our fourth case. It followed the Dutch model of international specialisation and commercial development, built a much bigger colonial empire, and was a pioneer in industrial and transport technology. Concentration on Western exceptionalism may be considered Eurocentric, but Western countries were the most successful and their experience is the best basis for understanding the roots of economic growth. Analysis of their interaction with the rest of the world throws light on the origins of economic backwardness, and the extent to which Western advance may have contributed to this. The process of Western ascension involved violence against other parts of the world. European colonisation of the Americas involved the extermination, marginalisation or conquest of its indigenous populations. European contact with Africa was for three centuries concentrated on the slave trade. There were European wars with Asian countries from the mid–eighteenth to the mid–twentieth century designed to establish or maintain colonies and trading privileges. However, Western economic advance also involved devastating wars and beggar–your–neighbour policies. Venetian advance provoked conflicts with Genoa, The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 52 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

Portugal clashed with the Dutch. The Netherlands was involved in an 80 year struggle for independence from Spain, four wars with Britain and more with France. The United Kingdom was involved in over 60 years of war with other West European countries from 1688 to 1815, and another ten years from 1914 to 1945. Before starting on the detailed case studies, it is useful to present a brief overview of West European performance from the first to the tenth centuries, and from 1000 to 1500.

In the first and second centuries, the Roman Empire was at its peak, a political entity that stretched from the Scottish border to Egypt, with a population of 20 million in Europe, another 20 million in Western Asia and 8 million in North Africa 1. Within this area there was a common legal framework, and the security of the pax romana. There were about 40 000 miles of paved road 2; 5 per cent of the population was urban with an active secular culture 3. The major cities were supplied with aqueducts, public baths and fountains, amphitheatres, libraries, temples and other public monuments. The Mediterranean was a Roman lake with tribute shipments of grain from Alexandria and Carthage to the Roman ports of Puteoli (near Naples) and Portus Novus (near Rome). Silk and spices from Asia came overland via Antioch, and up the Red Sea to Egypt. By the first century, Roman citizens (Greeks, Syrians and Jews) had discovered how to use the monsoon winds to trade directly with Western India 4.Roman imperialism was based on plunder, enslavement and ability to exercise control through military force. The strains in running such a large system were already obvious when Diocletian created separate Western and Eastern Empires in 285. Eventually the Western Empire’s capacity to levy taxes and tribute eroded. It relied increasingly on barbarians to man its armed forces. When they revolted, the system collapsed. By the fifth century the West Roman Empire had disintegrated. Gaul, Spain, Carthage and most of Italy were taken over by illiterate barbarian invaders and Britain was abandoned. There was a brief reprise in the sixth century when the East Roman Emperor recovered Italy, Spain and North Africa. The final blow came with the Arab takeover of Egypt, North Africa, Spain, Sicily, Syria and Palestine between 640 and 800. The only remnant of Roman civilisation was the rump of the Byzantine Empire. The main changes between the first and tenth centuries were a) the collapse of a large scale cohesive political unit which was never resurrected, and its replacement by a fragmented, fragile and unstable polity; b) disappearance of urban civilisation and predominance of self–sufficient, relatively isolated and ignorant rural communities where a feudal elite extracted an income in kind from a servile peasantry; 

c) the virtual disappearance of trading links between Western Europe, North Africa and Asia 5.The Belgian historian Pirenne (1939) provided a succinct description of the situation in the ninth century: “If we consider that in the Carolingian epoch, the minting of gold had ceased, the lending of money at interest was prohibited, there was no longer a class of professional merchants, that Oriental products (papyrus, spices and silk) were no longer imported, that the circulation of money was reduced to a minimum, that laymen could neither read or write, that taxes were no longer organised, and that the towns were merely fortresses, we can say without hesitation that we are confronted by a civilisation that had retrogressed to the purely agricultural stage; which no longer needed commerce, credit and regular exchange for the maintenance of the social fabric.” 6The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 53

Between the years 1000 and 1500, Western Europe’s population grew faster than any other part of the world. Northern countries grew significantly faster than those bordering the Mediterranean. The urban proportion (in terms of towns with more than 10 000 population) rose from zero to 6 per cent, a clear indicator of expansion in manufacturing and commercial activity. Factors making it possible to feed the increased population were an increase in the area of rural settlement, particularly in the Netherlands, Northern Germany and the Baltic coast and the gradual incorporation of technological changes which raised land productivity. The classic analysis of these rural changes is by Lynn White (1962): “…the heavy plough, open fields, the new integration of agriculture and herding, three field rotation, modern horse harness, nailed horseshoes and whipple tree had combined into a total system of agrarian exploitation by the year 1100 to provide a zone of peasant prosperity stretching across Northern Europe from the Atlantic to the Dnieper.” White probably exaggerated the precocity of their impact and the degree of prosperity, but these technical improvements were clearly of fundamental importance. The switch from a two–field to a three–field system also increased food security and reduced the incidence of famine. A growing proportion of agricultural output went as inputs into clothing production (wool), wine and beer (cereals and vines) and fodder crops for an increased horse population. There was a degree of regional specialisation in food production with growing international trade in cereals, live cattle, cheese, fish and wine. Increased trade in salt and the reintroduction of spice imports helped improve the palatability and conservation of meat and fish. Increased use of water and windmills augmented the power available for industrial processes, particularly in new industries such as sugar production and paper making. There was international specialisation in the woollen industry. English wool was exported to Flanders for production of cloth which was traded throughout Europe. The silk industry was introduced in the twelfth century and had grown impressively in Southern Europe by 1500. There were big improvements in the quality of textiles and the varieties of colour and design available. Genoa introduced regular shipments of alum from Chios to Bruges in the thirteenth century. There were improvements in mining and metallurgy which helped transform and expand European weapons production (see Nef, 1987 and Cipolla, 1970). Improvements in shipping and navigation techniques from the eleventh to the fifteenth century underpinned the increase in trade in the Mediterranean, the Baltic, the Atlantic islands and the Northwest coast of Africa. There were big advances in banking, accountancy, marine insurance, improvements in the quality of intellectual life with the development and spread of universities, the growth of humanist scholarship and, at the end of the fifteenth century, the introduction of printing. There were important changes in the political order. Scandinavian raiders who had made attacks on England, the low countries, Normandy and deep into Russia had become traders and established effective systems of governance in Scandinavia itself, in England, Normandy and Sicily. The beginnings of a nation state system had emerged, with a reduction in the fragmentation of political power that had characterised the Middle Ages. The hundred years war (1337–1453) was not the last of the conflicts between England and France, but the national identity of the two countries was much more clearly defined after it was over. At the end of the fifteenth century, the reconquista had established Spanish identity in its modern form. In the Eastern Mediterranean, the situation was the reverse. The Ottoman Empire had taken Constantinople in 1453, and quickly extended its hegemony to the Balkans, Syria, Palestine, Egypt and North Africa.

Estimates of what happened to GDP in Europe and the rest of the world over this period are obviously subject to a wide margin of error. Chapter 1 and Appendix B explain the basis for my estimates as transparently as possible. I concluded that there was almost a doubling of West European per capita income from 1000 to 1500 compared with an improvement of about a third in China, less elsewhere in Asia, and some regression in Africa. It seems clear that West European levels of income and productivity were higher than in Asia and Africa at the end of the period whereas they had been lower in the year 1000. As far as West Asia and Egypt are concerned, this view seems to be shared by specialists in Muslim history, e.g. Abulafiah (1987) and Abu–Lughod (1989); for China/West European performance the evidence for this conclusion is examined in detail in Maddison (1998 a). Within Europe, the areas which made the most economic progress in this period were i) Flanders, which was the centre for wool production, international banking and commerce in Northern Europe; and ii) Italian city states — Florence, Genoa, Pisa, Milan and Venice. Of these the most successful and the richest was Venice. The dynamic forces of Venetian capitalist development are therefore scrutinised in some detail in the following section. 

III T HE V ENETIAN R EPUBLIC 

Venice played a major role in reopening the Mediterranean economy to West European commerce and developing links with Northern Europe. It created an institutional basis for commercial capitalism, made major progress in shipping technology, and helped transfer Asian and Egyptian technology in cane sugar production and processing, silk textiles, glassblowing and jewellery to the West. Venice was the most successful of the North Italian city states in creating and maintaining a republic dominated by a merchant capitalist elite. Thanks to its geographic position and willingness to defend itself, it was able to guarantee its autonomy and freedom from exactions by feudal landlords and monarchs. It created political and legal institutions which guaranteed property rights and the enforceability of contracts. It was a pioneer in developing foreign exchange and credit markets, banking and accountancy 7.It created what was effectively a government bond market, starting with compulsory loans on which interest was paid regularly. Its fiscal system was efficient and favourable to merchant profits and the accumulation of capital. The revenues came from excise levies and property taxes based on cadastral surveys. It was a tolerant and fairly secular state where foreign merchants (Armenians, Greeks and Jews) could operate as freely as locals. Although it was theoretically part of the catholic world, it enjoyed privileged relations with the Byzantine empire. It buttressed its ecclesiastical independence by acquiring the relics of St. Mark from Alexandria in 828. It was effectively independent of both Pope and Patriarch. Venetian diplomacy was highly professional, pragmatic, opportunistic and dedicated to the pursuit of its commercial interests. It adjusted amazingly well to political changes. In the ninth and tenth centuries its main commerce was to provision Constantinople with grain and wine from Italy, wood and slaves from Dalmatia and salt from its lagoons, taking silk and spices in return. Towards the end of the eleventh century, Byzantium was under pressure from the Seljuk Turks who seized Anatolia, and Frankish incursions into its Southern Italian territories. Venice secured commercial privileges (exemption from excise taxes) from Byzantium in 1082 in return for help in bolstering its naval defences. In 1204, by contrast, it played a major role in persuading the leaders of the fourth crusade to target Constantinople instead of Islam. As a result Venice acquired bases in Dalmatia and an empire in the Aegean. It took the southern half of the Peloponnese, Corfu and Crete. It occupied nearly half of Constantinople and gained access to trade in the Black Sea and Sea of Azov. In 1261, the Byzantine Emperor recaptured Constantinople and gave trade preferences and a territorial base to Venice’s rival, Genoa. However, Venice retained its Greek colonies and Venetian shipping was soon able to re–enter the Black Sea where trade was booming due to the Mongol reopening of the silk route through Central Asia. The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 55 

West European crusaders successfully attacked the Syrian and Palestinian coast and established small christian states in Antioch, Acre and Jerusalem between 1099 and 1291. They gave commercial privileges to Pisan and Genoan traders who had helped finance their conquest. The Venetians had not helped, but nevertheless managed to establish a trading base in Tyre. The Turkish Mameluke regime recaptured Syria and Palestine in 1291 and ruled Egypt until 1517. Here too, Venice managed to establish a privileged trading relationship, buying a large part of the Asian spices which the Karimi merchants of Alexandria brought to Egypt from Asia via the Red Sea. In return the Venetians sold metals, armour, woollens and slaves. The slaves came from the Balkans and Russia: males were destined for service in the Mameluke army, females for their harems. When the Ottoman Turks captured Constantinople in 1453, Venice quickly negotiated the maintenance of its trading rights, but in 1479, the Ottomans closed their access to the Black Sea. In 1517, they took over Egypt and terminated most of the Venetian trade in spices. Venice had important connections with Northern Europe. Trade with Flanders was carried out mainly at the Champagne fairs where Italian merchants bought woollen goods and sold silk, spices, alum, sugar and lacquer 8 . When the sea route was opened between the Western Mediterranean and the Atlantic, trade with Flanders was carried out directly by ship. A second route linked Venice with Augsburg, Nuremberg, Prague and Vienna via the Brenner Pass. German merchants brought metals and metal products (including silver). Venetians traded these metals up the Po Valley and in the Mediterranean. In 1318 the Fondaco dei Tedeschi was created in Venice to provide for the trading needs and lodging of German merchants. In building up its trade, Venice created a political empire. In 1171, the city had about 66 000 inhabitants, and was one of the three biggest in Western Europe until the sixteenth century when its population peaked around 170 000. Venice experienced three demographic catastrophes. In 1347–48, nearly 40 per cent of the population died when a galley brought the plague from the Black Sea port of Caffa. Two other attacks occurred in 1575–77 and 1630; each killing about a third of the population of the city 9.The Empire overseas ( dominio da mar ) included about half a million people. Between 1388 and 1499, Venice acquired territory on the Italian mainland ( terraferma ) which included Udine, Friuli, Vicenza, Padua, Verona, Bergamo, Rovigo and Cremona. In 1557 the population of these territories was about 1.5 million (see Table 2–1). The Venetian state played a leading role in commercial activity, being the major shipbuilder, leasing state–owned galleys to private enterprise, arranging the organisation and timing of convoys. It developed types of ship suitable for Venetian commerce and the conditions of trade in the Mediterranean. This state activity reduced costs for private traders by making commerce more secure from enemy attack. It also permitted smaller traders, with limited capital, to participate in international trade.

The biggest enterprise in Venice was the Arsenal, a public shipyard created in 1104. It was operative for centuries, and employed thousands of workers. There were major changes in ship construction and navigation techniques between the tenth and fourteenth centuries. Roman ships had been constructed hull first, held together by careful watertight cabinetwork of mortice and tenon; the second stage was the insertion of ribs and braces. In the eleventh century there was a switch which made a major reduction in costs. The keel and ribs were made first and a hull of nailed planks was added, using fibre and pitch to make the ships watertight. A later development was the stern–post rudder which replaced trailing oars as a more effective means for steering ships. The power of the rudders was strengthened by use of cranks and pulleys 10 . There were improvements in sails, notably the introduction of a triangular lateen rig set at an angle to the mast instead of a rectangular sail square to the mast. There was a long run increase in the size of ships (see Table 2–2). Soon after 1270, the compass came into use in the Mediterranean. This, together with improved charts, made it possible to sail all year round. Previously ships trading with Egypt had not ventured out between October and April. With the compass the same ship could make two return trips a year from Venice to Alexandria instead of one. There were two main kinds of Venetian ship. General purpose cargo ships (“cogs”) were built in private shipyards. Their length was about three times their breadth, and they relied entirely on sails. Galleys for passengers, high value cargo and naval duties were built in the Arsenal. These were longer, had a wide beam and a crew of 200 most of whom were oarsmen. Galleys were speedier, more manoeuvrable for entering and leaving harbour, and for occasions when there was no wind. The general Venetian practice was to have 25 benches on each side of the galley, each bench having three oarsmen. The benches were set at an angle and the oars were of different lengths so that the rowers would not interfere with each other. On such a ship there would be 150 oarsmen and about 30 crossbowmen for defence and attack, who would also take turns at rowing. Galleys were owned by the state and rented out for each venture to the highest bidder in public auctions. Galleys also acted as public carriers, as those who leased the ships had to accept goods from other merchants if they had spare capacity. In 1291, the Genoese defeated a Moroccan fleet controlling the straits of Gibraltar, and opened the way for European commerce from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic 11 . Thereafter Venetian galleys used this route to trade with London and Bruges. Although international trade, banking, shipbuilding and associated trades in timber, carpentry, rope and sailmaking etc. were the biggest sectors of the Venetian economy, there were also sizeable manufacturing activities producing goods for local use and export. One of the earliest was the glass industry which had already started in the tenth century. Venice was a pioneer in glassblowing technology in Europe and made glasses, goblets, pitchers, dishes, bottles, vases, mirrors, jewellery, candelabra and decorative products of very high quality. From the thirteenth century Venetians produced delicate, carefully blown sand–glasses as a time–keeping device for mariners. From the fourteenth century onwards they started making spectacles — an Italian invention which greatly increased the productivity of artisans and scholars 12 . Angelo Barovier, the most famous glassblower of the fifteenth century, perfected the process for making crystal. By that time, polychrome, engraved, filigree, enamelled and gold– leafed glassware was available in a profuse variety of designs. In 1291 all glassblowing was shifted to the island of Murano by decree of the Maggior Consilio. This enabled Venice to keep tighter control of its trade and technological secrets. Equally precocious were the skills and products of Venetian goldsmiths, mosaicists, woodcarvers and decorative artists who were in heavy demand in turning the inside of churches, civic monuments and private palaces into works of art. Venetian style was influenced by the work of previous generations of mosaicists and iconographers in Ravenna and the thirteenth century inflow of objects looted from Constantinople.

The trade with Asia in raw silk and silk products eventually led to import substitution in Europe. Silk production had already spread from China to India and Syria, and came to Italy in the twelfth century — initially to Lucca, then to Venice, Florence, Genoa, Milan and Bologna, and later to Lyon in France. Within the Arab world, silk production came to Spain from Syria. Venetian silk production is documented as early as the thirteenth century. The Venetian government regulated production to guarantee quality, keep out competitors and reduce the risk of industrial espionage. The silk, satin and velvet products of Venice were of the highest quality, and designs were a distinctive mix of indigenous creativity and oriental influence. Multicoloured velvet brocades, often executed with gold and silver thread, were produced as items of ceremonial clothing for Venice’s governing elite, for furniture, wall hangings, table coverings, decorative items for gondolas etc. These products made a substantial contribution to Venetian exports. Another important field was book production. In the ninth and tenth centuries, scribes and illuminators were mainly active on sacred books in the scriptoria of monasteries. Later there were civic records, histories, translations of Aristotle and other Greek texts destined for the libraries of San Marco, ducal, civic and private collectors. This gave employment to professional scribes, bookbinders, specialists in ornamented calligraphy and illustration. Less than 15 years after Gutenberg’s invention of printing, a German immigrant brought the technique to Venice in 1469. It led to an enormous improvement in the productivity of the industry, with print runs up to 4 500 copies. A very much larger proportion of output was destined for export than had been the case for manuscript books. Venice quickly became the principal Italian typographical centre, and one of the biggest in Europe. By the middle of the sixteenth century, some 20 000 editions had been published. Venetian publishing helped invigorate the cultural and intellectual life of Europe by providing music scores, maps, books on medical matters and translations of the Greek classics. The Aldine Press (set up in 1494) edited and published original Greek texts, and Venice became the major publisher of books for the Greek–speaking world 13 .Sugar was another major product. Venice created plantation agriculture and processing facilities with slave labour in Crete and Cyprus, using techniques borrowed from Syria. Venetian practice was copied later by the Portuguese in Madeira and in Brazil. The Venetian role in the spice trade was greatly reduced at the beginning of the sixteenth century because of restrictions on trade with Syria and Egypt imposed by the new Ottoman authorities, and competition from direct Portuguese shipments from Asia. Lane (1966, p. 13) suggests that Venetian spice imports fell from around 1 600 tons a year towards the end of the fifteenth century to less than 500 tons by the first decade of the sixteenth century. Lane thought that the absolute size of the pepper component of these shipments had recovered by the 1560s, but Venice’s leading role in this trade had obviously evaporated. Venetian shipping also faced increased competition on Western routes to England and Flanders, and its sugar industry in Crete and Cyprus declined because of competition from Portuguese production in Madeira and later in Brazil. There were also changes in shipbuilding technology in the Atlantic economies which quickly rendered the oared Venetian galley obsolete. The two main changes were in the rigging of round ships and the development of firearms during the fifteenth century. Lane (1966, pp. 15–16) described these changes as follows: “The transformation of the one–masted cog into a full–rigged, three–masted ship possessed of spritsail, topsail and mizzen lateen occurred about the middle of the century — the sailing ships of 1485 differed less in appearance from the sailing ships of 1785 than they did from those of 1425 — equally important in robbing the merchant galley of the special security which had alone justified its existence was the increase in the use of guns in naval warfare.” As a result there was a sharp decline in the main product of the Arsenal and a rise in the share of cogs in the Venetian merchant fleet. There was increased purchase by Venetian merchants of ships from abroad, as problems of adapting to technological change were compounded by much poorer Venetian access to cheap timber than shipbuilders in the Atlantic economies. The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 59 

From 1500 onwards, a significant proportion of Venetian capital was reoriented to agrarian reclamation and development and creation of Palladian villas and country estates in the terraferma .Over the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, Venice did not expand much in population or per capita income, but it remained one of the richest parts of Italy and Europe until overtaken by the Dutch in the seventeenth century. 

IV P ORTUGAL 

Portugal emerged from Arab rule between 1147 when Lisbon was captured and 1249 when full sovereignty was established in an area corresponding roughly to its present boundaries. Its political regime was very different from that of Venice. Its reconquista was due mainly to militant crusading orders of knighthood. The military aristocracy and the church became the major landowners. In Portugal, as in Spain, the interests of church and state were closely linked. The crown was able to nominate bishops and collect ecclesiastical taxes, under a patronage system known as the “padroado real”. Although there were some clashes between Portugal and Spain, and for a time (1580–1640) Portugal had a Spanish king, there was a remarkably effective long–term territorial division of interests between the two countries. Under various treaties sanctioned by the Papacy, Portugal was able to develop its commercial and imperial interests in Africa, in the whole of Asia except the Philippines, and in Brazil without significant Spanish interference. Portugal had three major advantages in developing its overseas commerce and empire. There was a clear strategic benefit in being located on the South Atlantic coast of Europe near to the exit of the Mediterranean. Deep–sea fishermen provided an important part of the Portuguese food supply and developed an unrivalled knowledge of Atlantic winds, weather and tides. The value of these skills was greatly enhanced by crown sponsorship of Atlantic exploration, research on navigation technology, training of pilots, and documentation of maritime experience in the form of route maps with compass bearings (rutters) and cartography. Portuguese shipbuilding in Lisbon and Oporto adapted the design of its ships (caravels) and rigging in the light of increasing knowledge of Atlantic sailing conditions. The biggest changes were in rigging. At first they concentrated on lateen sails, then added a mix of square sails and lateen for deeper penetration into the South Atlantic, with further changes for the much longer route round the Cape. Knowledge of these techniques was protected by forbidding sales of ships to other countries. A third commercial advantage was Portugal’s ability to absorb “new Christians” — Jewish merchants and scholars had played a significant role during Muslim rule. They were driven out of Spain, but many took refuge and increased the size of the community in Portugal. They were required to undergo proforma conversion and were subject to a degree of persecution, but they provided important skills in developing Portuguese business interests in Africa, Brazil and Asia, in scientific development, as intermediaries in trade with the Muslim world and in attracting Genoese and Catalan capital to Portuguese business ventures. A fourth important influence on the pattern of Portuguese business interests was the heritage of slavery. In most parts of Western Europe, slavery had more or less disappeared in the middle ages, though it was a peripheral part of Venetian trade with Byzantium and the Muslim world. Portugal had lived in closer contact with the Muslim world than any other part of Western Europe. Portuguese themselves had had experience of being slaves and about ten per cent of the population in Lisbon were berber or black slaves. They were also used as a labour force in the sugar plantations and sugar mills which Portugal developed in Madeira and São Tomé. Significant Portuguese activity in slave trading in Africa began around 1445 shortly after Portuguese navigators discovered and settled the Cape Verde islands (opposite Senegal). They were able to buy slaves from African merchants in this region in return for cloth, horses, trinkets and salt. Between 1450 and 1600 The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 60 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

about 175 000 slaves were shipped to Portugal and its Atlantic islands. Later, as the trade developed, Portugal became more directly involved in capturing slaves further south in Angola. The crown organised the Casa de Escravos in Lisbon in the 1480s. The trade was highly profitable and expanded enormously at the end of the sixteenth and in the seventeenth century when Portugal shipped slaves to Brazil and handled most of the slave shipments to Spanish America (under slave trading permits ( asiento ) sold by the Spanish government). The slave trade received Papal legitimacy in 1455 with the bull Romanus Pontifex ,which construed it as a form of missionary activity. Between 1500 and 1870, 9.4 million slaves were shipped to the Americas. About 4.5 million of these were supplied by Portugal. The Portuguese crown took the initiative in exploring and developing the Atlantic islands and their sugar industry, and in creating a maritime bypass of the old caravan route which carried gold from Timbuktu in Mali to the Moroccan coast. This route had supplied two thirds of the gold entering Europe. The leading role in these two developments was played by Prince Henrique (third son of the Portuguese king, John I, and nephew of the English king, Henry IV). For four decades (1420–1460) he applied his considerable financial resources to these ventures and prepared the ground for the later Portuguese breakthrough into Asian trade by developing navigational expertise 14 .In 1420, the crown took over the administration of the wealthy military orders. Henrique became administrator of the Order of Christ (successor to the Templars in Portugal), and his brother acquired a similar position in the Order of Santiago. Henrique used the assets of his Order to finance ventures in the Atlantic and Africa, and persuaded successive rulers (his brothers) to invest him personally with significant property rights in both areas.

Madeira (about 560 km into the Atlantic from the Moroccan coast) was discovered in 1420. It was uninhabited and extremely fertile. A sugar industry was developed with use of slave labour on similar lines to Venetian practice in Cyprus and Crete. The two sectors of the industry were cane plantations and sugar mills, with the bigger enterprises covering both activities. The industry was developed by leases to Genoese and “new Christian” entrepreneurs. Capital requirements were fairly substantial and the newest techniques were adopted in the mills. Instead of the large circular stone that was rolled over cut cane in the Venetian controlled mills, a new type of press with two cylindrical rollers was able to get more juice from the cane which no longer needed to be cut. The presses were operated with animal or water power rather than manually 15 . Production expanded faster after Henrique’s death, when the industry was less tightly controlled. By 1500 Madeiran production was more than six times as big as that of Cyprus where output had plummeted. Portuguese sugar replaced it on the markets of Antwerp and Bristol. In addition to sugar, Madeira was a major source of timber. Wheat and wine production was also significant. The wine was of the malmsey type which the Venetians had brought to Crete from Syria. The uninhabited Azores were discovered in mid–Atlantic (about 1 300–1 500 km from Portugal) in 1427 and settlement started in 1439. They were not very suitable for sugar production, but were a useful staging post for subsequent Atlantic trade, and augmented Portuguese knowledge of navigation in the Atlantic. In developing navigation on the African coast, Portugal established settlements in two other significant island outposts. The Cape Verde islands were settled in 1460 and acted as a staging post for the slave trade. In this area, the Portuguese found malaguette (a coarse pepper substitute) and later a better quality pepper in Benin. Further east, São Tomé and Principe (in the Bight of Guinea) were settled after 1480. Sugar production was introduced and by the 1550s had supplemented Madeira as the major centre of Atlantic production. In 1482, Elmina fort was built on the coast of what is now Ghana. This was centre of the gold trade. Gold became the biggest source of income for the Portuguese crown. At Elmina the main source was Ashanti gold, at trading points on the Guinea coast it was gold diverted to Portuguese traders from the caravan route from Timbuktu to Morocco. Total gold exports of West Africa between 1471 and 1500 amounted to 17 tons. This helped the Portuguese crown to finance its most expensive venture — the opening of a Cape route to Asian trade 16 .Circumnavigation of Africa in order to get direct access to the spices of Asia was not a new idea. The Vivaldi brothers had set out from Genoa in 1291 and disappeared in the attempt. By the end of the fifteenth century, it was clear that such a venture would be very expensive and highly risky, but political developments in the Eastern Mediterranean suggested that the old Venetian route through Egyptian and Syrian middlemen was under threat, and that the potential profits from a new route would be very rewarding. The Portuguese had an unrivalled knowledge of sailing conditions in the Atlantic and halfway down the African coast. There had been developments in ship design, rigging and seamanship which made it possible to contemplate long–distance trips in stormier seas than the Venetians encountered in the Mediterranean. The preparations for this venture were carefully planned and spread over a couple of decades. They involved research on techniques of navigation, astronomy and cartography and collection of information on trading conditions in Asia and East Africa. The second component was a series of trial voyages to explore possible routes and wind patterns down the whole length of the African coast. The third component was a voyage to India to explore trading conditions and possibilities for establishing the sort of bases already established on the African coast. In the Mediterranean, navigators from the thirteenth century had relied on the compass to determine direction, a sandglass to measure time and a traverse board to measure deviations from course. As the main routes had been known since antiquity, they had reasonable charts, a fair idea of the distances they had to travel and rough methods for judging speed.

The Portuguese were now exploring unknown waters, and had to rely much more on celestial navigation. In the Northern hemisphere Portuguese navigators knew that the pole star provided a roughly constant bearing and altitude, maintaining roughly the same height on a particular parallel of latitude. On a north–south passage a navigator could observe the pole star each day at dawn and dusk (when he could see both the star and the horizon). By noting changes in altitude he could get some idea of changes in his position. In sailing east–west, he could keep a steady course by maintaining a constant polar altitude. All this had to be done very crudely using finger spreads or other rough means to estimate changes in altitude. Measurement was greatly refined by the invention of the quadrant, first recorded in 1460 by Gomes, a professional navigator in the employ of Prince Henry. Parry (1974, p. 174) describes the quadrant as follows: “The seaman’s quadrant was a very simple device; a quarter of a circle, with a scale marked on the curved edge, and with two pinhole sights along one of the straight edges. A plumb line hung from the apex. The sights were aligned on the star and the reading taken from the point where the plumb line cut the scale. Polar altitude in degrees gave the observer’s latitude.” This way a navigator could measure his distance from Lisbon, or some other place whose polar altitude he already knew. In the Southern hemisphere, the pole star was not visible, and there was no other star with the same properties. Instead the altitude of the sun had to be used but one could not study its position with the naked eye. In 1484, John II created a commission of mathematical experts and astronomers to observe and measure solar altitude. The instrument for measuring distance from the equator was the mariner’s astrolabe, derived from astrolabes used by medieval astronomers. It was a graduated brass disc, with a bar which was rotated until the point of light shining through the upper sight fell on to the lower one. It was used at midday when the sun was at its zenith. As there were no accurate clocks a series of readings had to be taken around what appeared to be midday, to derive the maximum altitude. As the distance between the equator and the sun changes from day to day and year to year, mariners needed accurate tables of the sun’s declination. John II’s commission produced a simplified version of the Almanach of the Jewish astronomer Zacuto, and successfully tested the possibilities of finding latitude on a trip to the African coast in 1485. Estimates of the sun’s declination were incorporated in a navigational manual Regimento do Astrolabio e do Quadrante which was available to da Gama when he sailed to India in 1497. Da Gama had direct contact with Zacuto who had come to Lisbon as a refugee from Spain. The Regimento also contained a translation of a work by a thirteenth century English mathematician, Holywood (known as Sacrobosco), who was a pioneer of spherical astronomy, pointed out the errors in the Julian calendar and suggested a correction more or less the same as that incorporated in the Gregorian calendar 350 years later. All this Portuguese research and development was done 50 years before Copernicus published his work on celestial orbits in 1543, but the committee would surely have had an immediate understanding of its significance. There were preparatory voyages to gauge the feasibility of a passage to India by Diogo Câo in 1482–4 and another by Bartolomeu Dias in 1487–8. Câo found the mouth of the Congo river and went past the future sites of Luanda and Benguela in Angola. The voyage of Dias was more rewarding. He had two caravels and a store ship, found a better route to Angola, and at Lüderitz Bay on the coast of Namibia, in the face of adverse winds, discovered it was useful to veer well out west into the Atlantic to catch winds which took him round the Cape. He sailed 1 000 kilometres east of the Cape before turning back. The trip took 18 months. He had sailed nearly 13 000 kilometres from Lisbon. The return passage was somewhat shorter because he found favourable winds from the Cape to the Azores. He had demonstrated that the Atlantic and Indian oceans were connected. There was also an exploratory trip by land. Pero da Covilhã had been a spy in Spain and Morocco, spoke fluent Arabic and could pass for a Muslim. Armed with letters of credit he went to Cairo via Barcelona, Naples, Rhodes and Alexandria, down the Red Sea coast by caravan, took a ship at Aden for Calicut (in Kerala) which was known to be the major Indian emporium for the spice trade with a hinterland in a rich spice–growing region. He made an extensive reconnaissance of the west coast of India as far north as Goa and the East African coast down to the port of Sofala. He sent a report on his findings in 1490 via a Portuguese emissary in Cairo, and acting on a second set of instructions he visited Hormuz, the centre of the spice trade in the Persian Gulf. The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 63 

Thus the Portuguese committee was well briefed on trading conditions in India and East Africa and possibilities of navigation in the Atlantic before entrusting Vasco da Gama with a passage to India in 1497–9. In 1484, John II received a proposition for a westward passage from Christopher Columbus, a Genoese navigator who had spent eight years in Portuguese ships sailing to the Atlantic islands and the Guinea coast. He asked the king “to give him some vessels to go and discover the Ile Cypango by this Western Ocean” (Morison, 1974, p. 31). The committee rejected the proposal because they thought Cypango (Japan) was a fiction of Marco Polo and that Columbus greatly underestimated the distance to Asia. Eventually the Columbus venture was financed by Queen Isabella of Spain. In 1492, he sailed to the Canary Islands, and from there reached the Bahamas in 33 days. He spent more than three months in the Caribbean where he found Cuba and Haiti without realising that the islands were in the middle of a huge unknown continent. Because of stormy weather on his return voyage, he was forced to land in Lisbon in 1493 for refitting, and had to brief John II. The Portuguese did not believe that Columbus had reached Asia, and knew he had not found spices. However, in anticipation of a flurry of Spanish maritime exploration, and to protect Portuguese interests, the Treaty of Tordesillas was negotiated with Spain in 1494. This stipulated that Portugal would not compete in the West Atlantic. On Portuguese insistence, the dividing line was fixed 370 leagues west of the Azores (about 48 degrees west of the Greenwich meridian). Portugal not only got a free hand for its Asian project and African interests, but established a legal claim to Brazil (which was found six years later). The last step in the preparation for da Gama’s voyage was to provide two specially built ships, constructed with advice from Dias. Jones (1978), p. 30, compares them with the caravels used by earlier navigators as follows: “a stouter, roomier craft, standing higher in the water and able successfully to navigate in coastal waters, better able to stand long periods in the ocean, safer in the tempests of the tropics, and with better quarters for the crew. He designed the vessels to have a foremast, and mainmast, square rigged with mainsail and topsail, a square spritsail at the bow and a small lateen–rigged mizzen stepped right aft on the castle. These probably provided a sail area, without bonnets, of about 4 000 sq. feet. Main and fore each had a crow’s nest — Length of hull was probably slightly under seventy–five feet, with a beam a third of that.” The ships “were about 200 tons register in present day terms”, they each had 20 guns firing stone balls weighing a few ounces. In addition, da Gama had a 50 ton caravel and a small supply ship. His crew of about 160 included gunners, musicians and three Arabic interpreters. He carried trade goods of a type used in West Africa (coarse cloth, bells and beads) which were virtually useless in Asia. Da Gama sailed from Lisbon in July 1497 to Cape Verde. Shortly thereafter (about 150 kilometres off Sierra Leone) instead of heading southeast which was the normal route down the African coast, he veered southwest far into the Atlantic and eventually caught winds which blew him southeast around the Cape. By Christmas he had rounded Africa, and moved up the East coast, visiting Mozambique, Mombasa and Malindi. Economic life there was much more sophisticated than in West Africa. The coastal towns had merchants — Arabs, Indians from Gujarat and Malabar and Persians — who imported silk and cotton textiles, spices and Chinese porcelain and exported cotton, timber and gold. They had professional pilots familiar with monsoon conditions in the Indian ocean. Their ships were sturdy, but the Portuguese noted that they were constructed without nails. Instead the timbers were stitched and bound together with ropes made of coconut fibre (coir) which was widely available in Southern India and Ceylon. The local population were an Afro–Arab mix, speaking Arabic and Swahili, wearing cotton clothing and using coined money. He was able to get a competent Gujarati pilot from the ruler of Malindi (in Kenya), who got him to Calicut (in Kerala) in less than a month. The Portuguese remained in Calicut for three months, discovered a good deal about prices and conditions in the spice market, but failed to establish amicable relations with the local ruler or to sell their trade goods. The return trip to Malindi took three months. They found it difficult to man the ships as many of the crew had died of scurvy, so they burned the São Gabriel (one of the specially built ships). They had already dismantled the supply ship on the outward journey. The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 64 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

The caravel returned to Lisbon in July 1499, and da Gama got back in August (having stopped to bury his brother in the Azores). In the two year voyage, he had lost half the crew and two of the ships, and had very little in the way of cargo. However, he had proved the feasibility of the route, found a new source of gold in East Africa, had established that there were no maritime fleets in the Indian Ocean which could impede Portuguese access to the spice trade. He also let it be known that there were Christians in Kerala 17 .This news was received enthusiastically in Lisbon, and there was a quick follow–up. In March 1500, Pedro Cabral was given command of 12 ships and more than 1 000 men to improve on the route, bring back a significant cargo and establish a base on the Kerala coast. There was fairly extensive private participation in the cost and benefits of the trip. Cabral went farther west in the Atlantic than da Gama and had the good luck, after a month at sea, to be the first navigator to encounter Brazil. He stayed a few days at a point he called Porto Seguro (about 350 km south of Bahia), and immediately sent a ship back to Lisbon to announce his finding territory which lay well within the area allotted to Portugal in the Treaty of Tordesillas 18 .On the East African coast he stopped off at Sofala and Kilwa which da Gama had missed, got a pilot in Malindi and was in Calicut within six months of leaving Lisbon. He stayed in Calicut for two months and was given a large house as a trading base (known as a factory). However, he had to leave in a hurry. The Portuguese seized a local vessel on its way to Gujarat and another leaving for Jedda on the Red Sea. In retaliation, local muslim traders attacked the Portuguese factory, killed over 50 Portuguese and took the trade goods. In return Cabral captured ten more local vessels and bombarded the unfortified town (see Subramanyam, 1997, pp. 180–1). He sailed 150 kilometres further down the coast to Cochin, where he was able to load additional cargo and create the basis for a permanent factory. He left some of his people behind for this purpose and took three Cochin representatives back to Portugal. Before leaving for Malindi, he stopped in Cannanur (about 70 kilometres north of Calicut) to pick up a cargo of cinnamon. Cabral arrived back in Lisbon around the beginning of July 1501 with five vessels. The cargo, mostly pepper, appears to have been around 700 tons 19 , but the loss of seven ships (six on the way out, one on the way back) and the violence in Calicut were not encouraging. Da Gama was sent on a second mission to India with a fleet of 20 ships, leaving Lisbon in February 1502. Fifteen of the ships were for the return journey, and another five (under the command of da Gama’s uncle) were destined to stay behind to protect Portuguese bases in India and to blockade shipping leaving India for the Red Sea. By June, da Gama had traversed the Cape and stopped at Sofala to buy gold. At Kilwa, he forced the local ruler to agree to pay an annual tribute of pearls and gold, and left there for India. He waited offshore at Cannanur, for ships returning from the Red Sea. He captured one returning from Mecca with pilgrims and a valuable cargo. Part of the cargo was seized and the ship was burned with most of the passengers and crew (see Subrahmanyan, 1997, pp. 205–9). Then he put into Cannanur, and exchanged presents (he offered silver and got precious stones) with the local ruler, but did no business as he found the price of spices too high. He headed in the direction of Cochin, stopped his ships opposite Calicut and demanded that the ruler expel the whole Muslim merchant community (4 000 households) which used the port as a basis for trading with the Red Sea. The Samudri, the local Hindu ruler, refused, so da Gama bombarded the city as Cabral had done. He got to Cochin at the beginning of November, where he was able to buy spices against silver, copper and the textiles he had taken from the ship he sank. A permanent factory was set up in Cochin, and five ships were left to protect Portuguese interests. Before leaving for home, da Gama’s fleet was attacked by more than 30 ships financed by the Muslim traders of Calicut. They were routed after Portuguese bombardment, and part of the Muslim merchant community in Calicut decided to move their operations elsewhere. These naval engagements showed clearly the superiority of armed Portuguese ships over those of Asian countries. The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 65 

Da Gama returned to Lisbon in October 1503, with 13 of his ships and nearly 1 700 tons of spices, i.e. about the same as annual Venetian imports from the Middle East at the end of the fifteenth century. However, the Portuguese margins on this trade were much bigger than the Venetian. Most of these spices were marketed in Europe via Antwerp, which was the chief port of the Spanish Netherlands. The voyages of Dias, Cabral and da Gama had laid the foundations of the Portuguese trading empire in East Africa and Asia. Portugal held a monopoly of the traffic round the Cape until the last decade of the sixteenth century. The Mameluke regime in Egypt sent a fleet in 1509 to try to stop interference with shipping to the Red Sea but they were defeated by the Portuguese at Diu off the coast of Gujarat. However, Portugal did not succeed in establishing a base in the Red Sea, Aden was taken by Turkey in 1538, and the old Asian trade to Egypt was reopened from about the middle of the sixteenth century. Portugal did acquire a fortified position at Hormuz which dominated the entry to the Persian Gulf for about a century. There was no blockade of trade with the newly established regime in Safavid Persia, but traders entering the Gulf and those using other Portuguese bases had to pay for safe–conduct passes ( cartazes ). In addition Portugal levied customs duties on goods travelling through its Asian bases. Wake (1979), p. 377, provided a rough estimate of annual Portuguese spice imports. In the first half of the sixteenth century they averaged 1 475 metric tons a year, 1 160 in the second half. In 1600, total West European consumption was probably about twice the 1500 level, and per capita consumption had risen by half 20 .

The difference between departures from Lisbon and returns is due to losses, and in some cases returns to home port, but also to ships which remained in Asia to defend the bases or to participate in intra Asian trade. Once the trade was firmly established, the average duration of the outward trip Lisbon–Cochin was about 5.75 months, and 6.5 months for the return journey. The average size of vessels increased over time with a carrying capacity of 300 tons in the sixteenth century and up to 1 000 tons in the seventeenth. Table 2–8.

VT HE T RADING W ORLD OF THE I NDIAN O CEAN 

The population of Asia in 1500 was five times as big as that of Western Europe (284 million compared with 57 million), and the ratio was about the same in 1600. It was a very large market with a network of Asian traders operating between East Africa and India, and from Eastern India to Indonesia. East of the straits of Malacca, trade was dominated by China. Indian ships were not sturdy enough to withstand the typhoons of the China sea, and not adequately armed to deal with pirate activity off the China coast (see Chaudhuri, 1982, p. 410). The Portuguese displaced Asian traders who had supplied spices to Red Sea and Persian Gulf ports for onward sale to Venetian, Genoese and Catalan traders. But this was only a fraction, perhaps a quarter, of Asian trade in one group of commodities. In addition there was trade within Asian waters in textiles, porcelain, precious metals, carpets, perfume, jewellery, horses, timber, salt, raw silk, gold, silver, medicinal herbs and many other commodities. Hence, the spice trade was not the only trading opportunity for the Portuguese, or for the other later European traders (Dutch, British, French and others) who followed. Silk and porcelain played an increased role, and in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, cotton textiles and tea became very important. There were possibilities of participating in intra–Asian trade as well. In the 1550s to the 1630s this kind of trade between China and Japan was a particularly profitable source of income for Portugal. Asian merchants were familiar with the seasonal wind patterns and problems of the Indian Ocean, there were experienced pilots, scientific works on astronomy and navigation, and navigational instruments not greatly inferior to those of the Portuguese 21 .From East Africa to Malacca (on the narrow straits between Sumatra and Malaya), Asian trade was conducted by merchant communities which operated without armed vessels or significant interference from governments. Although Southern India, where the Portuguese started their Asian trade, was ruled by the Empire of Vijayanagar, conditions in coastal trade were set by rulers of much smaller political units, who derived income by offering protection and marketing opportunities to traders. The income of the rulers of Vijayanagar and later the Moghul Empire was derived from land taxes, and they had no significant financial interest in foreign trade activities. In China and Japan the situation was different.

Asian merchants operated in mutually interactive community networks with ethnic, religious, family or linguistic ties and an opportunistic concentration on profit. In this respect their trading habits were not very different from those of Venetians or of Jewish traders in the Arab world of the Mediterranean 22 . In Western Asia and the Middle East merchants were generally Arabs and Muslims, but further east they included “Gujarati vaniyas, Tamil and Telugu Chettis, Syrian Christians from Southwestern India, Chinese from Fukien and neighbouring provinces” 23 . If they paid for protection and market access, they found that they were free to trade. If the protection became too expensive they usually had some leeway for moving elsewhere. The Portuguese trading network was different in two respects. It consisted of a string of strongly fortified bases linked by a fleet of armed ships, so market forces were modified by coercion. Unlike the Asian trading communities or in the European trading companies which penetrated Asia at a later date, Portugal was involved in religious evangelism. The headquarters of the Portuguese trading empire was established in 1510 at the captured Arab port of Goa, an island harbour halfway up the west Indian coast which was a Portuguese colony for nearly 460 years 24 . It was the residence of the Portuguese Viceroy, and from 1542 it was the headquarters of the Jesuit order for all its operations in Asia. Malacca, the port which controlled trade and shipping from India to Indonesia and China, was captured in 1511 and kept until 1641 when it was taken by the Dutch. A base was established at Jaffna in Sri Lanka for trade in cinnamon. Most Portuguese shipments of pepper and ginger originated from the Malabar coast of India, but for higher value spices they obtained a base at Ternate in the Moluccas (between Celebes and New Guinea) for trade in cloves, nutmeg and mace.

Trading conditions were very different in Asia east of the Malacca straits. Establishment of trading relations with China and Japan was a much more difficult proposition than with countries in the Indian Ocean. Requests for access to China in 1513 and 1521–22 were rejected. It was not until 1557 that Portugal acquired Macao though it participated earlier in clandestine trade off the Chinese coast. Contact was made with Japan in 1543 and trade started there in earnest in the 1550s from the base in Macao. 

China 

China had withdrawn from an active role in Asian trade in the fifteenth century, imposed tight controls on private trade, and an embargo on trade with Japan. In view of the historic importance of this withdrawal, it is worth retracing Chinese experience from the 1100s to 1433 when it was the most dynamic force in Asian trade. China’s exposure to world trade had been greatly enhanced when the Sung dynasty were driven out of North China and relocated their capital at Hangchow, south of the Yangtse. It was a prosperous and densely populated region of rice cultivation. It was not necessary to bring food supplies from distant areas. They relied more heavily on commercial taxes than most Chinese dynasties and fostered the development of ports and foreign trade. Their major port was Ch’üan–chou, about 600 kilometres north of Canton. They developed large scale production of ceramics for the export market, and the kilns of Ching–te–chen (in Kiangsi) prospered greatly. In order to defend the Yangtse and coastal areas against Mongol attacks the first Chinese professional navy was created in 1232. Within a century it had grown to 20 squadrons with 52 000 men, with its main base near Shanghai. The ships included treadmill operated paddle–wheelers with protective armour plates, for service on the Yangtse. These were armed with powerful catapults to fling heavy stones or other missiles at enemy ships. The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 69 

After the Sung were defeated, the Mongol (Yuan) dynasty continued with even larger scale shipbuilding activities for foreign trade, for grain transport to Peking (their new capital) in North China, for maritime commerce with Asia and for naval operations. In 1274 and 1281, two massive fleets were assembled in an unsuccessful attempt to invade Japan. The first fleet included 900 ships, the second was much larger and carried an invasion force of quarter of a million soldiers. They reopened overland commerce to Europe and the Middle East on the silk route. As in the Sung, a large proportion of the trading community in the Yuan dynasty were from all parts of the Muslim world. This is clear from the observations of Marco Polo, the Venetian who came to China in the last quarter of the thirteenth century, and Ibn Battuta from Morocco more than 50 years later. Both left striking testimony to the vigour of the international trade of China at that time. In the early years of the Ming, the Yung–lo emperor embarked on a series of naval expeditions outside the area of the “Eastern Oceans” which were the traditional Chinese sphere of interest. These expeditions were massive exercises whose basic motivation was political, though they did include an important element of state trading. Yung–lo was a usurper, who had deposed his nephew in a successful military rebellion. The naval ventures were intended to display China’s power and wealth and enhance his own legitimacy. They were also intended to extend Chinese suzerainty over a much wider area. Korea was a permanent member of this system of tributary relationships and Yung–lo persuaded Japan to accept a similar status in 1404 (which lasted with a brief interruption until 1549). In the tribute system, there was an initial exchange of “gifts” (consisting on the Chinese side of specialties such as silk, gold, lacquer and porcelain) and the other side would reciprocate. These exchanges were renewed at intervals of a few years, and in the past had been followed up by private trade relations. However, Yung–lo prohibited private trade. Table 2–11.

These tributary relations were conceived as a vehicle for assertion of China’s moral and cultural superiority, to act as a civilising force on barbarians at the frontiers, and thereby enhance China’s security. For this reason the government expected to play a leading role in developing and supervising the trade relationships. The underlying idea was not to create a colonial empire, but to assert Chinese hegemony. This traditional view of Chinese relations with the outside world was very different from that of the Mongol dynasty whose objective was world conquest, and Yung–lo probably felt the need to re–establish a more attractive image of Chinese civilisation. Seven expeditions between 1405 and 1433 penetrated very deep into the “Western Oceans”. They were commanded by Admiral Cheng–ho, a member of the emperor’s household since he was 15 years old who had become a comrade in arms. Cheng–ho was a eunuch. There were thousands of them in the Ming imperial household. Emperors of this dynasty used them as a trusted and loyal counterweight to the power of the bureaucracy. Most of the latter regarded the expeditions as a waste of money, at a time when there were very large commitments in moving the Ming capital from Nanking to Peking and in rebuilding the Grand Canal. They involved very heavy fiscal burdens, and special levies on the coastal provinces. Yung–lo augmented his revenues by printing massive quantities of paper money. The resulting inflation (see Table 2–12) led to a disappearance of paper money transactions in the private economy. From the 1430s, silver became the predominant instrument of exchange and tax payments. Under the Yung–lo emperor, the Ming navy “consisted of some 3 800 ships in all, 1 350 patrol vessels and 1 350 combat ships attached to guard stations or island bases, a main fleet of 400 large warships stationed near Nanking and 400 grain transport freighters. In addition there were more than 250 long–distance Treasure–ships” (Needham, 1971, p. 484). The treasure ships were the most important vessels in the maritime expeditions to the Western Oceans. They were five times as big as any of the ships of da Gama, 120 metres long and nearly 50 metres broad. Chinese ships differed substantially from those in the Indian Ocean or Portugal. The treasure ships had nine masts, and smaller ships also had multiple masts. Transverse laths of bamboo attached to the sail fabric permitted precise and stepwise reefing. When sails were furled, they fell immediately into pleats. If tears developed in the sail, the area affected was restricted by the lathing. Big ships had 15 or more watertight compartments, so a partially damaged ship would not sink and could be repaired at sea. They had up to 60 cabins so the crew quarters were more comfortable than on Portuguese ships. Table 2–11 shows the characteristics of the six naval expeditions of the Yung–lo emperor, and the seventh which was sent after his death. The fleets were very large and the big ships were intended to overawe the rulers of the countries which were visited. The intentions were peaceful but the military force was big enough to deal effectively with attacks on the fleet, which occurred on only three occasions. The first had India and its spices as their destination. The rest explored the East Coast of Africa, the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. Table 2–12.

A major purpose of these voyages was to establish good relations by presentation of gifts and to escort ambassadors or rulers to or from China. There was no attempt to establish bases for trade or for military objectives. There was a search for new plants for medical purposes, and one of the missions was accompanied by 180 medical personnel. There was also an interest in types of African livestock which were unknown in China. The expeditions brought back ostriches, giraffes, zebras, elephant tusks and rhinoceros horns. However, these were exotica, and there was no significant replication of the international interchange of flora and fauna which the European encounter with the Americas inaugurated. After the death of Cheng–ho, support for this distant diplomacy faded very quickly. The broadening of China’s tributary relations with countries of the “Western Oceans” did not enhance China’s security and the cost of the naval expeditions had exacerbated a situation of fiscal and monetary crisis. The meritocratic bureaucracy had always opposed a venture which promoted the leverage of the eunuch interest. They consolidated their gains by destroying the official records of the overseas expeditions. There was increasing concern to defend the new northern capital against potential invasions from Mongolia or Manchuria. The new capital’s food supply was guaranteed by the Grand Canal which had been reopened in its full length in 1415 (2 300 kilometres — equivalent to the distance from Paris to Istanbul). It functioned better than ever before because of new locks which made it operational on a full–time basis 25 . Grain shipments by sea to the capital had already ceased and sea–going grain ships were replaced by canal barges. As the oceanic diplomacy had been ended, there was no longer a need for Treasure ships, coastal defences had been reduced and there was strong pressure to reduce the hard core of the navy. By 1474 the fleet of large warships had been cut from 400 to 140. Most of the shipyards were closed, and naval manpower was reduced by retrenchment and desertions. The tributary arrangements for countries within the Eastern Ocean continued, e.g. ships from Japan were able to come at intervals of several years, but the Yung–lo ban on private trade continued, and sea–going junks with more than two masts were prohibited. This regime of interdiction and regulation eventually sparked large scale development of illicit private trade and piracy. The coastguards were open to bribery. By the time the Portuguese established their base in Macao in 1557, they were fully aware of the trading situation and had easy contacts with Chinese and Japanese pirates. In 1567, the Chinese authorities ended the prohibition on private trade but banned trade with Japan. This gave the Portuguese an unbelievably favourable window of opportunity. 

Japan 

In 1539, the Chinese had confiscated the cargo of Japanese ships participating in the tribute trade. In 1544 they had turned away Japanese attempts to renew the tributary trade. This was enough to induce Japanese hostility, and enmity was further heightened by political changes in Japan. By the middle of the sixteenth century the Ashikaga shogunate which had accepted nominal Chinese suzerainty was on its last legs. It was succeeded by a series of three ruthless military dictators, Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and Ieyasu, who created a powerful unified system of government. They completely repudiated the idea of Chinese suzerainty. These political developments occurred at the same time as Japan became a major silver producer. Rich deposits were discovered in the 1530s. The export potential was very large. The Chinese market was hungry for silver, and the gold/silver price ratio was much more favourable to silver in China than in Japan. As the Chinese would not allow Japanese ships to enter their harbours, the main carriers of Japanese silver to China were Chinese pirates and the Portuguese. The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 72 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

Portuguese ships were able to bring Indonesian spices from Malacca to Macao, sell them in China, buy Chinese silks and gold, go from Macao to harbours in the south of Japan (first Hirado and then Nagasaki), sell these products, buy Japanese silver, sell it in Macao, and buy silk again for shipment to Japan or their depot in Goa. Portuguese trade was also accompanied by Jesuit missions. Francis Xavier was in Japan in 1549– 51, and Jesuits were very successful in getting converts in the south of Japan. Eventually, the number of Japanese Christians rose to about 300 000 (many more converts than the Jesuits made in Goa or in China). Japanese were interested in Portuguese ships, maps and navigation, and learned something of these two techniques. They were even more interested in guns. Portuguese technology of that epoch was reproduced in Japanese namban (southern barbarian) art which is displayed most clearly in very large multi–panelled lacquer screens. The first Portuguese to arrive in 1543 had firearms which were new to Japan. The potential of this new weaponry was quickly appreciated by the military who managed to copy the guns and manufacture them in Japan. They had an important effect in deciding the outcome of the Japanese civil wars. After 1615, the new shogunate began a successful policy to eliminate firearms and restrict the use of swords to the samurai .In 1596, the Spanish authorities in Manila tried to replicate Portuguese successes in Japan, and sent a mission of Franciscan missionaries to proselytise. The Japanese got the impression that Spain might want to take over as they had the Philippines, and on Hideyoshi’s order the Spanish missionaries and 19 of their converts were crucified at Nagasaki. From that point on, Japan became increasingly hostile to Portuguese missionary activities, and made contact with English and Dutch traders who had no religious ambitions. Eventually Christianity became illegal, and the Portuguese were expelled in 1639. Henceforth trade with the Japanese mainland was confined to Chinese and Dutch traders. 

Manila 

Fernao de Magalhaes had participated in the first Portuguese expedition to the Moluccan spice islands in 1511, and was disappointed with his pay and prospects when he returned to Portugal. In 1517, he defected to Spain, changed his name to Magellan, and persuaded the Spanish crown to finance a voyage by a Western route. The expedition he commanded (1519–22) was the first to circumnavigate the globe. It established a route around the south of Argentina. Magellan was killed in combat in the Philippines, but the voyage continued to the spice islands and eventually got back to Spain. Fifteen men returned, more than 200 failed to survive the voyage. Spain surrendered its claim to the Moluccas to Portugal for a cash payment, but gained effective control of the Philippines in 1571. It was the only significant part of the Spanish empire outside the Americas. The route between Acapulco (on the west coast of Mexico) and Manila had a monopoly in trading Spanish silver against Chinese silks and porcelain. Spaniards took little direct part in China trade, which was mainly conducted by Chinese ships, using the large overseas Chinese population of Manila as intermediaries. At the end of the sixteenth century there were 2 000 Spanish living in Manila and 10 000 Chinese. Relations with China were never very friendly. In 1603, a visit by rather pushy Chinese traders representing the provincial authorities of Fukien gave the misleading impression that China intended to invade the Philippines. The Spanish reaction was to attack and kill most of the Chinese community in Manila. The Chinese Wan–li emperor executed the trader who had provoked the Spanish, and the trade with China managed to survive this incident. However, possession of the Philippines was never a particularly profitable venture for Spain, and the flow of silver from Mexico via Manila to China was a good deal smaller than that from Japan (see Table 2–9).

VII T HE P ORTUGUESE IN B RAZIL 

When the Portuguese arrived in Brazil in 1500, their situation as colonialists was very different from that of Spain in Mexico and Peru. They did not find an advanced civilisation with hoards of precious metals for plunder, or a social discipline and organisation geared to provide steady tribute which they could appropriate. Brazilian Indians were mainly hunter–gatherers, though some were moving towards agriculture using slash–and–burn techniques to cultivate manioc. Their technology and resources meant that they were thin on the ground. They had no towns, no domestic animals. They were stone age men and women, hunting game and fish, naked, illiterate and innumerate. In the first century of settlement, it became clear that it was difficult to use Indians as slave labour. They were not docile, had high mortality when exposed to Western diseases, could run away and hide rather easily. So Portugal turned to imported African slaves for manual labour. The ultimate fate of Brazilian Indians was rather like that of North American Indians. They were pushed beyond the fringe of colonial society. The main difference was greater miscegenation with the white invaders and with black slaves in Brazil. A much bigger proportion of Portuguese gains from Brazil came from development of commodity exports and commercial profit than those of Spain from its colonies. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries official revenue from Brazil was small — about 3 per cent of Portuguese public revenue in 1588 and 5 per cent in 1619 (see Bethell, 1984, Vol. I, p. 286). In the sixteenth century, economic activity was concentrated on a small population of settlers engaged in a highly profitable export– oriented sugar industry in the Northeast. The techniques for this industry, including negro slavery, had been previously developed in Madeira and São Tomé. Cattle ranching in the dry backlands area (the 

sertão ) provided food for those working in sugar production. Brazilian sugar exports peaked in the 1650s. Earnings fell thereafter because of lower prices and competition from the rapidly growing output in the Caribbean (see Table 2–4). The setback in sugar caused large parts of the Northeast to lapse into a subsistence economy. In the 1690s, the discovery of gold, and in the 1720s diamonds further south in Minas Gerais, opened new opportunities. During the eighteenth century, there was considerable immigration from Europe, and internal migration from the Northeast to Minas, to engage in gold and diamond development. The eighteenth century prosperity in Minas is obvious even today from the number of elaborate buildings and churches in Ouro Preto which was the centre of mining activity. As Minas Gerais is very barren, the food and transport needs of the mining area stimulated food production in neighbouring provinces to the South and in the Northeast, and mule–breeding in Rio Grande do Sul. The gold industry was at its peak around 1750, with production around 15 tons a year, but as the best deposits were exhausted, output and exports declined. In the first half of the eighteenth century profit remittances from gold averaged 5.23 million milreis (£1.4 million) a year, of which the identifiable royal revenues were around 18 per cent (Alden, 1973, p. 331). Total Brazilian gold shipments over the whole of the eighteenth century were between 800 and 850 tons (see Morineau, 1985). In the second half of the eighteenth century, Portuguese finances were in desperate straits. Metropolitan revenues from Brazil were squeezed by the decline in gold production. Income from Asia had collapsed and Portugal had to bear the costs of reconstructing Lisbon after the 1755 earthquake. To meet this problem, the Portuguese prime minister, Pombal, expelled the Jesuits from Brazil (1759), confiscated their vast properties, and sold them to wealthy landowners and merchants for the benefit of the crown. Most of the property of other religious orders was taken over a few years later. The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 74 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006

When gold production collapsed, Brazil turned back to agricultural exports. At independence in 1822, the three main exports were cotton, sugar and coffee. Coffee production started at the beginning of the nineteenth century after the slave revolt cut output in Haiti. Coffee was grown in the Southeast, whereas sugar and cotton were typical Northeast products. At the end of the colonial period, half the population were slaves. They were worked to death after a few years of service, and fed on a crude diet of beans and jerked beef. A privileged fraction of the white population enjoyed high incomes but the rest of the population (free blacks, mulattos, Indians and large numbers of the whites) were poor. Landownership was concentrated on slave owners, thus a very unequal distribution of property buttressed a highly unequal distribution of income. There was substantial regional inequality. The poorest area was the Northeast. Minas Gerais had also passed its peak. The most prosperous area was around the new capital, Rio de Janeiro. Independence came to Brazil very smoothly by Latin American standards. In 1808, the Portuguese Queen and the Regent fled to Rio to escape the French invasion of the motherland. They brought about 10 000 of the mainland establishment with them — the aristocracy, bureaucracy, and some of the military who set up government and court in Rio and Petropolis running Brazil and Portugal as a joint kingdom (both parts by then being about equal in terms of population). After the Napoleonic wars, the two countries split without too much enmity. Brazil became independent with an Emperor who was the son of the Portuguese monarch. With independence, Brazil ceased remitting official tribute to Portugal, but the large imperial ruling establishment meant a higher internal tax burden. The British, the new protectors of Brazil, took out their growing commercial profits. However, independence meant that the country could create its own banking system, print paper money, indulge in mild inflation and borrow on the international capital market. There was an intermittent inflow of foreign capital from the 1820s onwards, mostly in the form of direct loans to the government or the proceeds from sales of Brazilian government bonds abroad. There were 17 foreign loans in the Imperial period. There was no default on this debt, and Brazil remained in good standing with its British bankers who supplied all the funds. There were changes in commercial policy which came with independence. Until 1808, Brazilian ports were open only to British or Portuguese ships 26 , and mercantilist restrictions prevented production of manufactured items. These barriers were lifted in 1808, but the United Kingdom retained special extra–territorial rights and tariff preferences until 1827. The preferences were then abolished, but Brazil was obliged to limit tariffs to 15 per cent ad valorem until 1844. This was a serious fiscal constraint on a government with all the trappings of a monarchy to support, and without the political clout to impose land or income taxation. It encouraged the trend towards inflationary finance and a depreciating paper currency. In 1844, when Brazil regained its customs autonomy the general tariff level was raised to 30 per cent for manufactured goods, but duties on raw materials and machinery were lifted.

These measures stimulated the creation of the cotton spinning and weaving industry. In the Imperial period, tariff revenue provided two thirds of the government’s tax receipts and their effect in protecting local industry was significant. Tariff receipts were a higher proportion of imports than those of any other country except Portugal 27 .In 1833, the United Kingdom abolished slavery in the West Indies and started to interfere actively with the slave trade. Between 1840 and 1851, the inflow of slaves to Brazil was 370 000, but thereafter the British Navy brought it to an end. Slavery continued for almost four more decades, but the economy was modified significantly by the ending of the trade. The immediate effect was to double the price of slaves and make it less profitable to work them to an early death. The sex and age structure of the black population began to change, making for lowered activity rates. In 1888, slavery was abolished without compensation, or any kind of resettlement help for slaves. By that time the slave population was only 7 per cent of the total compared with 13 per cent in the United States in 1860, on the eve of the US civil war. The Emperor was deposed in 1889 by the military which established an oligarchic republic. Church and state were separated. The franchise was restricted to those with property. The Presidency generally alternated between politicians from São Paulo and Minas Gerais on a prearranged basis. The monarchy had exercised a centralised power, but now the provinces became states with a good deal of autonomy, including control over customs duties which could be levied on both foreign and interstate commerce. At the state level, power was concentrated in the hands of a small political class who favoured their cronies and relatives. At local level, “coronelismo” (rule of the colonels) prevailed. This semi–bandit gentry built up their landholdings by means not always legal, and exercised seigneurial type power over the less prosperous citizenry. In the initial years of the Republic, the strains involved in moving from slave to wage labour were obvious. Coffee was no longer profitable in the region around Rio, which switched to cattle raising. The competitive position of São Paulo was strengthened. Its climate and soils were better suited to coffee than the eroded valleys near Rio. It had been building a free labour force of white immigrants since the 1840s, when Senator Vergueiro introduced them to his plantation. The state government subsidised immigration (mainly of Italians) on a large scale from 1880 to 1928. In the 1920s, many of the immigrants to São Paulo were Japanese. This part of the country was further helped by the growth of rail transport and the development of the port of Santos. The average educational level of immigrants was considerably higher than that of native born Brazilians. They had twice the literacy rate and three times the level of secondary and higher education (Merrick and Graham (1979), p. 111). Their wage level made them more expensive than slaves, but their productivity was higher, and their number could be quickly expanded by immigration. The Northeastern economy stagnated in the Republican period. There and elsewhere, the black and mulatto population generally got little of the benefits of growth in a country where they had no voting rights, access to land, education or any form of governmental help in adjusting to a wage economy. Portuguese rule in Brazil had several lasting consequences: 

a) Brazil is characterised by very wide disparities in income, wealth, education and economic opportunity. These are more extreme than in Asia, Europe or North America. The social structure still has strong echoes of the colonial period, when there was great inequality in access to landed property, and the bulk of the labour force were slaves. The continued neglect of popular education is very marked even by Latin American standards and has hampered the growth of labour productivity. Another aspect of inequality is regional. The per capita income disparity between the poorest state, Piaui, and the federal district is about 7:1. The only other countries with this degree of regional disparity are Mexico and China.

b) Inequalities of income and opportunity in Brazil are closely associated with ethnicity, but the heritage of slavery has produced less social tension than in the United States. Gilberto Freyre (1959) argued that Brazilians are more or less colour blind, and that Brazil is a social continuum from rich to poor with no sharp social antagonisms. Brazil was different from the United States mainly because Portuguese society and mores at the time of colonisation were heavily influenced by close contact with the Muslim world. Florestan Fernandes (1969) took a much more critical view of a Brazilian society that practises de facto but generally discreet social discrimination. 

http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/723137538677 The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 77 

c) Brazil has been favoured by softer political transitions than other countries in Latin America. The Treaty of Tordesillas (1494) divided the Americas amicably between Portugal and Spain. Portugal got a slice extending 48 degrees West of the Greenwich meridian, but its present borders encompass nearly three times as much land — a situation peacefully endorsed by the Treaty of Madrid in 1750. Most of the territorial gains were made by frontiersmen. The only substantial invasion was the Dutch occupation of the Northeast (1630–54). Conflicts to preserve boundaries against French or Spanish incursions were insignificant, and the last territorial acquisition, the Acre territory, was by purchase from Bolivia. The biggest foreign war was with Paraguay (1865–70). This is in stark contrast with Mexico, which lost half its territory in wars with the United States, or to European and Asian experience of wars over boundaries. 

d) Another striking feature has been the ease of Brazil’s domestic political transitions. Independence was gained with no significant struggle, the Portuguese crown prince becoming Emperor of Brazil in 1822. Slavery was abolished without a civil war in 1888. The Empire became a republic without a struggle in 1889. The Vargas dictatorship of 1930–45 began and ended with relatively little violence, and this was also true of military rule from 1964–85. 

e) The combination of smooth political transitions, freedom from foreign conflicts and relative ease of social relations between ethnic groups permitted Brazil to assimilate a cosmopolitan mix of the original Portuguese settlers, the descendants of African slaves, later immigrants from Italy, Japan, Germany and the Lebanon. It is a frontier country with a high degree of self–confidence, without a chip–on–the– shoulder feeling of exploitation by powerful neighbours. It is a looser federation than many big countries and has an intellectual life which is multipolar. 

VIII T HE N ETHERLANDS 

From 1400 to 1700, Dutch per capita income growth was the fastest in Europe, and from 1600 to the 1820s its level was the highest. Before 1600 this performance was due to seizure of opportunities for trade in Northern Europe, and success in transforming agriculture by hydraulic engineering. Thereafter prosperity was augmented by its role in world trade. The Dutch Republic became independent in 1579 by breaking away from a larger “Netherlands” ruled by Spain 28 . The struggle to achieve and maintain independence lasted for nearly 80 years. The Dutch defeated a Spanish empire which included Castile, Aragon, Portugal (from 1580 to 1640), Naples, Sicily, the Duchy of Milan, Franche Comté, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, West Indies, Tunis, Flanders, Brabant, Luxembourg, Lille, Artois and Hainault. It is useful to consider the economic and political context from which the Netherlands economy emerged. From the twelfth century onwards, Flanders and Brabant were the most prosperous part of Northern Europe. The leading cities of Flanders (Bruges, Ghent and Ypres) were the major centre of the European woollen textile industry, making very high quality draperies, tapestries and furnishing materials, which were sold all over Europe. The raw materials were to a substantial extent supplied by imports — wool from England and alum (a cleansing agent indispensable in the cloth industry) which Genoese traders brought from Chios. Woad and other dyestuffs, fuller’s earth and other items were mainly local products. In the middle of the fourteenth century (see Postan, 1987, p. 180), English wool exports were running at nearly 7 000 tons a year, most going to Flanders via the English port of Calais. By the middle of the fifteenth, English wool exports had dropped by four fifths and the wool imports of Flanders came from Spain, being shipped from Bilbao and other Spanish Atlantic ports. England had become an exporter rather than an importer of woollen textiles, but a substantial part of its cloth exports were undyed and sent to Flanders for finishing. McNeill (1974) pp. 53–4 indicates the The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 78 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

magnitude of the massive Genoese alum shipments to Flanders between the mid–fourteenth to mid– sixteenth century: “Having captured Chios in 1346, they used the island as an entrepôt, collecting the yield of all the mines of Asia Minor there. This assured a constant supply of adequate quantities of alum to fill the holds of vast specialised ships — some twenty such vessels, of a size greater than any wooden ship attained before or afterward, plied regularly between Chios and Bruges, winter and summer, stopping en route only at Cadiz to take on water and other supplies.” Postan suggests that the annual production of Flemish woollen cloth in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was more than 150 000 pieces of 28 yards (25.8 metres) in length. In addition Flanders produced linens for export, using local supplies of flax. Flanders was heavily urbanised and much of its food was imported. There were substantial imports of grain (wheat and barley from France and England, rye from the Baltic), fish from the Baltic and Holland, and wine from France. Postan suggests that wine exports from Bordeaux were running at 25 million gallons a year at the beginning of the fourteenth century. A large proportion of this went to England, some to the Baltic, and a substantial amount to Flanders and Brabant. By the mid–fourteenth century, the cities of Brabant (Antwerp, Leuven and Brussels) gained an economic edge on Flanders, due to the silting up of water routes to Bruges, the greater enterprise of Antwerp and British competition with the Flemish woollen industry. In Flanders, output, marketing and production practices tended to be heavily regulated by guilds. Foreign trade was conducted through periodic fairs or “staple” arrangements which confined international transactions to particular towns and gave privileged access to the consortium of German merchants in the Hanseatic League. Antwerp had a magnificent harbour at the mouth of the Scheldt, and a more commercial, less regulatory approach. It was the major North European centre for international banking, and loans to foreign rulers, e.g. Henry VIII of England. The Antwerp bourse provided a model for the London Exchange. Both Flanders and Brabant conducted a substantial amount of international business in their high value exports by land, but for heavy imported goods, sea transport was very much cheaper. A large part of these imports came by sea and river in ships and boats from Holland, Zeeland and the Northern Provinces. The seven Northern Provinces which united to create the Dutch Republic (Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Gelderland, Overijssel, Friesland and Groningen successively in 1579–80) were very different from Flanders and Brabant 29 . They occupied a flat amphibious terrain where the relationship between land and water was very close. There were major natural waterways. The Rhine provided transport deep into Germany, to Cologne and Frankfurt–am–Main. Its delta was full of islands and natural harbours. The Ijssel led into the Zuider Zee, the Ems provided an excellent route to the North German coast. In such a setting, the leading industries were fisheries, sea and river transportation and shipbuilding. Agriculture was also deeply marked by the possibilities for hydraulic management and irrigation. In the fourteenth century, the merchant marine of the Northern Provinces had established a major position in the North Sea and Baltic, carrying rye and timber from East Germany and Poland which was shipped via Danzig; furs, wax, honey, pitch, tar and timber from Russia via Narva and Riga; copper, iron ore, weapons and salt herring from Sweden; salted cod and timber from Bergen in Norway. In return they carried re–exports of English woollen textiles, salt (for preserving fish and meat) and re– exports of wine from France. Apart from these merchanting activities, they acted as carriers, e.g. between Danzig and Riga, when opportunities arose. Shipping and trade in the Baltic had previously been monopolised by a consortium of German merchants (the Hanseatic League) with headquarters in Lübeck, and commercial bases in London, Bruges, etc. Hanseatic trade from the Baltic had relied to a large extent on the short land route from Lübeck to Hamburg. The Dutch pioneered the sea route through the Danish sound, which though longer, was cheaper. In 1437–41 the Hanseatic League engaged in hostilities to try to drive Dutch ships from the Baltic, but, with support from Danzig, the Dutch kept the right to trade. This trade was well The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 79

documented, because Denmark, whose territory then included Southern Sweden, controlled the entry to the Baltic and levied tolls. In 1500, 300–400 Dutch ships a year entered the Baltic, and by the 1560s, more than 1 300. Grain shipments amounted to about 100 000 tons a year in the latter period. The Dutch ships involved in this trade operated from the coasts of Zeeland, Holland and Friesland. Dordrecht was the major port for traffic on the Rhine with Germany and with Liège via the Meuse. Middelburg (on the island of Walcheren), opposite the mouth of the Scheldt, imported English woollen cloth, French wine, grains and salt, and in the sixteenth century, spices and sugar from Portugal. The Dutch trading fleet was by far the biggest in Europe. By the 1560s, on the eve of independence, the province of Holland alone had 1 800 seagoing ships (Israel, 1995, p. 117). The carrying capacity of Dutch merchant shipping in 1570 was about the same as the combined fleets of France, Germany and England (see Table 2–15). Per head of population, Dutch shipping capacity was 25 times as big as in these three northern countries. Herring fisheries were an important part of Dutch shipping activity. The herring were sold fresh or lightly salted near to the ports or were processed and barrelled for international trade. Before 1400, herring shoals best suited for salting were off the Swedish coast, but in the fifteenth century, they migrated into the North Sea, so the bulk of the catch was taken by Dutch ships. A technological breakthrough increased productivity substantially. Dutch shipyards developed a new type of factory ship (a herring “buss”), with nets, rigging and processing facilities which permitted crews of 18 to 30 men to gut, clean, salt and barrel the herring whilst at sea. Vessels of this type could make three trips a year of five to eight weeks during the open season from June to December. By the 1560s there were 400 Dutch vessels of this type operating from the province of Holland, with ownership concentrated on urban investors. At this time, the Dutch were exporting herring to the Baltic rather than importing (see de Vries and van der Woude, 1997, pp. 243–54). In the seventeenth century, Dutch ships embarked on whale fishing off Spitzbergen in the Arctic. Water control played a major role in Dutch agricultural development. Marshes, bogs, low–lying land subject to frequent flooding were not attractive in their natural state. Agricultural settlers in the Middle Ages occupied mounds and turned them into polders by building dykes to keep off flood waters. In time, skills in hydraulic management improved, and large areas of new land were reclaimed. By the beginning of the sixteenth century, water management and engineering was entrusted to professionals responsible for development and maintenance. Farming communities raised taxes and provided funds for the waterboards. Windmills were used as a source of power for pumps which controlled water flow in canals. As de Vries (1974) p. 27 noted: “Much of fourteenth century Holland was, in effect, a new country. Only in east–Elbian Germany can one find reclamation being carried out in so systematic a manner and over such large tracts.” This conquest of nature had important social implications. Only a small part of the Dutch population was constrained by feudal restrictions. Peasants were freer than anywhere else in Europe. Some were landowners, many more paid money rents or worked for wages. The reliance on water control generated solidaristic attitudes which are still observable in Dutch society. Dutch agriculture developed a high degree of specialisation. Much of the grain supply came from imports, and domestic production concentrated heavily on meat, milk, butter and cheese. Two features were more developed than elsewhere in Europe: a) stall feeding of cattle through the winter months, and b) large production of vegetables. Over time there was an increased emphasis on industrial crops — hops for the beer industry, flax, hemp and madder for textiles, and later, tobacco and tulip bulbs. There was a gradual transformation of agriculture into horticulture. In large areas of the Northern Netherlands there were layers of peat several metres deep which were a potential source of cheap energy for many purposes. After 1600, about 275 000 hectares of these peat–bogs were stripped. Engineering skills in land reclamation, drainage, and pumping were easily transferable to peat extraction. In the Groningen area, urban investors set up companies to exploit this resource on a large scale on confiscated monastic lands. The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 81 

Transport of peat, hay, wheat, cattle, timber, building materials and other heavy freight became a good deal cheaper in the middle of the seventeenth century, because of the creation of a network of canals equipped with tow–paths. Drawn by horses, canal barges carried freight, mail and passengers on regular schedules, at seven kilometres an hour, day and night, at frequent intervals between virtually all areas of the country. “In the 1660s, nearly 300 000 passengers travelled annually on the Amsterdam– Haarlem route, 140 000 glided between Haarlem and Leiden, and some 200 000 between Leiden and the joint destinations of the Hague and Delft” (de Vries and van der Woude, 1997, p. 187). No other country had such a cheap and dense transport network. Road freight carried by carts was slower and much more expensive. As Sir William Temple (1693), p. 152 put it: “one Horse shall draw in a Boat more than fifty can by Cart — And by this easie way of Travelling, an industrious Man loses no time from his Business, for he Writes, or eats, or Sleeps, while he goes.” The biggest industries in the Dutch provinces at the time of independence were shipbuilding, sailcloth, fishing nets, ropes, barrels and associated items, salt refining, breweries, brickworks and timber for buildings, and a substantial woollen and linen textile industry. The circumstances under which the partition of the Netherlands occurred had an enormous positive impact on the economic potential of the new republic. They were also detrimental to the economic interests of Portugal, Spain and the Spanish Netherlands. The struggle against the Spanish regime had involved repression and resistance in the Southern Netherlands as well as the North. The inquisition started in 1523 with the burning of two dissident clergy at the stake in Brussels. In the next 50 years more than 2 000 had met the same fate and a large proportion were from the South. The Count of Egmont, the governor of Flanders, a catholic who had been a distinguished general in the Spanish armies, was executed in 1567 because he had protested against Spanish fiscal demands and curtailment of previous political rights of the Southern nobility. Malines (Mechelen) was sacked by Spanish troops and part of its population massacred in 1572. Antwerp suffered deaths and serious property damage from the depredations of riotous Spanish soldiers in 1576. Its losses were even greater during the Spanish siege in 1583–85. As a result, there was large scale migration from Flanders and Brabant to the new republic. Between 1583 and 1589 the population of Antwerp fell from 84 000 to 42 000. In Bruges and Ghent the exodus of refugees reached the same proportions. In Mechelen, the population fell by two thirds. In the Republic, the population of Middelburg trebled, in Leiden it doubled, 30 000 came to Amsterdam (see Israel, 1995, pp. 307–12). Altogether, the influx was about 150 000, more than 10 per cent of the population of the South, and a bigger proportionate addition to the North. As the North had huge imports of grain and fish which no longer went to the South, there was no problem feeding the new population. The northern confiscation of monastic properties helped in accommodating the influx. The refugees included a large proportion of the merchant class and bankers of the Southern Netherlands (though some of the latter went to Germany). They brought capital, skills and international contacts. Virtually all of the Jewish population moved to the North. Migration of skilled workers strengthened the textile industry of Leiden. Immigrants also brought skills for other industries including printing, publishing and sugar refining. Before the partition, the only university had been in Leuven (founded 1425). This was one of the largest and most distinguished in Europe, but its freedom was curtailed by the inquisition. The university of Leiden was founded in the North in 1575 followed by Franeker (1585), Harderwijk (1600), Groningen (1614) and Utrecht (1634). Leiden was the biggest with a full range of faculties and offered a humanist education in the tradition of Erasmus. It soon began to attract a large international student body from Germany, Britain and Scandinavia, as well as the refugees from the South. The political change opened possibilities for a worldwide expansion in Dutch shipping activity to the detriment of Portugal and Spain. In the 1590s, trade with Asia was inaugurated with trial voyages around the Cape into the Indian Ocean to the spice islands, and West via the Magellan Straits to Japan. Barents, 1596–7, made an unsuccessful attempt at a Northeastern passage via Archangel and Novaya The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 82 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

Zemlaya. Hudson discovered New York in 1609 whilst seeking a Northwest passage. Within 30 years the Dutch displaced the Portuguese as the dominant European traders with Asia. They seized Portuguese bases in West Africa, acquiring a substantial share of the trade in gold and slaves. They attacked the Spanish empire in the Americas, occupying Northeast Brazil and its profitable sugar industry from 1630 to 1654 (at that time Portugal was ruled by Spain), then moved their base to the Caribbean (Curaçao and Surinam). There was also significant pirate activity. The greatest coup was Piet Heijn’s capture of the whole Spanish silver fleet off Cuba in 1628. From 1585 to 1795, for reasons of military and naval security and commercial advantage, the Dutch successfully blockaded the mouth of the Scheldt, consolidated the ruin of Antwerp, and imposed a very serious constraint on the economic progress of the Spanish Netherlands. In the course of the seventeenth century, Spanish military potential weakened enormously, but the Dutch had no interest in conquering the Southern Netherlands, which was a useful buffer against French territorial ambitions. Throughout the seventeenth and for most of the eighteenth century, British economists recognised the superiority of Dutch performance and policy. William Petty’s pioneering work on Political Arithmetick , written in 1676 and published in 1690 was perhaps the most astute assessment. He demonstrated that a “small country and few people may be equivalent in wealth and strength to a far greater people and territory.” He provided a foretaste of the type of reasoning used later by Adam Smith and Douglass North when he compared the performance of France and Holland. The population of France was more than ten times that of the United Provinces, but he estimated the Dutch merchant fleet to be nine times as big as the French, its foreign trade four times as big, its interest rate about half the French level, its foreign assets large, those of France negligible. The Dutch economy was highly specialised, importing a large part of its food, hiring mercenaries to fight its wars, and concentrating its labour force in high productivity sectors. Its flat terrain permitted substantial use of wind power. High density of urban settlement, good ports and internal waterways reduced transport and infastructure costs, cheapened government services and reduced the need for inventories. Dutch institutions favoured economic growth. Religious tolerance encouraged skilled immigration. Property rights were clear and transfers facilitated by maintenance of cadastral registers. An efficient legal system and sound banking favoured economic enterprise. Taxes were high but levied on expenditure rather than income. This encouraged savings, frugality and hard work. Thus the Dutch were a model of economic efficiency with obvious lessons for British policy. In a similar vein, Gregory King (1696) made a comparative assessment of the resource mobilisation of England, France and the Netherlands in fighting the war of the League of Augsburg. For the nine year conflict, William III, the Dutch stadholder who had become King of England, organised a coalition of the United Kingdom, Netherlands, the German protestant states, Spain and Savoy against France, which had challenged the legitimacy of his succession to the English throne and annoyed its neighbours by trying to expand its frontiers. King estimated French and English per capita fiscal revenues in 1695 to be similar, but in the Netherlands the level was more than two and a half times as large. The cost of maintaining Dutch independence was high, involving the creation of a chain of fortresses in the South and on the East (where the country was vulnerable from attack via catholic states in Germany — particularly the bishopric of Munster). Its army and naval expenditures were costly. It had to build up an armaments industry. It was involved in a series of wars in which England and France became the main enemies in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Towards the end of the seventeenth century Dutch economic expansion faltered. The Netherlands became the victim rather than the beneficiary of the beggar–your–neighbour policies of the merchant capitalist era. British and French shipping, trade and industry grew much faster than those of the Netherlands. Both countries adopted protectionist policies which damaged Dutch interests. The most important were the British Navigation Acts and similar French provisions. From 1651 onwards Dutch shipping and Dutch ship exports had restricted access to the ports of the United Kingdom and were barred from trade with English and French colonies. When these countries waged war with the Netherlands they did so with the concentrated energy of modern nation states — very different from the way Spain had dissipated its energy.

The main reason for loss of dynamism in the eighteenth century was the destruction of monopolistic trading privileges in conflicts with France and the United Kingdom, which pushed the Dutch to the sidelines. Population growth slackened as the economy ceased to attract migrants. There was stagnation in the industrialised western Netherlands and substantial growth in the agricultural province of Overijssel. Agricultural output increased, with a fall in imports and a growth in agricultural exports. There was a decline in production and exports of textiles (particularly the Leiden woollen industry), fisheries and shipbuilding. The volume of foreign trade dropped 20 per cent from 1720 to 1820. During this period UK exports rose more than sevenfold in volume, and French by two and threequarters. Dutch service industries continued to play an important part in the economy, and there was a large increase in overseas investment. In 1790 total foreign investment probably amounted to 800 million guilders at a time when national income was around 440 million. If the rate of return on foreign investment was around 4 per cent, then foreign income would have been around 30 million guilders, giving a national income about 8 per cent higher than domestic product. The combination of rising rentier incomes, together with pauperism and unemployment in the old industrial areas, increased inequality. 

Dutch Economic Activity Outside Europe a) Africa 

Dutch objectives in Africa were to get access to the gold of the Guinea coast, enter the slave trade to the Americas, and acquire a base for ventures in Asia. They succeeded in capturing Elmina in 1637 and several other Portuguese bases in West Africa for trade in gold and slaves. For a time they captured a foothold in Angola (the main slave base for the Portuguese) but failed to keep it. They also failed to take Mozambique (in East Africa). They established a new base at the Cape in South Africa, introducing European settlers to provide a staging and supply post for their voyages to Asia. The major economic gain came from participation in the slave trade. Slaves were shipped to Northeastern Brazil and to Surinam for Dutch sugar plantations, and to Curaçao for sale to British and French sugar planters. However, the Dutch role in the trade was a good deal smaller than that of Portugal, England and France (see Table 2–5). 

b) Americas 

In the Americas, the first major venture was the capture of the sugar producing region of Northeast Brazil (around Recife) from 1630 to 1654. Sugar was transported to the Netherlands where there were 40 refineries by 1650. The venture in Brazil had substantial military and naval support but the sugar plantations were run by private enterprise. Most were owned by sephardic jews from Amsterdam, many of Portuguese origin. During the period when Portugal was governed by Spain, the Dutch were reasonably well received in Brazil, but after Portugal regained its independence, they were expelled. Many plantation owners then moved to the Caribbean where they introduced the same production techniques and marketing patterns. Their arrival transformed the economy of Barbados which the British had occupied The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 85 

in 1627 and grew tobacco with white settlers. Within a short time the island had 30 000 slaves and was totally devoted to sugar (see Eltis, 1995, for a proxy assessment of the GDP of Barbados in 1644–1701). Emigrant plantation owners from Brazil had a similar impact in Guadeloupe and Martinique which had been French since 1635 (see Verlinden, 1972, p. 642–4). By the 1660s and 1670s, the British and French had driven out the Dutch, who moved their sugar activities to Surinam. In the early seventeenth century, sugar production in the Americas had been concentrated on Brazil. But from mid–century, Brazilian production stagnated and a hugely expanded market was dominated by France and Britain. Dutch production in Surinam was on a much smaller scale (see Table 2–4). Another Dutch venture in the Americas was the inadvertent discovery of a magnificent harbour and huge river by Henry Hudson. He was on a Dutch East India Company mission to try to discover a Northwest passage to Asia in 1609 and hopelessly off course. In 1614 the New Netherlands Company was founded to settle a colony with its capital at New Amsterdam in 1623. In 1664 it was taken over by the British, and in 1674 formally ceded (as New York) in exchange for a free hand for Dutch sugar interests in Surinam (de Vries and van de Woude, 1997, pp. 397 and 467). 

c) Asia 

The most successful area of Dutch involvement outside Europe was in Asia. The Dutch were extremely well informed about Asian trading prospects, for many had worked on Portuguese ships. One of them, Jan Huygen van Linschoten, produced two travel journals in 1595 and 1596 with detailed maps, information on markets, winds and potential routes. In 1602, under official pressure, all Dutch merchants in this trade were compelled to join the United East India Company (VOC) which was given monopoly trading rights and authority to establish military outposts and negotiate with foreign rulers. The Company owned and built all its own ships. The comparative volume of Dutch trading activity in Asia can be seen in Table 2–6. In the seventeenth century they sent out nearly five times as many ships as the Portuguese, and in the eighteenth, 15 times as many. The average size of their ships was smaller than the Portuguese who were then using huge carracks of 1 000 tons, against 600 tons for the average Dutch ship. The English East India Company (EIC) was a more important competitor than the Portuguese. They entered the Asian trade at the same time as the Dutch. Their main bases were at two towns they created in India (Madras 1639, and Calcutta in the 1690s) and Bombay which was a wedding gift from Portugal to Charles II in 1661. EIC operations in the seventeenth century were about half the size of those of the VOC, and about two thirds in the eighteenth. The French entered the Asian trade with the Compagnie des Indes Orientales which Colbert created in 1664. They established a base at Pondicherry (on the Coromandel coast) in 1673. By the eighteenth century, a new French company, created in 1719, had become a very significant presence. Later participants were Danish and Swedish companies, and from 1715–32, the Ostend company operating from the new port which the Austrian administration had created in the Southern Netherlands. The total volume of European shipping in Asia in the eighteenth century was about nine times as big as it had been in the sixteenth, but the scope for traditional exports of pepper and spices was limited. This meant that the Dutch, who were more heavily involved in this trade than the English and French and other newcomers, had to be careful to control supply in order to maintain prices. The opportunities for new exports to Europe — a wide variety of cotton textiles, coffee and tea — were much more promising and their share of the trade rose rapidly, for all of the participants in the market (see Table 2–20).

The initial thrust of the VOC was to bypass the Portuguese, using a new route via the Cape and sailing direct to Indonesia. This brought them directly to the Moluccan islands where the most valuable spices (cloves, nutmeg and mace) could be found. They were also able to get pepper in Indonesia, rather than India. The indigenous rulers in the Indonesian islands were much weaker than those in India, Persia, China and Japan, and more susceptible to Dutch pressure to enforce monopoly rights and low prices. The VOC established its headquarters in 1621 on the Javanese coast at Batavia (present– day Jakarta). They drove the Portuguese out of Ternate in 1603, and destroyed their base at Malacca in 1641. They also expelled the muslim merchants who had previously traded on the Javanese coast. The population of the spice islands revolted in 1621. They were all killed or deported and replaced by Dutch planters working with slave labour. In order to help finance its Indonesian operations, the VOC established a base at Masulipatnam on the East (Coromandel) coast of India. Here it obtained the agreement of the King of Golconda, who granted preferential trading conditions. The company’s main interest was in cotton textiles, in particular painted chintz, which were in demand in Indonesia. Later the VOC moved further down the coast and shifted their base to Negapatam in 1690 where textiles were cheaper.

In 1617, the VOC obtained permission from the Moghul empire to establish a base in Surat in Gujarat in Northwest India, dislodging Portuguese operations in this area. Here they could exchange pepper and spices for coarse cotton textiles for use as a barter item in the African slave trade. Later in the seventeenth century, the VOC tried to drive the Portuguese from their bases in Goa and Ceylon. It blockaded but did not capture Goa, but took Jaffna in Ceylon, replaced the Portuguese in the cinnamon trade and as rulers of the island. Portuguese trading on the Malabar coast was harassed, but that area did not have substantial commercial interest for the Dutch. There was an early move to establish trading links with China and Japan which had been so lucrative for Portugal. Unlike the Portuguese, The Dutch felt no vocation for religious evangelism, and were the only Europeans allowed to trade in Japan between 1639 and 1853. From 1641 they were confined to a very small island (Deshima) in the harbour of Nagasaki. The profitability of this trade faded after a few decades because of a Japanese ban on export of precious metals and Japanese insistence on fixing the prices at which the Dutch could sell their goods. In this trade there was no question of Dutch exploitation. In fact they were used as a conduit by Japanese eager to know about Western technology (see Appendix B). The VOC did not succeed in dislodging the Portuguese from Macao. In the 1620s they got a base in the Pescadores and from 1624 were allowed to shift to Taiwan. In 1662 they were forced to leave and never acquired another Chinese base. From the 1640s to 1660s the Ming dynasty was in a state of collapse. The great porcelain and pottery town of Ching–te–Chen was devastated and Chinese porcelain exports were interrupted until the 1680s. This encouraged the Dutch to develop their own pottery industry in Delft to produce cheap copies of Chinese blue–and–white ware. At the same time, the Japanese developed their own pottery and porcelain industry to substitute for Chinese imports, and the Dutch also copied Japanese copies of Chinese pottery. European production of porcelain in Sèvres and Meissen started later. The VOC operated from the 1630s in Bengal because of its rich variety of high quality textiles (cotton and silk). Here they stepped in the shoes of the Portuguese who had been expelled from Hugli by the Moghul authorities in 1632. At first the VOC concentrated on exporting Bengali raw silk and mixed cotton–silk textiles to Japan, and opium to Indonesia. In exchange they sold Japanese copper, silver and gold in Bengal. The Japanese market declined considerably after 1680, but European demand for Bengali textiles rose very rapidly. Between 1680 and 1740, textiles from Bengal were the largest component of VOC exports to the Netherlands (see Prakash, 1998, pp. 198 and 218). Fine cottons, muslins, silks and mixed piece goods appealed to new European tastes and rising incomes, though it was more difficult to know what the market might be for these fashion items than for raw silk or opium. Bengali textiles were also of major interest to the British and French companies from the last quarter of the seventeenth century, and their textile exports were even bigger than those of the Dutch. However, both the French (1686) and the British (1700) forbade import of printed and painted cottons in order to protect their domestic textile producers. Both countries continued to import these goods for re–export (though a large part of these were smuggled back into England). The Dutch did not protect their own textile industry, and ended up marketing a large part of French and somewhat less of the British re–exports of Indian textiles within Europe (see Table 2–19). The British greatly increased imports of white bleached cloth from Bengal for processing in England (see Rothermund, 1999). Towards the second half of the seventeenth century, European demand for coffee grew very fast. The first London café was opened in 1652. The beverage became popular in France in the 1660s and in the Netherlands in the 1670s. The VOC began buying coffee in Mokka in Yemen at the beginning of the eighteenth century, rising from 300 tons in 1711 to 875 tons in 1720. Shrubs were taken for planting in Java and by the late 1720s, Javanese production was about 2 000 tons a year. The VOC imposed The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 88 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

cultivation quotas on petty Javanese rulers who compelled their subjects to raise coffee. From the 1730s there was competition from Surinam where output and exports rose much faster (see Bulbeck and Associates, 1998). A few years later there was a great surge in European demand for tea, particularly in England and the Netherlands. The Chinese had opened Canton to foreign traders in 1685. British tea imports rose from about 100 kilos in 1669 to 28 000 tons in 1760 (see Chaudhuri, 1978, p. 539). The Dutch bought most of their tea from Chinese junks trading to Batavia, though there was a direct shipment from Canton to Amsterdam in 1729. The English company were able to finance their tea purchases in Canton by selling Bengali opium and raw cotton, but the Dutch were obliged to pay in bullion (see Glamann, 1981, pp. 212–43). The new European taste for coffee and tea was complementary to the rise of sugar consumption. Growth of these items displaced a significant part of demand for beer and gin, both in England and the Netherlands. In the second half of the eighteenth century, the VOC ceased to be a profitable organisation. It collapsed in bankruptcy in 1795, after several decades of distributing dividends bigger than its profits. One of the causes was the disintegration of the Moghul Empire in India and the British takeover of the governance of Bengal in 1757. After that, discrimination against Dutch operations weakened the VOC considerably. Anglo–Dutch hostilities in 1781–84 (when the two countries took opposite sides in the American War of Independence) had serious repercussions in Asia. The outbreak of the Napoleonic wars led to a complete British takeover of Dutch interests in India, Malacca, Ceylon, South Africa and temporarily in Indonesia. It also ended any significant French connection with India. Contributory factors to the profit decline were the very high overheads for the company in hiring military and naval personnel to run what had become a territorial empire in Java and Ceylon. The officers of the VOC were not well paid and conducted an increasingly large private trade in the company’s ships. There was also a good deal of corruption in the administration of Java and Ceylon, which benefited the servants but not the shareholders of the company. Given the changing commodity structure of trade and the locus of operations, Batavia was no longer an ideal headquarters. After 1815, Indonesia became a colony of the new Dutch kingdom. There was intensive development of tropical crop production for export. During the wartime period of British rule, there had been a policy of westernisation of the administration, property rights and land taxation. The Diponegoro revolt of 1825–30 ended this approach. Thereafter the Dutch stuck consistently to a policy of dual administration, retaining traditional rulers, law and custom as a major instrument of their rule. They also kept their trading monopoly, as most of the profits would have gone to powerful British and American traders under an open–trade regime. In the 1830s the so–called “Cultivation System” was introduced. The Netherlands exercised its claims on indigenous income by increasing its demand for tribute — forced deliveries of crops or labour services in lieu of land taxation. From 1816 to 1914 movement and residence of the indigenous and Chinese populations were controlled by a system of pass–laws designed to maintain labour discipline and enforce ethnic apartheid .From the 1830s, the Dutch were remarkably successful in raising the income flow from Indonesia. In the 1830–70 period, half of it went directly to the Dutch government as fiscal tribute from the cultivation system. In addition there was monopoly income from transport of export crops by the NHM shipping company owned by the Dutch King, and income from sales of monopoly franchises to dealers in opium. The government dominated production of sugar and coffee, but most of the tobacco crop was in private hands. Favoured individuals were subsidised to create sugar processing factories. There were ample opportunities for corruption in the Dutch administration, amongst the 76 local Regents and heads of the 34 000 villages of Java. In 1844 Indonesia was allocated a fictitious debt of 236 million guilders to cover the costs of liquidating the VOC’s debts and those incurred in suppressing the 1825–30 revolt.

Export prices for sugar and coffee rose after the abolition of the African slave trade in the 1830s. This ruined competitors in the Caribbean and raised costs in Brazil. From 1848, when the Netherlands acquired a more democratic political system, there was growing criticism of exploitative practices and bureaucratic cronyism in Indonesia. These pressures, plus the opening of the Suez Canal and the development of steam shipping, led the Dutch authorities to open the colony to private enterprise and investment. By the 1890s the government share of exports had dropped to zero. Table 2–21a provides a crude measure of the burden of colonial rule and the colonialist gain for the Netherlands for the period 1700 to 1930. The volume of exports grew very much faster after the demise of the VOC, and became a much greater share of Indonesian GDP. The proportionate gains to the Netherlands also rose greatly. Table 2–21b provides similar estimates for India, where the colonial burden and gain were relatively much smaller.

IX B RITAIN 

In considering British economic performance, it is useful to distinguish between Ireland and the rest of the kingdom. Wales was incorporated politically in 1301. The incorporation of Scotland did not take place until 1707, but the ground was prepared by the advent of a Scottish king to the English throne in 1603. Ireland was subject to a brutal conquest in the 1650s. Petty’s Anatomy of Ireland 

(1691) suggested that the population fell by a quarter because of war deaths, famine, plague and deportations. The war was followed by a massive confiscation of property and social restructuring. Two thirds of the land fit for agriculture was transferred from Irish to English landlords. Ireland had a per capita income half of that in the rest of the United Kingdom from 1700 to the 1850s (see Table B–13) and a very different demographic history. As a result of the famine of 1846–51 and massive emigration thereafter, Ireland’s population fell by half between 1840 and 1913. It therefore seems legitimate to treat Ireland as a British colony, as I have done in Table 2–22. Between the Norman conquest of 1066 and 1950 there were several major phases of British economic and political development and overseas involvement. 

The Norman–Angevin Regime, 1066–1485 

Between the years 1000 and 1500, British population growth was somewhat slower than the West European average, and in all probability this was also true of per capita income. The income level in 1500 (see Tables B–21 and 2–22) was well below that in Italy, Flanders and Brabant which were the European leaders at that time. From the eleventh to the mid–fifteenth century, British national identity was ambiguous. The monarchy and the ruling elite were Anglo–French warlords whose property rights and income derived initially from territorial conquests in England and France. The resources which the state could mobilise came from tribute received from feudal vassals and their servile peasantry. A fairly submissive church buttressed its political legitimacy and acted as an instrument of social control. William the Conqueror installed his friend Lanfranc as Archbishop of Canterbury, and Norman clergy to fill the other bishoprics. In 1170, when Henry II had problems with Archbishop Becket, he had him murdered. The main investments of the regime were fortified castles (such as those in Carnarvon and Harlech to consolidate the Welsh conquest) or imposing cathedrals and abbeys (such as the the Abbaye des Hommes — the tomb of the conqueror — and the Abbaye des Dames — the tomb of his wife — in Caen). The acquisition of land and loot in France was pursued by war and matrimony. British possessions were biggest in the second half of the twelfth century after Henry II married Eleonor of Aquitaine, the divorced wife of the French King Louis VII. At that time, half of France was British. There were British victories at Crecy in 1346, Poitiers 1356, and Agincourt in 1415. With Burgundian help the British captured and killed Joan of Arc in 1430. Thereafter the Burgundians changed sides, and at the end of the Hundred Years war in 1453, all that was left was Calais, which the French recuperated in 1558. There was some economic and political advance in this period. There was an extension of cultivated area by clearing of forests, and increases in land productivity because of changes in agricultural technology of the same kind as those elsewhere in Northern Europe (see White, 1962). There was a big expansion in wool production for export to Flanders, increasingly replaced from the second half of the fourteenth century by export of woollen cloth. However, a good deal of overseas trade was handled by foreign merchants and there was heavy dependence on Antwerp for banking and financial services. The level of urbanisation in 1500 was well below the West European average (see Table B–14). In England and Wales only 3 per cent of the population lived in towns of 10 000 and over compared with 21 per cent in Flanders and Brabant, 16 per cent in the Netherlands and 15 per cent in Italy.

The financial difficulties of the crown provoked a modicum of countervailing power in an emerging parliamentary process. There was some movement away from feudal property rights towards market forces in agriculture which was given a major push by the Black Death when plague reduced the population by a third, increased per capita land availability, and provoked claims for higher labour income. An important step was taken in the fourteenth century to establish English as the dominant language. Until then French had been used in all legal proceedings, which had a distinctly discriminatory impact on property rights. The situation was changed by the 1362 Statute of Pleading, which stated that “the French tongue is much unknown in the realm, so that the people who do implead, or be impleaded, in the king’s court, or in the courts of others, have no knowledge or understanding of that which is said for them or against them” (Baugh and Cable, 1993, p. 145).

Creation of a Modern Nation State and Institutions Favourable to Merchant Capitalism, 1485–1700 

From the end of the fifteenth to the end of the seventeenth century, British population rose about fourfold, compared with a doubling in the Netherlands, a rise of less than half in France, and about a quarter in Germany and Italy. There was an increase in life expectation (see Table 1–4), to a level substantially higher than in France. The agricultural share of the labour force dropped considerably (in 1700 it was 56 per cent). Apart from the rise in farm productivity, the reliability of the food supply had been increased (see Wrigley, 1988). This, together with the efficacy of coastal shipping in mitigating local food shortages had more or less eliminated famine–related mortality in England and Wales, at a time when it was still significant in France 30 . The urbanisation ratio rose more than fourfold (Table B–14) and London’s population 14–fold (it had become the biggest city in Europe, see Table 2–3). Per capita income in Britain almost doubled from 1500 to 1700, compared with a rise of a third in France and Germany and stagnation in Italy (see Table B–21). The only country where income grew faster and achieved a higher level by 1700 was the Netherlands. Dutch income performance was better because of higher productivity in agriculture, shipping, banking and commercial services, and a bigger degree of international specialisation. Its shipping fleet was bigger than that of Britain though it had less than a quarter of the population. Only 40 per cent of its labour force was in agriculture. British economists and diplomats of the seventeenth century (Petty, King, Davenant and Temple) regarded the Netherlands as the economic model to be emulated. To a large extent British economic institutions moved in a Dutch direction — a process which was consolidated in 1688 by the installation of a king who was also the Dutch Stadholder. There were several stages in the creation of a modern nation state which favoured the interests of merchant capitalism. The old feudal fragmentation of power and resources was replaced by a much more centralised system. Henry VII, a Welshman who emerged as victor in the civil war in 1485, confiscated the estates of many of the feudal aristocracy in favour of the ascendant gentry. He eliminated the right of the nobility to keep armed retainers. Thereafter their country houses were no longer fortified. His son, Henry VIII, broke with the Papacy, created a national church which practised a lukewarm version of protestantism, abolished the monastic orders and seized their property (including about a quarter of English land). His daughter Elizabeth dilapidated the property of the bishops. The great bulk of these ecclesiastical assets fell into the hands of a secular elite of merchants and gentry, through royal sales and largesse. In the seventeenth century, there were major changes in the British mode of governance (which involved the temporary establishment of a republic and abolition of the House of Lords). It ended with a monarchy dependent for its finance on a House of Commons controlled by a secular elite of landlords and merchants. In the field of economic policy there was a modernisation of the administration at the end of the seventeenth century. Professional competence was increasingly relevant in public appointments, and improved statistics were becoming a significant guide to policy. Patronage was still important, but political cronyism was replacing nepotism. The farmers of the hearth tax were obliged to show full accounts from 1679. Tax farming of customs duties was abolished in 1671 and an Inspector General of exports and imports was created in 1696. Tax farming of the excise was abolished in 1683, and the economist Davenant was appointed as the Commissioner. The Board of Trade was created in 1696, with John Locke, the philosopher, as one of the Commissioners. Samuel Pepys carried out a similar modernisation of the naval administration. In 1702, Gregory King, the economist, became Commissioner of Public Accounts. All of these new administrative posts were highly paid to ensure that the occupants were not corruptible. The Bank of England was created in 1694, and a major recoinage took place in 1696. Monetary policy was modernised and a properly managed market for public debt was emerging. The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 94 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

As a result, the British were able to develop a robust system of public finance in the eighteenth century in stark contrast to the weaknesses of the French regime. The government remained solvent with a large part of public debt in the form of perpetual annuities. There were no exemptions for privileged groups, no tax farmers, no sales of public office, no autonomous tax jurisdictions. The political legitimacy of taxes was guaranteed by parliamentary control and the number of public officials per head of population was a fraction of that in France 31 .Intellectual life was very vigorous and increasingly secular in the seventeenth century and there was close interaction with similar developments in Northern Europe. An organisational basis was created in Gresham College by the generous endowment in 1579 of Sir Thomas Gresham, an extremely wealthy banker and royal fiscal agent. The College provided open access to higher education in the form of daily lectures on different topics. It was particularly successful with applied mathematics and practical research into navigational instruments and shipbuilding. In the 1640s and 1650s it became a centre for intensive discussion of new results in experimental science, and was the precursor of the Royal Society which was founded in 1662 on its premises. The leading activists of the Society were Christopher Wren (professor of astronomy at Gresham and Oxford, and the architect who rebuilt London’s churches after the great fire); John Wilkins, mathematician and Warden of Wadham College; Robert Boyle, the chemist and anatomist; and William Petty, a former professor of anatomy in Oxford, creator of political economy, director of the cadastral survey of Ireland, and inventor of a double–bottomed ship (like a catamaran), speedier forms of land carriage, schemes for improving the postal service, water pumps and sweetening sea water. In this century of enlightenment, many distinguished intellectuals, e.g. Bacon, Hobbes, Locke and Newton, were involved in practical matters of public policy (Newton was Warden and later Master of the Mint from 1695 to his death). In many cases, their work had an important impact on technology. The restoration monarchy was interested in promoting research into practical and theoretical work on navigation, created the Royal Observatory and the post of Astronomer Royal. Edmund Halley, mathematician and astronomer, started his fruitful career at the age of 20, laying the foundations of stellar astronomy in the Southern hemisphere in two years of observation in St. Helena, and ended as Astronomer Royal. In 1693, he produced a fundamental paper on the mathematics of life expectation, using mortality data for Breslau supplied by Leibnitz. This laid the scientific foundation for life insurance. These scientific investigations in England had their counterpart in the Netherlands and to a significant extent in France, but were in sharp contrast with the situation in Spain where religious bigotry and the Inquisition inhibited intellectual curiosity. In Italy too, the counter–reformation harassed Galileo and weakened the creativity of a country which had shown such brilliance in earlier centuries. In terms of overseas commitments and foreign policy, there were major changes from the 1550s to 1700. The idea of European conquest was abandoned, and the strategic advantages of being an island were intelligently exploited. The British merchant fleet was greatly expanded. Naval forces were developed in the reign of Elizabeth which were adequate to beat off a Spanish attempt at invasion, and by 1700 had considerable offensive power. Gregory King estimated that in 1697 the merchant fleet comprised more than 2 000 vessels with a tonnage of 323 000 tons, and the navy had 189 vessels with a tonnage of 120 000 32 . This was bigger than any other power at that time (except the Netherlands, see Table 2–15). There was a relatively small British commitment to land forces (see Table 2–18b). From 1688 to 1815 Britain was involved in many wars with continental countries, but most of the burden of land warfare was borne by Britain’s allies. This division of effort was ensured by opportunistic diplomacy, subsidies, and the convenient persistence of enmities between major continental countries for dynastic, territorial or religious reasons. From the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, commercial policy was dominated by mercantilist assumptions. In England and in continental Europe, it was taken for granted that international competition was a beggar–your–neighbour proposition. A major reason for this was that economic advance before The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 95 

the nineteenth century was based on what seems in retrospect to have been a quite slow pace of advance in technology, with rates of domestic investment which by present standards were low. In England in 1688, Gregory King’s estimates suggest that the British investment rate was less than 7 per cent of GDP. The most promising opportunities for raising income were perceived to come from the increased specialisation and division of labour which the Dutch had achieved, or from exploiting new opportunities in the Americas, in the slave trade from Africa, and in imports of spices, textiles and porcelain from Asia. At the levels of income the Dutch and British had achieved there were funds available to finance these overseas ventures and corporate know–how to use them properly. Navigation and shipping technology permitted ventures which could be profitable even when the return voyage might last as much as two years in journeys to East Asia. Table 2–23.

UN Yearbook of International Trade Statistics (1996), p. 1065 for 1996. From Mitchell and Deane (1962), pp. 2679–84, it appears that reexports were 58 per cent of domestic exports (i.e. 37 per cent of total exports) in the 1720s and 1770s. This compares with 53 per cent and 220 per cent in the Netherlands for these two periods (see Table 2–19 above). In 1913, British reexports were 20.8 per cent of domestic exports, and in 1950, 3.9 per cent. In 1710, woollen and worsted yarn and manufactures were 78 per cent of domestic exports; in 1774, 49 per cent; in 1820, 12 per cent; and in 1913, 6 per cent. Cotton yarn and manufactures were 2 per cent of domestic exports in 1774; 62 per cent in 1820; 24 per cent in 1913; and 11 per cent in 1938.

Another attraction of such commerce was that it involved new products. In the sixteenth century sugar was virtually unknown as an item of popular consumption. By 1700, consumption was 2.6 kilos per head of population in England and Wales. For tobacco it had risen from zero to about 1 kilo. Tea and coffee had begun to make an appearance 33 . Printed and painted cotton textiles from India had brought major changes in taste and fashion. Porcelain and pottery from China had a similar impact on domestic utensils. The elasticity of demand for these new consumer goods was high, and this category of goods was a very large proportion of personal consumption. Gregory King’s estimates suggest that, in 1688, expenditure on food, drink and textiles in England and Wales was 58.5 per cent of gross domestic product (compared with about 16 per cent at the end of the 1990s).

There was an increasing frequency of wars to grab a bigger share of overseas opportunities. There were three Anglo–Dutch wars in the quarter century following 1652. They led to a significant constriction of Dutch trading opportunities in the Americas and Africa. There were also significant net additions to the British merchant fleet from capture of Dutch ships, particularly the Dutch “fluyts” which were designed for cheap mass production and reduced operating costs (through lower manning requirements) but were not armed 34 .Commercial policy reinforced the objective of these trade wars. There was a series of Navigation Acts, starting in 1651 and eventually repealed in 1849. These kept foreign ships from participation in trade with British colonies, and forced the colonies to route their exports through British ports. As a result, a pattern of trade developed which involved large imports of colonial goods for re–export. This pattern was also characteristic of Dutch and French trade (see Table 2–19 and the notes to Table 2–23). Table 2–23 shows clearly the switch in geographic orientation of British trade which had already started in the seventeenth century. 

The British Advance to Hegemony, 1700–1820 

Between 1700 and 1820, there was a marked acceleration in British population growth to a rate more than twice as fast as in the seventeenth century, when there were losses from civil war and plague. Growth was faster than in any other European country, and the urbanisation ratio rose substantially in all parts of the kingdom; again in sharp contrast to developments elsewhere in Europe (see Table B– 14). Per capita income growth was somewhat faster than in the seventeenth century, and more than twice as fast as the European average. By contrast, Dutch performance was disastrous. Its population growth decelerated sharply and per capita GDP fell. In 1700 British GDP (excluding Ireland) was twice as high as the Dutch. In 1820 it was seven times as big. There were significant changes in British economic structure, with a substantial decline in the share of the labour force in agriculture, and a big rise in industry and services (see Table 2–24). In the Netherlands there was deindustrialisation, deurbanisation, and a rise in the share of the farm sector. With the decline in domestic and overseas investment opportunities, Dutch savings were increasingly diverted to foreign investment, much of it in British public debt. Hence British growth was bolstered by Dutch finance (see Maddison, 1991 a, pp. 34–5 and 45–6). Between 1720 and 1820, the volume of British exports rose by 2 per cent a year, and Dutch fell at an annual rate of 0.2 per cent (see Maddison, 1982, p. 247). In 1700, the British share of world shipping capacity was little more than a fifth, the Dutch share more than a quarter. By 1820, the British share was over 40 per cent, and the Dutch little more than 2 per cent (see Tables 2–15 and 2–25a). This was the period when the United Kingdom rose to world commercial hegemony by adroit use of a beggar–your–neighbour strategy. The Dutch decline was due in substantial part to British and French commercial policy and to the disastrous impact of war in 1795–1815. From 1700–1820, Britain was involved in a series of major wars with different combinations of European powers (in 1700–13, 1739–48, 1756–63, 1793–1815) as well as the war of American independence (1776–83), which it fought alone against its colonies and their European allies (France, the Netherlands and Spain). British involvement in these conflicts was due in substantial degree to its pursuit of worldwide commercial supremacy. Britain made substantial gains in the peace treaties of 1713 and 1763. The latter eliminated the French from Canada and weakened the Spanish position in the Caribbean and Florida. The war of 1776–83 was a major defeat which involved the loss of the 13 British colonies in North America.

The revolutionary and Napoleonic wars were much less costly in real terms to Britain than to France, the Netherlands, Spain and other continental countries. The Napoleonic campaigns ranged from Moscow to Egypt, Northern Germany to Spain. On the French side more than half a million soldiers were killed, and at least as many in other countries. French troops were financed in substantial degree by levies or billeting soldiers at the cost of occupied territories. And there were swathes of devastation in Germany, Russia and Spain (see Kennedy, 1987, p. 115–39 on the costs of war). The war also involved commercial blockades which retarded industrial development on the continent (as analysed in Crouzet, 1964). There were huge setbacks to the overseas commercial and colonial interests of the continental powers. The Dutch lost all their Asian territories except Indonesia, and their base in South Africa. The French were reduced to a token colonial presence in Asia, and lost Saint–Domingue, their major asset in the Caribbean. Shortly after the war, Brazil established its independence from Portugal. Spain lost its huge colonial empire in Latin America, retaining only Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Philippines. Britain took over what the French and Dutch had lost in Asia and Africa, extended its control over India, and established a privileged commercial presence in Latin America. In 1750, the British Empire included about one and half million people in the Americas (see Table 2–28), about 2.4 million in Ireland, and bases in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. By 1820, although it had lost its 13 North American colonies, Britain had gained control of Indian territories with a population of about 100 million. British growth was reinforced from 1700 to 1820 by successful pursuit of its beggar–your–neighbour commercial strategy, but its advance was buttressed by other factors. Unlike its continental counterparts, its domestic development was not disturbed by armed conflict (as it had been in the seventeenth century). The integration of domestic markets was greatly improved by creation of a network of turnpike roads and canals and development of coastal shipping. This permitted a more efficient specialisation and division of labour between different regions. Resource allocation was further strengthened by sound public finance and the growth of the banking sector. From the 1760s, there was spectacular growth in the cotton textile industry. Demand for cotton clothing and household furnishings had been nurtured by a century and a half of imports from India. The prospects and profitability for domestic expansion were transformed by a wave of technological innovation. Cotton was much easier to manipulate mechanically than wool and mechanisation had a dramatic impact on labour productivity with modest levels of capital investment. Hargreaves’ spinning jenny (1764–7) permitted a 16–fold productivity gain in spinning soft weft. Arkwright’s spinning frame (1768) could produce a strong warp and used water power. Crompton’s 1779 “mule” could produce both weft and warp. Cartwright’s 1787 power loom extended the productivity gains to weaving; and, finally, the American Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin in 1793, which substantially reduced the cost of the raw cotton which was imported from America. Between 1774 and 1820, imports of raw cotton increased more than 20–fold. Employment in cotton textiles rose from a negligible level in the 1770s to more than 6 per cent of the labour force in 1820. Cotton yarn and manufactures rose from 2 per cent of British exports in 1774 to 62 per cent in 1820 (even though the price of these exports had fallen sharply). The share of woollen goods in exports fell from 49 per cent in 1774 to 12 per cent in the same period (see notes to Table 2–23). There was also an expansion in cotton textile production and knowledge of the new techniques in Europe, but French per capita consumption of cotton textiles in 1820 was only about a quarter of that in the United Kingdom. There were substantial improvements in navigational technology in the eighteenth century thanks to government support for the work of the royal astronomers, and the £20 000 prize offered for the development of a ship’s chronometer robust and accurate enough to establish longitude at sea. The first of a series of Naval Almanacs (practical guides to navigators) was published in 1767, and the final The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 99 

instalment of the prize money was paid for John Harrison’s chronometer in 1773. Armed with a replica of Harrison’s chronometer, and an array of other instruments developed in the eighteenth century, Captain James Cook was able to explore and map the coasts of Australia and New Zealand with great success. He did it without loss of any of his crew to scurvy. 

Acceleration of Technical Progress and Real Income Growth, 1820–1913 

Between 1820 and 1913, per capita income grew faster than at any time in the past — three times as fast as in 1700–1820. It was a new era for Britain and the rest of Western Europe. The basic reason for improved performance was the acceleration of technical progress, accompanied by rapid growth of the physical capital stock and improvement in the education and skills of the labour force. The efficiency of resource allocation benefited from an improved international division of labour, with Britain’s exports rising 3.9 per cent a year (almost twice as fast as the growth in GDP). Economic progress was facilitated by the absence of significant military conflicts. This contrasted sharply with experience from 1688 to 1815, when six major wars — 63 years of conflict — had put serious strains on economic development. Britain added to its territorial empire from 1820 to 1913. There were major acquisitions from the 1870s in Africa, which included Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria, Rhodesia, Sudan, Transvaal, the Orange Free State and Uganda. In Asia, Aden and the sheikdoms around Arabia, Burma, the Malay states, Hong Kong and some Pacific islands were added, and the British raj took control of the whole of India. The population in the African territories was about 52 million in 1913, in Asia about 330 million, in the Caribbean about 1.6 million, and in Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand about 18 million. The total population of the Empire was 412 million — ten times as big as Britain itself. The hard core of the Empire was India, with threequarters of its population. Indian taxation financed a large army under British control, which could be deployed to serve British objectives elsewhere in Asia, the Middle East and eventually in Europe. The security of the Empire was guaranteed by British naval supremacy and a network of military/naval bases in Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, Egypt, the Suez Canal, Aden and Hong Kong. In the course of the nineteenth century, there were major changes in British commercial policy. In 1846 protective duties on agricultural imports were removed and in 1849 the Navigation Acts were terminated. By 1860 all trade and tariff restrictions had been removed unilaterally. Dutch policy was similar to the British. In 1860 there were reciprocal arrangements for freer trade with France under the Cobden–Chevalier Treaty. The French made similar treaties with Belgium, Italy, Spain and Switzerland. These treaties had most–favoured nation clauses which meant that bilateral liberalisation applied equally to all countries. In the continental countries there was a reversal of this liberalisation later in the nineteenth century, but the United Kingdom stuck with free trade until 1931. Free trade was adopted in India and other British colonies, and the same was true in Britain’s informal empire. China, Persia, Thailand and Turkey were not colonies, but were obliged to maintain low tariffs by treaties which reduced their sovereignty in commercial matters, and granted extraterritorial rights to foreigners. In China, Britain took over the administration of its customs service, to ensure that China would service its debts. Although the British empire was run on a free trade basis from the middle of the nineteenth century, colonialism favoured British exports. In Asian and African countries, British shipping, banking and insurance interests enjoyed a de facto monopoly. The colonies were no longer run by monopoly trading companies, but by an imperial bureaucracy which was efficient and free of corruption, but it was rule by white men, living in segregated cantonments, frequenting British clubs, so there was an automatic discrimination in favour of British goods, and some quite overt discrimination in government purchasing policies.

Britain’s commercial policy and its willingness to import a large part of its food requirements had important positive effects on the world economy. They reinforced and diffused the impact of technical progress. The impact was biggest in the Western Offshoots which had rich natural resources to be exploited but there was also some positive effect in India which was the biggest and the poorest part of the Empire. The accelerated technical progress which characterised the world economy from the early nineteenth century onwards is often designated as an “industrial revolution”, but the word “industrial” suggests an inappropriately narrow sectoral impact of innovation. The acceleration of technical progress affected a very wide range of economic activity and there were improvements in organisation which also contributed to accelerated growth. The innovations which were most important in diffusing growth worldwide were the advances in transport and communication. The first ship to use steam power appeared in the United Kingdom in 1812, and by the 1860s virtually all new ships used coal as the source of power. By 1913, less than 2 per cent of British shipping used sail. The power of ships’ motors and their fuel efficiency increased steadily over the century. Iron and steel ships became much bigger, quicker and more reliable than wooden vessels. From the 1880s there were regular transatlantic shipping lines, which could get from Liverpool to New York in ten days. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 cut the distance from London to Bombay by 41 per cent, to Madras by 35 per cent, Calcutta 32 per cent and Hong Kong 26 per cent. This reduced the fuel costs of steam ships, and put sailing ships at a major disadvantage, because of the lack of wind in the canal. As a result of cheap and reliable passenger services, there was a huge outflow of European migrants to the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina and Brazil. The net outflow from the United Kingdom from 1820 to 1913 was about 12 million (half of it from Ireland). From the rest of Europe it was about 14 million. The net outflow from India was over 5 million — about 4.5 million to Burma, Malaya and Sri Lanka, a third of a million to Africa, and another third of a million to the Caribbean (see Davis, 1951, pp. 99–101). The outflow from China to other Asian countries was bigger than that from India (see Purcell, 1965). Migration from Western Europe to North America, Latin America and Australia speeded the pace at which these areas could exploit their huge natural resources and raised the incomes of those who migrated. Emigrants’ remittances helped the countries of emigration. Migration accelerated per capita income growth in Ireland and Italy by reducing excess labour in their impoverished rural areas (see O’Rourke and Williamson, 1999, p. 155). Migration from India and China to the “vent–for–surplus” economies of Southeast Asia (Burma, Malaya, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam), had a similar impact. The acceleration in shipping and navigational technology was an extension of a process which had been under way since the thirteenth century 35 . American clipper ships were able to compete with steam in speed up to the 1860s. Long–term advances in land transport had been more modest, and the move from horse–drawn to railway freight was a more dramatic leap. Railway transport started in the North of England in 1826, and by 1913 there were nearly a million kilometres of railway track in service worldwide. Nearly half of these were in the United States and the other Western Offshoots. Another 30 per cent were in Europe, but both India and Argentina had a bigger rail network than the United Kingdom in 1913. This massive and costly railway investment opened up new lands for development, increased the effective size of markets, the scope for internal migration and urbanisation, changed the economics of industrial location, and greatly enhanced the possibilities for international specialisation (see O’Rourke and Williamson, 1999, pp. 41–54 for a detailed analysis of the fall in transport costs and their impact). In this railway development, as in shipbuilding, Britain played a leading part in diffusing and financing the new technology.

The invention of mechanical refrigeration created the possibility of long–distance transport of meat, dairy products and fruit by rail and by sea. In the 1870s refrigerator cars were introduced on US railroads. In 1879 the first shipments of frozen meat reached England from Australia, and in 1882 from New Zealand. In 1882, the first freezing plant was created in Buenos Aires for shipments of meat to England. Britain created a modern postal service in 1840 which operated a system of standardised charges for letters and parcels throughout the United Kingdom, and exploited the new railway facilities to ensure more rapid deliveries than by stage coach. But introduction of the telegraph in the 1850s had a much more dramatic effect on the communications of business and government. By 1870 the United Kingdom had direct contact with India and North America. This innovation helped greatly to integrate international financial markets because access to information was more or less instantaneous. By 1913 the role of the telegraph had been reinforced by the advent of the telephone, and preliminary developments in radio communication. Innovations in communications played a major part in linking national capital markets and facilitating international capital movements. The UK already had an important role in international finance, thanks to the soundness of its public credit and monetary system, the size of its capital market and public debt, and the maintenance of a gold standard since 1821 to stabilise its exchange rate. The existence of the empire had created a system of property rights which appeared to be as securely protected as those available to investors in British securities. It was a wealthy country operating close to the frontiers of technology, so its rentiers were attracted by foreign investment opportunities even when the extra margin of profit was small. From the 1870s onward there was a massive outflow of British capital for overseas investment. The UK directed about half of its savings abroad. French, German and Dutch investment was also substantial. By 1913, British foreign assets were equivalent to one and a half times its GDP, income from them meant that national income was more than 9 per cent greater than its domestic product. Table 2–26a shows the origin and location of this foreign capital as it stood in 1914. Movement of capital made a significant contribution to growth in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Argentina, Southern Brazil, Uruguay, Russia and South Africa, but its per capita impact was small in Asia (see Table 2–27). Most of it was in the form of bonds and a good deal was in railways. From 1870 to 1913, world capita GDP rose 1.3 per cent a year compared with 0.5 per cent in 1820–70 and 0.07 per cent in 1700–1820. The acceleration was due to more rapid technological progress, and to the diffusionist forces unleashed by the liberal economic order of which the United Kingdom was the main architect. It was not a process of global equalisation (see Table 3–1b on the widened interregional spread of incomes), but there were significant income gains in all parts of the world. Australia and the United States reached higher levels than the United Kingdom by 1913. Growth was faster than in the United Kingdom in most of Western and Eastern Europe, in Ireland, in all the Western Offshoots, in Latin America and Japan. In India, other Asia (except China) and Africa, the advances were much more modest, but per capita income rose more than a quarter between 1870 to 1913. Trade grew faster than income on a world basis and in virtually all countries from 1870 to 1913 (see Tables 3–2a and F–4). In all of these dimensions, the situation was an enormous improvement on the eighteenth century, when shipments of slaves were bigger than the movement of migrants, when capital flows and transfer of technology were of limited significance, and when commercial policy was conducted on a beggar– your–neighbour basis. Keynes (1919, pp. 9–10) provides an illuminating patrician perspective on the lifestyle and investment opportunities available to people like himself in Britain at the end of the liberal era: The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 103 

“The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect their early delivery on his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprise of any quarter of the world. He could secure forthwith, if he wished it, cheap and comfortable means of transport to any country or climate without passport or other formality, could despatch his servant to the neighbouring office of a bank for such supply of the precious metals as might seem convenient, and then proceed abroad to foreign quarters, without knowledge of their religion, language, or customs, bearing coined wealth upon his person, and would consider himself greatly aggrieved and much surprised at the least interference — He regarded this state of affairs as normal, certain, and permanent.” 

Wars, Depression and Exit from Empire, 1913–50 

This was a complex and dismal period, marked deeply by the shock of two world wars and an intervening depression 36 . The liberal economic order was shattered. World trade was much smaller in relation to world income in 1950 than it had been in 1913. International migration was a fraction of what it had been in the nineteenth century. Most of Western Europe’s foreign assets were sold, seized or destroyed. Overseas empires disappeared or were in an advanced state of disintegration. In spite of these disastrous shocks, and drastic reorientation of economic policy and policy instruments, their impact on world economic growth was smaller than might have been expected because the pace of technological advance was substantially faster in the twentieth century than in the nineteenth. Development of road vehicles sustained the earlier transport revolution. The number of passenger cars in Western Europe rose from about 300 000 in 1913 to nearly 6 million in 1950, and from 1.1 to 40 million in the United States (see Maddison, 1995 a, p. 72). There was a parallel transformation of road freight transport, and tractors had a significant impact in replacing horses in agriculture. Aviation had its main impact before 1950 on the technique of warfare, but its economic role in shrinking the significance of distance was already clear. Development of electricity to produce heat, light and power also had massive ramifications: “electricity freed the machine and tool from the bondage of place; it made power ubiquitous and placed it within the reach of everyone” (Landes, 1966, p. 509). It made it possible to create new kinds of factories to assemble and mass produce automobiles and a huge range of new household products — sewing machines, refrigerators, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, radios and cameras. It contributed to a vastly popular new brand of popular cinematic entertainment. There were important advances in chemistry, which made it possible to create synthetic materials, fertilisers, pharmaceuticals which had important implications for economic potential and medicine. The leading role in developing these twentieth century technologies was played by the United States, which had become the world leader in terms of productivity and per capita income. The driving forces of innovation had changed from the nineteenth century, with a reduced role for the individual inventor, and greater emphasis on applied scientific research of a type which the United States pioneered. It institutionalised innovation in a way the United Kingdom had never done. In 1913, there were about 370 research units in US manufacturing employing 3 500 people. By 1946 there were 2 300 units employing 118 000. In 1946 there were four scientific workers in US manufacturing per 1 000 wage earners, five times the ratio in the United Kingdom. US government–sponsored research played a much more important role in agriculture and mining than in the United Kingdom, and the link between business firms and universities was closer (see Mowery and Rosenberg, 1989). The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 104 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

The United States developed new forms of professional business management, where large enterprises played a strategic role in standardising and enlarging markets. Multi–unit firms coordinated advertising, packaging, transport, sales and marketing. They allocated large amounts of capital, spread risks and increased productivity over a large range of new industries. It is not easy to provide an aggregative estimate of the pace of technical change or its acceleration, but a rough proxy measure is the pace of advance in total factor productivity (the response of output to combined inputs of labour and capital) in the lead country with the highest productivity level. By 1913, it was the United States, not Britain, which operated closest to the technological frontier. Between 1913 and 1950, US total factor productivity grew by 1.6 per cent a year, more than four times as fast as it or the United Kingdom had achieved from 1870 to 1913. This was the first stage of a technological boom which lasted for 60 years. An acceleration of total factor productivity growth also occurred in the United Kingdom in 1913–50, though to a lesser degree than in the United States (see Maddison 1995 a,pp. 40–50, and 252–5). There was also an associated acceleration of growth of labour productivity in most West European countries (see Appendix E, Table E–8). The importance of this acceleration in growth potential was masked by the interwar behaviour of the United States, and the nature of its economic policy. In the 1930s, it had transmitted a strong deflationary impulse to the world economy by its deep depression which was reinforced by raising its tariffs and withdrawal from foreign investment. In Europe its potential was muted by two world wars which involved diversion of massive resources to mutual destruction. In the first world war, threequarters of a million British troops were killed in combat, and 7.8 million tons of shipping were lost (mainly in submarine attacks). But these losses were proportionately much smaller than those of France, Germany and Russia. The nominal value of its foreign assets was more or less the same at the end of the war as in 1914, whereas German assets were confiscated as reparations, and two thirds of French were lost through inflation and Russian default. Britain added to its overseas empire by acquiring Germany’s former colonies in Tanganyika and Namibia, and took over former Turkish possessions in the Middle East (Iraq, Jordan and Palestine), but a large part of Ireland became an independent republic. In the 1920s British growth was hampered by highly deflationary policies to drive down wages and maintain an overvalued currency at its prewar parity. Their objective was to restore London’s prewar role as an international financial centre and to serve the interests of rentiers who held bonds denominated in sterling. As a consequence, there were high levels of unemployment and loss of competitiveness in export markets. Britain had the worst performance in Western Europe in the 1920s, in terms of GDP growth and exports. The depression of the 1930s led to devaluation of sterling, a large cut in interest rates, an abandonment of free trade, and creation of a network of imperial preferences. These policies cushioned the impact of the world depression on domestic economy. Housing investment had been depressed by high interest rates in the 1920s, and responded very favourably to their decline. There was no British counterpart to the collapse of the banking system which took place in the United States, Germany and Austria. Exports to the empire were bolstered by devaluation and imperial tariff preferences. As a result the impact of the world depression was milder in the United Kingdom than in all West European countries, except Denmark. Britain came much closer to defeat in the second world war than in the first because Germany captured the whole of the West European continent in its rapid blitzkrieg . The eventual victory was due to very intensive domestic resource mobilisation, sale of foreign assets, financial, material and military support from the United States, Canada, India and Australasia, and Russian resistance to Germany on the Eastern front. The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 105 

The war changed the economics of empire. The Japanese quickly conquered British colonies in East Asia which could not be adequately defended. The strength of the nationalist movement made it politically necessary to finance military expenditure in India by borrowing rather than local taxation. As a result India was able to liquidate $1.2 billion of prewar debt and acquired sterling balances worth more than $5 billion. The costs of maintaining the empire now greatly outweighed the benefits, and the acceleration of technical progress had reinforced the attractions of domestic investment. The British withdrawal from India occurred in 1947, from Sri Lanka and Burma in 1948. The withdrawal from the African colonies followed a few years after the United States demanded the withdrawal of British forces from Egypt in 1956. The British imperial order was finished, as were those of Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Japan. In the West, the United States had emerged as the hegemonial power competing with the Soviet bloc for leverage in the newly independent countries of Africa and Asia. The foreign economic and commercial policy of the United States was very different from its prewar stance. It made major efforts to diffuse technology, to promote the outflow of capital and liberalisation of world trade. This new orientation was already manifest in 1948 in Marshall Plan aid for European reconstruction. 

XT HE I MPACT OF B RITISH E XPANSION IN THE A MERICAS , A FRICA AND A SIA 

As Europe’s major offshore island, Britain always had substantial overseas involvements. Until the eleventh century, Britain was a target for conquest and barbarian invasion. Between the twelth to the fifteenth centuries, under the Norman and Angevin dynasties, it was heavily engaged in attempts to acquire territory in France. Thereafter Britain was involved in many wars in Europe, mainly with Spain, France and the Netherlands, but the objectives were commercial or diplomatic. By the middle of the sixteenth century, the idea of European conquest had been abandoned. Although trade was developed in the Baltic and Mediterranean overseas ambitions were concentrated on the Americas and Asia. Until the nineteenth century the only significant interest in Africa was the slave trade. In the sixteenth century, the main activities outside Europe were piracy and reconnoitring voyages to explore the potential for developing a colonial empire. The boldest stroke was royal backing for the 1577–80 voyage of Drake, who took five ships and 116 men, rounded the Straits of Magellan, seized and plundered Spanish treasure ships off the coast of Chile and Peru, made useful contacts in the spice islands of the Moluccas, Java, the Cape of Good Hope and Guinea on his way back. Piracy and Britain’s support of the Dutch Republic provoked war with Spain from 1585 which lasted two decades. By this time, its maritime strength and skill were adequate to defeat the Spanish Armada. This was an invasion force of 130 ships from Cadiz which intended to rendezvous with a fleet of invasion barges in the Spanish Netherlands. The British victory at Gravelines prevented the rendezvous and forced the Spanish fleet to return home around the northwest of Scotland. Spain lost more than half of its fleet, and it was clear that Britain had acquired the naval power to support major ventures in the Americas and Asia. As overseas ventures were varied in character and became bigger in scope than those of any other European power, our survey is necessarily selective and is presented below under four headings: 

a) development of sugar colonies in the Caribbean and associated participation in the slave trade from Africa from the 1620s onwards; 

b) settlement of 13 colonies in North America between 1607 and 1713 which became the United States in 1776; The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 106 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

c) creation of an East Indian Trading Company in 1600 and its conquest of an Indian Empire after 1757; 

d) forcible opening of trade with China and establishment of the Treaty Port regime of free trade imperialism. 

a) The Caribbean and the Slave Trade 

The Caribbean islands were the first Spanish possessions in the Americas, but the native Arawaks in Hispaniola (Haiti and Dominican Republic) were quickly wiped out by disease and the Caribs in the Antilles were greatly depleted. Spanish interest switched to Peru and Mexico once large scale silver production started there in the middle of the sixteenth century. The British occupied the uninhabited island of Barbados in 1627 establishing tobacco plantations with a labour force of indentured white settlers. Dutch shippers in the Brazilian sugar trade promoted the idea of developing Caribbean sugar production with slave labour. Dutch entrepreneurs established sugar plantations in Barbados when they were expelled from Brazil. As the island was well watered, and the winds were favourable for a quick passage to Europe, it became Britain’s biggest sugar colony until Jamaica was captured from Spain in 1655. With similar help from the Dutch, the French developed sugar production in Martinique and Guadeloupe and later took over a much bigger area in Saint Domingue (Haiti). The Dutch were pushed out of the British and French colonies and created a smaller sugar economy in Surinam. Britain took some French islands (St. Vincent, Grenada, Dominica and Tobago) in 1763, and Trinidad from Spain in 1727. British entry to the slave trade was pioneered by Hawkins in 1562. Participation reached its peak in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries when Britain became the main slave shipper, bringing a total of 2.5 million Africans to the Americas (see Table 2–5). The traffic was heaviest to the Caribbean. The British staked out Sierra Leone and the upper Guinea coast in the seventeenth century as their source of supply, the French took slaves mainly from the Senegal–Gambia region and the Dutch from the Gold Coast. The Portuguese operated the Africa–Brazil trade further south in Angola. The Royal Africa Company had a monopoly on British slave trading from 1672 to 1698, but in the eighteenth century “individual entrepreneurs who organised one or several voyages had become the norm in the trade” (see Klein, 1999, p. 80). Apart from European traders, there was financial backing from merchants in New England, Virginia, the West Indies and Brazil. Slavers generally financed their purchases with trade goods (East Indian textiles, alcohol, tobacco, bar iron, weapons, jewellery, or cowrie shells from the Maldives — for use in Africa as currency). “In the overwhelming majority of cases it was the Africans who controlled the slaves until their moment of sale to the captain — African slave traders came down to the coast or the riverbanks in a relatively steady and predictable stream to well–known trading places — European traders tended to spend months on the coast or travelling upriver gathering their slaves a few at a time” (Klein, 1999, pp. 90–1). Within Africa, slaves were acquired as captives in local wars, as tribute from dependent tribes, or after condemnation as criminals, but there was also large scale slave raiding and kidnapping of individuals within Africa. Klein (1999, p. 129) estimated that of 18 million African slaves exported from 1500 to 1900, “11 million of them were shipped into the Atlantic economy. The other slaves were shipped into the Indian Ocean or across the Sahara to slave markets in the East.” The normal cargo per ship ranged between 400–500 slaves. Klein (1999, p. 139) estimates 12 per cent average mortality on the passage to America over the period 1590–1867 which he compares with 10 per cent in convict ships on the longer voyage to Australia in 1787–1800.

The average duration of a slave trading venture from Europe to Africa, the West Indies and back was about 20 months, including several months assembling the cargo in Africa, and two months for the voyage to the West Indies. Evidence for UK and French voyages suggests that the cost of trade goods was twice as big as the costs of shipping, insurance and wages of the crew. Klein (1999, p. 125) suggests that in the late eighteenth century, European trade goods represented less than 5 per cent of West African income. He (pp. 98) suggests that “slave trade profits were not extraordinary by European standards. The average 10 per cent rate obtained was considered a very good profit rate at the time, but not out of the range of other contemporary investments.” The impact of the Atlantic slave trade on African population growth was substantial. Between 1700 and 1800, African population increased from 61 to 70 million (see Table B–9a). In the same period, slavers delivered 6.1 million slaves to the Americas. With 12 per cent mortality on the voyage, this implies a shipment of about 6.9 million. After allowing for births foregone it seems possible that African population would have grown three times as fast in the eighteenth century without the Atlantic slave trade. If there had been no export of slaves to the Americas, economic development in the Caribbean, in Virginia, Maryland and the Carolinas would have been much more meagre. Smaller profit remittances from the colonies and the absence of income from the slave trade would have slowed British growth and European consumption of sugar would have been much smaller. There would also have been an adverse impact on the New England colonies because their prosperity depended in part on commodity exports and shipping services to the West Indies. The British abolished the slave trade in 1807, and slavery in 1833, with £20 million compensation to slaveowners and nothing for the slaves. France lost her major sugar colony in Haiti because of the success of the slave revolt which ended with independence in 1804. France abolished the slave trade in 1817 and slavery in 1848. The British abolition was due in substantial part to the success of humanitarian reformers in convincing public opinion to end a repugnant form of exploitation. The success of independence movements in North America in 1783, and in Latin America in the 1820s, the successful slave revolt in Haiti and the unsuccessful revolt in Jamaica in 1831–2 persuaded the planting lobby that their days were numbered, and that it was in their interest to settle for compensation. Brazil continued to import slaves until the 1850s when the trade was stopped by British naval intervention. Brazilian slavery was maintained until 1888. Spain restricted slave imports to its colonies until 1789, but thereafter opened them to all slave traders. It made a big push to increase sugar production in the nineteenth century in Cuba and Puerto Rico (the only colonies it retained in the Americas after the others became independent). Slavery was abolished in Puerto Rico in 1873 and in Cuba in 1880. In 1894, Cuban sugar production was 1.1 million tons, in the British Caribbean 260 000, French Caribbean 79 000, Puerto Rico 49 000 and Surinam 8 000 (see Williams, 1970, p. 378). As a substitute for labour imports from Africa, indentured workers from India were first brought to British Guiana in 1838. From then until 1914, the inflow of Indians to the British Caribbean amounted to 450 000. Javanese were brought to Surinam in large numbers, and Cuba imported 150 000 Chinese on a similar basis from 1849–75. However, the ending of slavery raised costs in the Caribbean sugar industry and weakened its competitive position. In 1787 the Caribbean accounted for 90 per cent of world sugar production. In 1894 its share was only 22 per cent (see Table 2–4). There was a greater diversification of Caribbean production with a greater role for coffee and cotton, but the main impact was stagnant or falling per capita income. Eisner (1961, pp. 119 and 153) shows per capita real income in Jamaica in 1930 about threequarters of that in 1830. Table 2–23 shows the dramatic decline in the importance of British trade with the Caribbean after 1820. The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 109 

b) The 13 North American Colonies 

The situation in North America was very different from that in the Caribbean. In the five colonies which relied most heavily on slave labour (Maryland, Virginia, the Carolinas and Georgia) slaves were about 40 per cent of the population in 1750, compared with 85 per cent in the Caribbean colonies. Whites (indentured servants and others) were a significant part of the labour force. The main crops in plantation agriculture were tobacco, rice and indigo, where work intensity was less than in sugar, and the climate was healthier than in the Caribbean. Life expectation and possibilities for natural growth of the black population were greater than in the Caribbean. Growth of the labour force depended less on the slave trade. In the Northern colonies, which had 56 per cent of the colonial population in 1750, slaves were less than 5 per cent. A large part of the labour force was employed in agriculture with very much greater land availability per capita than in the United Kingdom. The average family farm in New England, the mid–Atlantic States and Pennsylvania in 1807 had well over 100 acres (Lebergott, 1984, p. 17). Most of the northern colonies had been formed by protestants of various denominations who were keen on education. There were eight universities in the north (Harvard founded in 1636, Yale 1701, University of Pennsylvania 1740, Princeton 1746, Columbia 1754, Brown 1764, Rutgers 1766, Dartmouth 1769), only one (William and Mary, 1693) in the South (and none in the Caribbean). The level of education in the northern colonies was above that in the United Kingdom. Per capita income was about the same level as in the United Kingdom and more evenly distributed. Although the British Navigation Acts made the colonies route their most important exports to Europe and their imports from Europe through the United Kingdom, they provided favoured access to markets within the empire which were particularly important for exports of shipping services and ships. On the eve of the war of independence, the merchant marine of the colonies was over 450 000 tons, all of which (coastal craft, West Indies schooners, fishing and whaling boats, and ships for trade with England) were built in New England shipyards which had easy access to cheap timber, pitch and tar (see Table 2–15). In addition, American yards had built an increasing proportion of the British merchant fleet in the course of the eighteenth century. In 1774, 30 per cent of Britain’s million–ton merchant fleet was American built (see Davis, 1962, pp. 66–8). The North American colonies had a significant urban population in Boston, New York and Philadelphia. They had a politically sophisticated elite familiar with the ideas and ideals of the French enlightenment. Their incentive to break the colonial tie was reinforced in 1763, after the Seven Years war, in which the British ended French rule in Canada and French claims to territory west of the 13 colonies. Hitherto, the most likely alternative to British rule had been French rule. Thereafter it was independence. A striking characteristic of US economic growth after independence was its much greater dynamism than that of its neighbour Mexico, which was a Spanish colony until 1825. It is therefore useful to compare the different institutional, societal and policy influences transmitted by Spain and the United Kingdom. The main reasons for Mexican backwardness compared with the ex–British colonies in North America were probably as follows: 

a) The Spanish colony was subject to a bigger drain of resources to the metropole. In the first place a considerable part of domestic income went into the pockets of peninsular Spaniards who did not stay in the colony but took their savings back to Spain. Secondly there was official tribute of about 2.7 per cent of GDP (see Maddison, 1995 b, pp. 316–7). The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 110 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

b) The British colonial regime imposed mercantilist restrictions on foreign trade, but they were much lighter than in New Spain. Thomas (1965) has suggested that the net cost of British trade restrictions was about 42 cents per head in the American colonies in 1770 (about 0.6 per cent of GDP). 

c) The British colonies had a better educated population, greater intellectual freedom and social mobility. Education was secular with emphasis on pragmatic skills and yankee ingenuity of which Ben Franklin was the prototype. The 13 British colonies had nine universities in 1776 for 2.5 million people. New Spain, with 5 million, had only two universities in Mexico City and Guadalajara, which concentrated on theology and law. Throughout the colonial period the Inquisition kept a tight censorship and suppressed heterodox thinking. 

d) In New Spain, the best land was engrossed by hacienda owners. In North America the white population had much easier access to land, and in New England family farming enterprise was typical. Restricted access to land in Spanish colonies was recognised as a hindrance to economic growth both by Adam Smith and the Viceroy of New Spain. Rosenzweig (1963) quotes the latter (Revillagigedo) as follows (my translation): “Maldistribution of land is a major obstacle to the progress of agriculture and commerce, particularly with regard to entails with absentee or negligent owners. We have subjects of his majesty here who possess hundreds of square leagues — enough to form a small kingdom — but who produce little of value.” 

e) At the top of New Spain there was a privileged upper class, with a sumptuary lifestyle. Differences in status — a hereditary aristocracy, privileged groups of clergy and military with tax exemptions and legal immunities — meant that there was much less entrepreneurial vigour than in the British colonies. The elite in New Spain were rent–seekers with a low propensity to productive investment. 

f) In the government of New Spain, power was highly concentrated on the centre, whereas in British North America there were 13 separate colonies, and political power was fragmented, so there was much greater freedom for individuals to pursue their own economic interests. 

g) Another source of advantage for North America was the vigour of its population growth because of the rapid inflow of migrants. Population in North America rose tenfold from 1700 to 1820, and by less than half in Mexico. Economic enterprise was much more dynamic when the market was expanding so rapidly. 

c) India 

The British connection with India started in 1600 with the creation of a monopoly trading company (the East India Company — EIC). For the first century and a half, it operated around the Indian coast from bases in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. By the middle of the eighteenth century the main exports were textiles and raw silk from India, and tea from China. Purchases of Indian products were financed mainly by exports of bullion, and from China by export of opium and raw cotton from Bengal (see Table 2–20 and the above discussion of rivalry between the British, Dutch and French trading companies). Until the eighteenth century the British generally maintained peaceable relations with the Moghul empire whose authority and military power were too great to be challenged. After the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, Moghul control disintegrated. The Moghul emperor became a token suzerain and provincial governors became de facto rulers as nawabs of successor states 37 .Given the size of India, with a bigger population than Europe, its racial, linguistic and religious complexity, it is not surprising that it fell apart. At the height of its power, under Akbar, the Moghul Empire practised religious toleration. This is one of the reasons why it was more successful in establishing an extensive domain than the earlier Muslim sultanates of Delhi. Aurangzeb abandoned the policy of religious tolerance, destroyed Hindu temples, reimposed the jizya (a capitation tax on non–Muslims) and confiscated some non–Muslim princely states when titles lapsed. After his death, there was a series of wars for the spoils of empire. In Western India, the Mahrattas established an independent The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 111 

Hindu state with their capital at Poona. The Nizam–ul–Mulk , a high Moghul official who foresaw the collapse of the Empire, installed himself as the autonomous ruler of Hyderabad in 1724. In 1739, the Persian emperor Nadir Shah invaded India, massacred the population of Delhi and took away so much booty (including Shah Jehan’s peacock throne and the Kohinoor diamond) that he was able to remit Persian taxes for three years. He also annexed Punjab and set up an independent kingdom in Lahore. The Punjab was later captured by the Sikhs. In other areas which nominally remained in the Empire, e.g. Bengal, Mysore and Oudh, the power of the Moghul emperor declined, as did his revenue. Continuous internal warfare greatly weakened the economy and trade of the country. It was because of these internal political and religious conflicts that the EIC was able to gain control of India. It exploited the differences skilfully by making temporary alliances and picking off local potentates one at a time. Most of its troops were local recruits who were well disciplined and paid regularly. They conquered the Moghul province of Bengal in 1757, took over the provinces of Madras and Bombay in 1803, and seized the Punjab from the Sikhs in 1848. They also succeeded in driving their European commercial rivals — the French and Dutch — from India. The British government did not establish its own direct rule until after the Indian mutiny in 1857 when the East India Company was dissolved. After its military victory at Plassey in 1757, the EIC operated a dual system in Bengal in which it had control and the nawab was a puppet. The main objectives of the Company were to enrich its officials and finance its exports from the tax revenues of the province instead of shipping bullion to India. The extension of the EIC’s territorial conquests changed its role from trading to governance. The Company lost its trading monopoly in 1813 in India and in 1833 for China. Company policy was subjected to parliamentary surveillance in 1773, and the nawab was replaced by a Governor General (Warren Hastings) in direct charge of administration, but with Indian officials. Hastings was dismissed in 1782, and Cornwallis from 1785 created the basis on which colonial India was governed. All high level posts were reserved for the British, and Indians were excluded. A civil administration was created which was much more effective and cheaper than that of the Moghuls. From 1806 the Company trained its young recruits at Haileybury College near London. From 1833 nominees were selected by competitive examination. After 1853, selection was entirely on merit. In 1829, the system was strengthened by establishing districts throughout British India small enough to be controlled by an individual British official who exercised autocratic power as revenue collector, judge and chief of police. There was a strong streak of Benthamite radicalism in the EIC administration. James Mill, John Stuart Mill and Macaulay were influential Company officials, and Malthus was the professor of economics at Haileybury College. Bentham himself was consulted on the reform of Indian institutions and the Utilitarians used India to try experiments and ideas (e.g. competitive entry for the civil service) which they would have liked to apply in England. After the Indian Mutiny in 1857, when the British government took over direct control of India, these radical Westernising approaches were dropped, policy became more conservative, and there was no attempt at further extension of direct rule over provinces which were governed by Indian princes with British advisors 38 .The British raj was operated by remarkably few people. There were only 31 000 British in India in 1805 (of which 22 000 in the army, and 2 000 in civil government). In 1931, there were 168 000 (60 000 in the army and police, 4 000 in civil government and 60 000 employed in the private sector). They were never more than 0.05 per cent of the population — a much thinner layer than the Muslim rulers had been. The changes which the British made in the system of governance had major socioeconomic consequences (see Boxes 2–1 and 2–2 which contrast the Indian social structure at the peak of the Moghul empire and at the end of British rule). The British took over a Moghul tax system which provided a land revenue equal to 15 per cent of national income, but by the end of the colonial period, land tax was only 1 per cent of national income and the total tax burden 6 per cent. The main gains from tax reduction and associated changes in property rights went to upper castes in the village economy, to zamindars who became landlords, and village moneylenders. The wasteful warlord aristocracy of the Moghuls was The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 112 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006

eliminated, and replaced by a small Westernised elite with a smaller share of national income. Until the 1920s, the new elite was almost entirely British, with British consumption patterns. This greatly reduced the demand for the luxury products of India’s traditional handicrafts. The damage to India’s main industry was greatly reinforced in the nineteenth century by duty–free imports of British cotton textiles. In the first century of British rule, the changes in the social structure and replacement of old methods of governance led to continuance of the fall in per capita income which had started at the beginning of the eighteenth century as the Moghul state disintegrated. From 1857 to independence in 1947, there was a slow rise in per capita income, and faster population growth. Table 2–27 gives a rough comparative idea of changes in income and population in India and Britain from 1600 to the end of colonial rule in 1947. Table 2–21 provides a rough idea of the dimension of the “drain” of resources from India to the United Kingdom as a consequence of having foreign governance. This drain was about 0.9 to 1.3 per cent of Indian national income from 1868 to the 1930s. This meant a transfer of about a fifth of India’s net savings which might otherwise have been used to import capital goods. The drain was a major target of criticism by Indian nationalists from the end of the nineteenth century. Even more important from their point of view was the fact that 5 per cent of the national income represented consumption of British personnel in India. Most of this would have gone to an Indian elite if the British had left India 50 years earlier, and a modernising Indian elite might well have pursued policies more conducive to Indian development. However, if the British (or their French rivals) had not ruled India from the mid– eighteenth to late nineteenth century, it seems unlikely that a modernising elite or the legal and institutional framework for its operation would have emerged from the ruins of the Moghul Empire. As my conclusions on the impact and consequences of British rule are contestable, it seems useful to set out the evidence for my viewpoint in more detail in the following sections on: the socioeconomic structure which the British inherited from Moghul India; the British impact on Indian agriculture; and its impact on industry. 

The Socioeconomic Structure of Moghul India 

Muslims were the ruling elite in India from the thirteenth century until the British takeover. The Moghuls had the military power to squeeze a large surplus from a passive village society. The ruling class had an extravagant lifestyle whose needs were supplied by urban artisans producing high quality cotton textiles, silks, jewellery, decorative swords and weapons. The Moghul aristocracy were not landlords but were allotted the tax revenue from a specified area (i.e. they were given a jagir ). Part of the revenue was for their own sustenance, the rest was paid to the central treasury in cash or in the form of troop support. The aristocracy was not, in principle, hereditary. Moghul practice derived from the traditions of the nomadic societies which had created Islam in Arabia and the Ottoman Empire. Nobles were regularly posted from one jagir to another and their estates were liable to royal forfeit on death. This system of warlord predators led to a wasteful use of resources. There was little motive to improve landed property. Moghul officials needed high incomes because they had many dependants to support. They maintained polygamous households with vast retinues of slaves and servants. Military spending was also large because soldiering and wars were the main duty of the Moghul elite. The jagirdar had an incentive to squeeze village society close to subsistence, to spend as much as possible on consumption and to die in debt to the state. There were also Hindu nobles ( zamindars) who retained hereditary control over village revenues, and Hindu princes who continued to rule and collect revenues in autonomous states within the Moghul Empire, e.g. in Rajputana. The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 116 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

The reason why the Moghuls could raise so much revenue from taxation, without having a ruling class which directly supervised the production process, was that village society was very docile. The chief characteristic of Indian society which differentiated it from others was the institution of caste. It segregated the population into mutually exclusive groups whose economic and social functions were clearly defined and hereditary. Old religious texts classify Hindus into four main groups: brahmins, acaste of priests at the top of the social scale whose ceremonial purity was not to be polluted by manual labour; next in priority came the kshatriyas or warriors, thirdly the vaishyas or traders, and finally the sudras ,or farmers. Below this there were melechas or outcastes to perform menial and unclean tasks. Members of different castes did not intermarry or eat together, and kept apart in social life. The theoretical model of the Rigveda is a very simplified version of the Indian situation. Brahmins and untouchables were distinguishable everywhere, but the hierarchy of intermediate castes was complex and often did not conform to the kshatriya, vaishya, sudra categorisation. In relations with the state, the village usually acted as a unit. Land taxes were generally paid collectively and the internal allocation of the burden was left to the village headman or accountant. The top group were allies of the state, co–beneficiaries in the system of exploitation. In every village the bottom layer were untouchables squeezed tight against the margin of subsistence. Without the caste sanctions, village society would probably have been more egalitarian, and a more homogeneous peasantry might have been less willing to put up with such heavy fiscal levies. From an economic point of view, the most interesting feature of caste was that it fixed occupation by heredity . For priests or barbers the prospect of doing the same job as a whole chain of ancestors was perhaps not too depressing, but for those whose hereditary function was to clean latrines, the system offered no joys in this world. One reason they accepted it was the Hindu belief in reincarnation which held out the hope of rebirth in a higher social status to those who acquired merit by loyal performance of their allotted task in this world. Below the village society, about 10 per cent of the population lived in a large number of tribal communities. Aboriginal tribes led an independent pagan existence as hunters or forest dwellers, completely outside Hindu society and paying no taxes to the Moghuls. 

The British Impact on Indian Agriculture 

The colonial government modified traditional institutional arrangements in agriculture and created property rights whose character was somewhat closer to those under Western capitalism. Except in the autonomous princely states, the old warlord aristocracy was dispossessed. Their previous income from 

jagirs and that of the Moghul state was appropriated by the British. In the Bengal Presidency (i.e. modern Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and part of Madras) the second layer of Moghul property rights belonging to tax collectors ( zamindars ) was reinforced. They acquired hereditary status, so long as they paid their land taxes, and their tax liabilities were frozen at the 1793 level. In the Madras and Bombay Presidencies the British dispossessed most of the old Moghul and Mahratta nobility and big zamindars, and vested property rights and tax obligations in the traditionally dominant castes in villages. Lower–caste cultivators became their tenants. Because of the emergence of clearer titles, it was now possible to mortgage land. The status of moneylenders was also improved by the change from Muslim to British law. There had been moneylenders in the Moghul period, but their importance grew substantially under British rule, and over time a considerable amount of land changed hands through foreclosures. Over time, two forces raised the income of landowners. One of these was the increasing scarcity of land as population expanded. This raised land values and rents. The second was the decline in the incidence of land tax. As a result, there was an increased income and a widening of inequality within villages. The village squirearchy received higher incomes because of the reduced burden of land tax The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 117 

and the increase in rents; the income of tenants and agricultural labourers declined because their traditional rights were curtailed and their bargaining power was reduced by greater land scarcity. The class of landless agricultural labourers grew in size under British rule. The colonial government increased the irrigated area about eightfold. Eventually more than a quarter of the land of British India was irrigated, compared with 5 per cent in Moghul India. Irrigation was extended both as a source of revenue and as a measure to mitigate famines. A good deal of the irrigation work was in the Punjab and Sind. The motive here was to provide land for retired Indian army personnel, many of whom came from the Punjab, and to build up population in an area which bordered on the disputed frontier with Afghanistan. These areas, which had formerly been desert, became the biggest irrigated area in the world and major producers of wheat and cotton, both for export and for sale in other parts of India. Improvements in transport facilities (particularly railways, but also steamships and the Suez canal) helped agriculture by permitting some degree of specialisation on cash crops. This increased yields somewhat, but the bulk of the country stuck to subsistence farming. Plantations were developed for indigo, sugar, jute and tea. These items made a significant contribution to exports, but in the context of Indian agriculture as a whole, they were not very important. In 1946, the two primary export items, tea and jute, were less than 3.5 per cent of gross value of crop output. Thus the enlargement of markets through international trade was less of a stimulus in India than in other Asian countries such as Burma, Ceylon, Indonesia or Thailand. Under British rule, the Indian population remained subject to recurrent famines and epidemic diseases. In 1876–8 and 1899–1900 famine killed millions of people. In the 1890s there was a widespread outbreak of bubonic plague and in 1919 a great influenza epidemic. In the 1920s and 1930s there were no famines, and the 1944 famine in Bengal was due to war conditions and transport difficulties rather than crop failure. However, the greater stability after 1920 may have been partly due to a lucky break in the weather cycle rather than to a new stability of agriculture. 

The British Impact on Indian Industry 

Moghul India had a bigger industry than any other country which became a European colony, and was unique in being an industrial exporter in pre–colonial times. A large part of this industry was destroyed as a consequence of British rule. Between 1757 and 1857 the British wiped out the Moghul court, and eliminated three–quarters of the aristocracy (except those in princely states). They also eliminated more than half of the local chieftainry ( zamindars ) and in their place established a bureaucracy with European tastes. The new rulers wore European clothes and shoes, drank imported beer, wines and spirits, and used European weapons. Their tastes were mimicked by the male members of the new Indian “middle class” who acted as their clerks and intermediaries. As a result of these political and social changes, about threequarters of the domestic demand for luxury handicrafts was destroyed. This was a shattering blow to manufacturers of fine muslins, jewellery, luxury clothing and footwear, decorative swords and weapons. My own guess would be that the home market for these goods was about 5 per cent of Moghul national income and the export market for textiles probably another 1.5 per cent. The second blow came from massive imports of cheap textiles from England after the Napoleonic wars. Home spinning, which was a part–time activity of village women, was greatly reduced. Demand for village hand–loom weaving changed with a substantial switch to using factory instead of home– spun yarn. Modern cotton mills were started in Bombay in 1851, preceding Japan by 20 years and China by 40. Production was concentrated on coarse yarns which were sold domestically and to China and Japan. Exports were half of output. India began to suffer from Japanese competition in the 1890s. Exports to Japan were practically eliminated by 1898. Shortly after, Japanese factories in China began to reduce The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 118 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

India’s market there. By the end of the 1930s, Indian exports of yarn to China and Japan had disappeared, piece goods exports had fallen off, and India imported both yarn and piece goods from China and Japan. If the British had been willing to give tariff protection, India could have copied Lancashire’s textile technology more quickly. Instead British imports entered India duty free. By the 1920s when Indian textile imports were coming mainly from Japan, British policy changed. By 1934 the tariff on cotton cloth had been raised to 50 per cent with a margin of preference for British products. As a result there was a considerable substitution of local textiles for imports. In 1896 Indian mills supplied only 8 per cent of Indian cloth consumption, in 1913 20 per cent and in 1945 76 per cent. By the latter date there were no imports of piece goods. Modern jute manufacturing started in 1854 and the industry expanded rapidly in the vicinity of Calcutta. It was largely in the hands of foreigners (mainly Scots). Between 1879 and 1913 the number of jute spindles rose tenfold — much faster than growth in the cotton textile industry. Most of the jute output was for export. Coal mining, mainly in Bengal, was another industry which achieved significance. Its output, which by 1914 had reached 15.7 million tons, largely met the demands of the Indian railways. In 1911 the first Indian steel mill was built by the Tata Company at Jamshedpur in Bihar. The Indian industry started 15 years later than in China, where the first mill was built at Hangyang in 1896. The first Japanese mill was built in 1898. In both China and Japan the first steel mills (and the first textile mills) were government enterprises. Indian firms in industry, insurance and banking were given a boost from 1905 onwards by the 

swadeshi movement, which was a nationalist boycott of British goods in favour of Indian enterprise. During the First World War, lack of British imports strengthened the hold of Indian firms on the home markets for textiles and steel. After the war, under nationalist pressure, the government started to favour Indian enterprise in its purchase of stores and it agreed to create a tariff commission in 1921 which started raising tariffs for protective reasons. Many of the most lucrative commercial, financial, business and plantation jobs in the modern sector were occupied by foreigners. Long after the East India Company’s legally enforced monopoly privileges were ended, the British continued to exercise effective dominance through their control of the banking sector 39 and the system of “managing agencies”. These agencies, originally set up by former employees of the East India Company, were used both to manage industrial enterprise and to handle most of India’s international trade. They were closely linked with British banks, insurance and shipping companies. Managing agencies had a quasi–monopoly in access to capital, and they had interlocking directorships which gave them control over supplies and markets. They dominated the foreign markets in Asia. They had better access to government officials than did Indians. The agencies were in many ways able to take decisions favourable to their own interests rather than those of shareholders. They were paid commissions based on gross profits or total sales and were often agents for the raw materials used by the companies they managed. Thus the Indian capitalists who did emerge were highly dependent on British commercial capital and many sectors of industry were dominated by British firms, e.g. shipping, banking, insurance, coal, plantation crops and jute. Indian industrial efficiency was hampered by the British administration’s neglect of technical education, and the reluctance of British firms and managing agencies to provide training or managerial experience to Indians. Even in the Bombay textile industry, where most of the capital was Indian, 28 per cent of the managerial and supervisory staff were British in 1925 (42 per cent in 1895) and the British component was even bigger in more complex industries. This naturally raised Indian production costs 40 .At lower levels in the plant there was widespread use of jobbers for hiring workers and maintaining discipline and workers themselves were a completely unskilled group who had to bribe the jobbers to get and retain their jobs. There were also problems of race, language and caste distinctions between The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 119 

management, supervisors and workers. The small size and very diversified output of the enterprises hindered efficiency. It is partly for these reasons (and the overvaluation of the currency) that Indian exports had difficulty in competing with Japan. 

d) China 

Until the nineteenth century China was a much bigger and more powerful state than any in Europe or Asia. Its technical precocity and meritocratic bureaucracy gave it higher levels of income than Europe from the fifth to the fourteenth century (see Figure 1–4). Thereafter Europe slowly forged ahead in terms of per capita income, but Chinese population grew faster. Chinese GDP in 1820 was nearly 30 per cent higher than that of Western Europe and its Western Offshoots combined 41 .In the first three centuries of European trade expansion, China had been much more difficult to penetrate than the Americas, Africa or the rest of Asia. Such trade as there was, was on conditions laid down by China. Between the 1840s and 1940s, China’s economy collapsed. Per capita GDP in 1950 was less than threequarters of the 1820 level. Population growth was interrupted by major military conflict. In 1950, China’s GDP was less than a twelfth of that in Western Europe and the Western Offshoots. The period of China’s decline coincided with commercial penetration by foreign powers and the Japanese attempt at conquest. There are clear links between the two processes, but there were also internal forces which contributed to China’s retrogression. China turned its back on the world economy in the early fifteenth century, when its maritime technology was superior to that of Europe (see Table 2–11). Thereafter it was left without naval defences. China’s highly educated elite showed no interest in the technological development and military potential of Western Europe. A British mission in 1793 tried to open diplomatic relations and demonstrate the attractions of western science and technology with 600 cases of presents (including chronometers, telescopes, a planetarium, chemical and metal products). The official rebuff stated “there is nothing we lack — we have never set much store on strange or ingenious objects, nor do we want any more of your country’s manufactures.” China did not start establishing legations abroad until 1877. The Manchu dynasty was in a state of collapse from the mid–nineteenth century, and the Kuomintang regime which followed was equally incompetent. The dynastic collapse paralleled that of the Moghul regime in India, which led to British takeover there. However, Western colonialism in China was very different from that in India, and it was Japan, not the Western colonial powers, which attempted conquest. Colonial penetration was inaugurated with the capture of Hong Kong by British gunboats in 1842. The immediate motive was to guarantee free access to Canton to exchange Indian opium for Chinese tea. A second Anglo–French attack in 1858–60 opened access to the interior of China via the Yangtse and the huge network of internal waterways which debouched at Shanghai. This was the era of free trade imperialism. Western traders were individual firms, not monopoly companies. In sharp contrast to their hostile and mutually exclusive trade regimes in the eighteenth century, the British and French had made their Cobden–Chevalier Treaty to open European commerce on a most–favoured–nation basis. They applied the same principle in the treaties imposed on China. Hence 12 other European countries, Japan, the United States, and three Latin American countries acquired the same trading privileges before the first world war. The treaties forced China to maintain low tariffs. They legalised the opium trade. They allowed foreigners to travel and trade in China, giving them extra–territorial rights and consular jurisdiction in 92 “treaty ports” which were opened between 1842 and 1917. To monitor the Chinese commitment to low The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 120 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

tariffs, a Maritime Customs Inspectorate was created (with Sir Robert Hart as Inspector General from 1861 to 1908) to collect tariff revenue for the Chinese government. A large part of this was earmarked to pay “indemnities” which the colonialists demanded to defray the costs of their attacks on China. The centre of this multilateral colonial regime was the international settlement in Shanghai. The British picked the first site in 1843 north of the “native city”. The French, Germans, Italians, Japanese and Americans had neighbouring sites along the Whangpoo river opposite Pudong, with extensive grounds for company headquarters, the cricket club, country clubs, tennis clubs, swimming pools, the race course, the golf club, movie theatres, churches, schools, hotels, hospitals, cabarets, brothels, bars, consulates and police stations of the colonial powers. There were similar facilities, on a smaller scale, in Tientsin and Hankow. Most of the Chinese allowed into these segregated settlements were servants 42 .Apart from the British colony of Hong Kong, there were five “leased” territories ceded to Britain, France, Germany, Japan and Russia. These included Britain’s 100 year lease on the New Territories adjacent to Hong Kong, granted in 1898. Foreign residents and trading companies were the main beneficiaries of this brand of free trade imperialism and extra–territorial privilege. The settlements were glittering islands of modernity, but the character of other Chinese cities did not improve, and those which had been damaged by the massive Taiping rebellion of 1850–64 had deteriorated. Chinese agriculture was not significantly affected by the opening of the economy, and the share of exports in Chinese GDP was small (0.7 per cent of GDP in 1870, 1.2 per cent in 1913) — much smaller than in India. China regained its tariff autonomy in 1928 and there was some relaxation of other constraints on its sovereignty in the treaty ports. However, this was offset by intensified pressures from Japan. The biggest intrusions into Chinese sovereignty and the biggest damage to its economy came from Japan. In the 1590s, Hideyoshi had made an earlier attempt to attack China by invading Korea, and the Meiji regime repeated this strategy with greater success in 1894–5. There was a gradual build–up of pressure from the 1870s, when Japan sent a punitive force to Taiwan and asserted its suzerainty over the Ryuku islands (Okinawa). In 1876 a Japanese naval force entered Korea and opened the ports of Pusan, Inchon and Wonsan to Japanese consular jursidiction. In 1894, Japan declared war on Korea, and its forces crossed the Yalu river into China. In the Treaty of Shimonoseki, 1895, China was forced to recognise that its suzerainty over Korea had lapsed, Taiwan and the Pescadores were ceded to Japan. Japanese citizens (and hence other foreigners) were now permitted to open factories and manufacture in China. China was forced to pay an indemnity which amounted to a third of Japanese GDP, which China had to finance by foreign borrowing. This sparked off an avalanche of further foreign claims, and a Chinese declaration of war on the foreign powers in 1900. Within two months China was defeated by joint action of the foreign powers and Russia occupied Manchuria. Japan defeated Russia in the war of 1905, and took over Southern Manchuria. Korea became a Japanese protectorate, and in 1910 a Japanese colony. Japan took Manchuria in 1931 and established a puppet state (Manchukuo) in 1933 which incorporated China’s three Manchurian provinces, parts of Inner Mongolia, Hopei and Liaoning. China was obliged to turn the area around Peking and Tientsin into a demilitarised zone, which left North China defenceless. In July 1937, the Japanese attacked again. They presumably expected to take over the whole of North China after a short campaign, and thereafter to dominate a compliant government in the South as part of their new order in Asia. However, the Chinese government reacted strongly, and the war with Japan lasted for eight years. Its impact was compounded by the civil war between the Kuomintang and communist forces. Thus China endured 12 years of war from 1937 to 1949. The destructive impact was similar proportionately to that of the Taiping rebellion of 1850–64.

He concluded that “in the period of Roman imperial expansion and in the High Empire (200 BC — 200 AD) there was more sea– borne trade in the Mediterranean than ever before and more than there was for the next thousand years.” He shows that the level in 400–650 AD was about a fifth of that in the peak period. Ashtor (1976), p. 102 analyses Arab evidence on Mediterranean trade and concludes: “when the Arabs had established their rule over the eastern, southern and western coasts of the Mediterranean, it became the frontier between two civilisations, strange, unknown and hostile to each other. What had been a great lake on whose shores rulers, laws, religion and language were the same or similar became the scene of naval warfare and piracy. Trade disappeared almost entirely in the Mediterranean in the course of the eighth century. Spices, precious silk fabrics and other Oriental articles were hardly to be found in Western Europe.” 6. See Pirenne, Mohammed and Charlemagne (1939), p. 242. Although Pirenne’s description of the ninth century situation is succinct, striking and basically correct, his prior analysis of the timing and causes of Roman decline is difficult to swallow. He argued that the barbarian takeover in Gaul and Italy preserved a good deal of the advantages of Roman civilisation, and that its demolition was due to the Islamic invaders and Charlemagne. Hodges and Whitehouse (1998) summarise modern archaeological evidence and previous critical reactions to Pirenne’s thesis. They conclude that Pirenne exaggerated the survival of Roman institutions: “By the end of the sixth century, conditions in the Western Mediterranean bore little resemblance to those in the second century. Before the Arabs arrived the transformation was virtually complete.” (p. 53) 7. See Lane and Mueller (1985). 8. These fairs were held six times a year about 40 kilometres southeast of Paris and 110 kilometres from Bruges. Two fairs were held in Troyes, two in Provins, one in Lagny and the other at Bar–sur–Aube. They were the major centres of West European commercial activity from 1200 to 1350. They attracted merchants from all regions of France, northern and central Italy, Flanders, Hainault, Brabant, Spain, England, Germany and Savoy. The lords of the fair were the Counts of Champagne and later the French King. They derived income from taxes, tolls and safe–conduct charges on merchants. In return their agents kept law and order, helped to enforce contracts and kept notarial records. In cases of dispute, most Italian towns were represented by their consuls. The fairs petered out when the sea route from Italy to Flanders was opened (see Verlinden, 1963). 9. See Lane (1973), p. 19. 10.

11. Possibilities for trade in the western Mediterranean had already been opened up by the recovery of Sicily (1090), Corsica (1091), Sardinia and Majorca (1232) from Arab control. This benefited the trade of Genoa, Barcelona and Provence. 12. See Landes (1998), pp. 46–7: “By the middle of the fifteenth century, Italy, particularly Florence and Venice, was making thousands of spectacles, fitted with concave as well as convex lenses, for myopes as well as presbyopes.” 13. In the field of learning, it should be remembered that the University of Padua was part of the Venetian domain since its foundation in 1405. Its cosmopolitan faculty made major contributions to Renaissance scholarship and to scientific development. Its professors included Galileo, and the Flemish anatomist, Vesalius. 14. Henrique was influential in instigating a Portuguese attack on Morocco in 1415. The strategic port of Ceuta was captured and became a Portuguese stronghold (until 1580 when it was ceded to Spain). Ceuta was one of the terminals of the Sahara gold caravans. It was a useful port for Genoese, Venetian and Catalan merchants moving from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, and seemed to be a first step in the conquest of Morocco. However, an attempt to take Tangier in 1437 was an ignominious failure. Henrique saved the remnant of his troops by promising to surrender Ceuta and leaving his younger brother as an Arab hostage. He kept Ceuta and left his brother to a nasty death (see Russell, 2000). 15. See Schwartz (1985), pp. 4, 7 and 504. 16. Barrett in Tracy (1990), p. 247, gives figures for West Africa gold exports for 1471 to 1800. From 1471 to 1700 they amounted to 145 tons of which most would have gone to Portugal. 17. The Portuguese were convinced that there were large Christian communities in Africa and Asia, and one of the missions of the explorers was to investigate the myth of the kingdom of Prester John. The Portuguese spy Covilhã went to Ethiopia in 1493 as part of this search. He stayed to work for the negus, the Ethiopian King and was found there in 1520. Elsewhere in Africa the only sizeable community was Copts in Egypt. There were small Christian communities in Southern India. 18. In order to check Cabral’s discovery, the Portuguese engaged the Florentine navigator, Amerigo Vespucci to explore the Brazilian coast in 1501. He had carried out an exploratory trip two years earlier along the coast of Venezuela and Guiana for Spain. Needham (1971), Vol.IV:3, p. 513 refers to suggestions that the existence of Brazil was already known to the Portuguese before the Columbus voyage to the Caribbean. 19. Subrahmanyam (1997), p. 182 quotes a figure of “4 000 cantari”. This measure has a wide range of possible meanings. Ashtor (1980) pp. 756–7, defines “kintars” (a measure used for Venetian spice exports from Alexandria) as 180 kg. I have assumed that this is the unit used in the source quoted by Subrahmanyam. 20. Needham (who was a biochemist) explains the European demand for spices as follows: “The usual idea is that pepper and spices were simply for table condiments or sauces designed to disguise the taste of tainted meat. But this could never have accounted for the vast imports of the Western Middle Ages –– we are bound to suppose that as in traditional China and the Islamic lands the pepper was actually mixed with the salt for — the meat to be preserved. The addition of spices in the correct amount permitted — inhibition of the autolytic enzymes as well as bacteriostatic action and an anti–oxidant effect on fats” (see Needham, Vol.IV:3, 1971, pp. 520–1). Landes (1998), pp. 132–3 makes the last point in different language: “people of that day could not know this, but the stronger spices worked to kill or weaken the bacteria and viruses that promoted and fed on decay.” 21. See Tibbetts (1981) for a translation of the work of the leading Arab navigator Ibn Majid, and Jones (1978) for illustrations of Arab instruments to use stars and the sun for navigation. 22. See Goitein (1967) for the activity of Jewish communities throughout the Arab world of the Mediterranean. 23. See Subrahmanyam (1997), p. 96. 24. Albuquerque was Portuguese Viceroy in Asia in 1509–15. It was he who established the bases in Goa and Malacca. He selected Goa, after an attempt to take Calicut, where the Portuguese made a landing but were cut to pieces. The elimination of the Muslim position in Goa was welcome to the Hindu monarchs of Vijayanagar, with whom the Portuguese established friendly relations (see Panikkar, 1953, pp. 38–9. The Impact of Western Development on the Rest of the World 123 

25. The Grand Canal was about 10 times the length of the largest European venture — the Canal de Languedoc — built by Colbert and operational from 1681. Its length was 240 kilometres, and was confined to relatively small vessels (see Parry, 1967, p. 215). 26. In 1640 when Portugal regained independence from Spain, it allied itself closely with the United Kingdom. The British were allowed to have merchants in Brazil and Portugal, to engage in the carrying trade, were granted extra–territorial rights, and duties on British goods were bound at a fixed level. In 1703, the Methuen Treaty gave British goods free access to Brazil and the Portuguese market. In return, the United Kingdom propped up the Portuguese Empire with military guarantees. 27. Mulhall (1899), p. 172, shows Brazilian customs receipts equal to 21 per cent of trade turnover (about 37 per cent of imports after allowing for export taxes of about 5 per cent) in 1887 compared with a world average of 5.6 per cent. The ratio of customs receipts to trade turnover was highest in Portugal (41 per cent), next highest in the United States (15 per cent). In Holland it was 0.2 per cent; Belgium 1.1; India 2.2, and the United Kingdom 3.1. Mulhall also shows (p. 258) that in the decade 1871–1880 Brazil received 72 per cent of its revenues from customs duties (higher than any other country). In India it was only 4 per cent (the lowest). 28. From 1384 Flanders and Brabant, and from 1428 the province of Holland, were part of the Duchy of Burgundy whose headquarters were in Brussels. This was the main seat of the Duke and his court, with occasional sorties to Dijon and Bruges. The area of the future Belgium and the Netherlands had 17 provinces (staten) which sent representatives annually to a meeting of the States General where they were told what taxes they had to raise. The provinces were grouped under three governors (stadholders) selected from the nobility. The cities enjoyed considerable “liberties”. These rights were exercised by a wealthy commercial elite which regulated industrial standards and arrangements for periodic fairs and staples for exports. There were three bishoprics within the area of the 17 provinces, and two others within the area of northern France under Burgundian control. It was a fragmented, and, by later standards, reasonably benign form of governance. The Duchy recognised French sovereignty, but was in fact autonomous. In 1477 the last Burgundian heir married Maximilian of Habsburg, and after her death in 1482, the territory became effectively a component of the Holy Roman Empire. Maximilian was Emperor from 1493 to 1519 and Charles V from 1519 to 1555. Habsburg rulers curtailed the privileges of the Burgundian nobility and the cities and imposed higher taxes. When the protestant reformation (Lutheran, Anabaptist and Calvinist) affected the provinces, there was a ruthless suppression of heresy. Charles V retired as emperor in 1555, and divided the Empire by giving the Austrian part to his brother, and the rest to his son, Philip II. In fact Philip was effectively in charge of the Netherlands for 50 years from his first visit to Brussels in 1548 until his death in 1598. The Netherlands was the richest region of his colossal empire and his intention was to squeeze it to finance his wider commitments and ambitions — which involved him in war with France, an attempted invasion of England and a massive naval conflict with the Ottoman empire. He used matrimony as well as war to further his ambitions, marrying successively Mary of Portugal (1543); Mary Queen of England (1554); Isabella of France (1559); Anne of Austria (1570). He squandered the silver tribute from Mexico and Peru, and fiscal irresponsibility led to a sequence of defaults on public debt in 1557, 1575, and 1597. The net impact of his activity was to weaken Spain. Between 1609 and 1621 there was a truce in the war between Spain and the Dutch Republic. Hostilities were renewed in the 1620s when the two countries were on opposite sides in the 30 years struggle between protestant and catholic states in Germany. Spanish forces attacked the Netherlands from Germany, but after the 1630s were never again a serious threat to the Dutch. Spanish sovereignty in Belgium continued until 1714, when it was transferred to Austria, after the war of Spanish succession. 29. The seven provinces of the Netherlands emerged as an independent state with the formation of the Union of Utrecht in 1579, formally rejecting Spanish sovereignty in 1581. The new state was not quite a republic or a monarchy. It incorporated “generality” lands in northern Brabant including Breda, Bergen op Zoom and Maastricht. They were not treated as provinces, partly because the house of Orange enjoyed extensive seigneurial rights in Breda. William, Prince of Orange, Count of Nassau (1533–84) played a major part in the creation of the new state. He was the wealthiest of the Burgundian–Habsburg nobility, with extensive properties around Breda, in Germany and Provence. He was educated as a catholic in Brussels, served with distinction in the Spanish army against France, enjoyed high standing with the Emperor Charles V for whom he was governor (stadholder) of Holland and Zeeland. When he objected to the repressive policies of Philip II, his properties were seized, and a reward was offered for his assassination. He organised military and naval resistance to The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 124 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

the Spanish forces, converted to Calvinism and was recognised as stadholder of the provinces of Holland, Zeeland, Friesland and Utrecht in the new state. He was assassinated in 1584. Thereafter the House of Orange played a leading, but not continuous role as stadholders, and eventually in 1814 became hereditary monarchs of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Their lands in Orange were seized by Louis XIV who incorporated them into France in 1685. The most prominent members of the house were Count Maurice (who had a leading role as a soldier defending the Republic from 1584 to 1625) and William, Prince of Orange, who was stadholder from 1672 and King of England from 1688 to his death in 1702. The British Ambassador to the Hague, Sir William Temple (1693, p. 133), described the situation in 1670s as follows: “the states general represented the Sovereignty, so did the Prince of Orange the Dignity, of this State, by Public Guards and Attendance of all Military Officers — by the Splendor of his Court, and the Magnificence of his Expence, supported not only by the Pensions and Rights of his several Charges and Commands, but by a mighty Patrimonial Revenue in Lands and Sovereign Principalities, and Lordships, as well in France, Germany, as in several parts of the Seventeen Provinces.” 30. See Walter and Schofield (1989), p. 42: “Increased demand for non–cereal foodstuffs and non–agricultural products promoted mixed farming and a diversification of occupations in the countryside, leading to a better balance between cereal growing and animal husbandry, and, more generally to a strengthening of market networks. In addition, the increase in both the acreage and yields of oats and barley created a more advantageous mix to mitigate the impact of harvest failure by preventing the simultaneous failure of all crops.” In the same volume (p. 199), Dupaquier makes another important point: “in France there was little movement of grain, and it was difficult to compensate for the effects of a poor regional harvest, whilst in England this could be done, thanks to the strategic role played by coastal shipping.” 31. See Brewer (1989), pp. 14–20. 32. See Gregory King’s manuscript notebook, p. 208, reproduced in Laslett (1973). 33. See Shammas, in Brewer and Porter (1993) pp. 182 and 184. 34.

For a much more detailed analysis of this period, see Maddison (1976) and (1995 a) pp. 65–73. 37. The present analysis of the British impact on India draws heavily on Maddison (1971). See also Habib (1995) and Lal (1988). 38. The “native states” ruled by princes with the guidance of British residents had about a fifth of India’s population. There were several hundred of them. The really big ones were Hyderabad, Jammu and Kashmir and Mysore. Portugal retained Goa with 0.15 per cent of India’s population, and the French had an even smaller toehold. 39. In 1913, foreign banks held over three–quarters of total deposits, Indian Joint Stock Banks less than one– fourth. In the eighteenth century there had been very powerful Indian banking houses (dominated by the Jagath Seths) which handled revenue remittances and advances for the Moghul Empire, the Nawab of Bengal, the East India Company, other foreign companies, and Indian traders, and which also carried out arbitrage between Indian currency of different areas and vintages. These indigenous banking houses were largely pushed out by the British. 40. See D.H. Buchanan, The Development of Capitalist Enterprise in India , Cass, London, 1966, pp. 211 and 321, who gives figures of the cost of European managerial personnel. In the Tata steelworks in 1921–2 the average salary of foreign supervisory staff was 13 527 rupees a year, whereas Indian workers got 240 rupees. These foreigners cost twice as much as in the United States and were usually less efficient. Use of foreign staff often led to inappropriate design, e.g. multi–storey mills in a hot climate or use of mule instead of ring spindles. 41. See Maddison (1998 a), pp. 22–3 on the strength and shortcomings of the system of governance in traditional China; and pp. 39–54 on the economic decline and external humiliation of China between 1840 and 1949. 42.

The World Economy in the Second Half of the Twentieth Century 125 Chapter 3 

# The World Economy in the Second Half of the Twentieth Century 

The world economy performed better in the last half century than at any time in the past. World GDP increased six–fold from 1950 to 1998 with an average growth of 3.9 per cent a year compared with 1.6 from 1820 to 1950, and 0.3 per cent from 1500 to 1820. Part of the acceleration went to sustain faster population growth, but real per capita income rose by 2.1 per cent a year compared with 0.9 per cent from 1820 to 1950, and 0.05 per cent from 1500 to 1820. Thus per capita growth was 42 times as fast as in the protocapitalist epoch and more than twice as fast as in the first 13 decades of our capitalist epoch. Interrelations between the different parts of the world economy have greatly intensified. The volume of commodity trade rose faster than GDP. The ratio of exports to world GDP rose from 5.5 per cent in 1950 to 17.2 in 1998 (see Table 3–2). There was a huge increase in international travel, communications and other service transactions. These improved the international division of labour, facilitated the diffusion of ideas and technology, and transmitted high levels of demand from the advanced capitalist group to other areas of the world. The flow of foreign investment to poorer parts of the world (Africa, Asia excluding Japan, and Latin America) rose at an impressive pace in the past half century (see Table 3–3). As a result, the stock of foreign capital rose from 4 to 22 per cent of their GDP. However, the present ratio is only two thirds of its 1914 level. Most of the huge expansion in international investment in the past half century took place within the advanced capitalist group. There was a resurgence in international migration. Table 3–4 shows that from 1950 to 1998, West European countries absorbed more than 20 million immigrants, Western Offshoots 34 million. There has been a distinct change in Western Europe. From 1870 to 1949 there was an exodus of people seeking better opportunities elsewhere. Since 1950 the situation has been completely reversed. Within the capitalist epoch, one can distinguish five distinct phases of development (see Table 3.1a). The “golden age”, 1950–73, was by far the best in terms of growth performance. Our age, from 1973 onwards (henceforth characterised as the “neoliberal order”) has been second best. The old “liberal order” 1870–1913, was third best, with marginally slower growth than our age. In the fourth best phase (1913–50), growth was obviously below potential because of two world wars and the intervening collapse of world trade, capital markets and migration. The slowest growth was registered in the initial phase of capitalist development (1820–70) when significant growth momentum was largely confined to European countries and Western Offshoots. Although our age is second best, and international economic relationships have been intensified through continuing liberalisation, the overall momentum of growth has decelerated abruptly, and the divergence in performance in different parts of the world has been sharply disequalising. In the golden age the gap in per capita income between the poorest and the richest regions fell from 15:1 to 13:1. Since then it has risen to 19:1 (see Table 3–1b).

Table 3.5 compares the experience of different parts of the world economy in the three most successful phases of capitalist development. Performance in 1973–98 is compared with that of the golden age, and the “liberal order” (1870–1913). Panel A shows the performance of 49 economies which produce more than threequarters of world GDP, and contain two thirds of world population. The advanced capitalist countries (Western Europe, Western Offshoots and Japan) together produce over half of world GDP. In this group, per capita growth in 1973–98 fell well below that in the golden age, but was appreciably better than in 1870–1913. The second part of Panel A shows the experience of “Resurgent Asia” — 15 countries which produce a quarter of world GDP and have half the world’s population. The success of these countries has been extraordinary. Their per capita growth was faster after 1973 than in the golden age, and more than ten times as fast as in the old liberal order. They have achieved significant catch– up on the lead countries, and are replicating (in various degrees of intensity) the big leap forward achieved by Japan in the golden age. Table 3–3.

If the world consisted only of the two groups of countries in Panel A, the pattern of world development could be interpreted as a clear demonstration of the possibilities for conditional convergence suggested by neo–classic growth theory. This supposes that countries with low incomes have “opportunities of backwardness”, and should be able to attain faster growth than more prosperous economies operating much nearer to the technological frontier. This potential can only be realised if such countries are successful in mobilising and allocating resources efficiently, improving their human and physical capital to assimilate and adapt appropriate technology. Resurgent Asia has seized these opportunities. The countries of Panel B have not. Their relative position has deteriorated sharply since 1973. Panel B shows the experience of “Faltering Economies”. Collectively they produce about a fifth of world GDP and have about a third of world population. In all these regions, deterioration in performance since the golden age has been alarming. In the successor states of the former USSR, it has been catastrophic.The aggregate per capita income of Panel B countries actually declined by 0.21 per cent a year in the last quarter century. In the golden age, their aggregate per capita performance was identical with that of the countries in Panel A. In 1870–1913 their aggregate performance was not much below that of Panel A countries. Before going into a detailed analysis of developments since 1973, one should note four major shocks which interrupted the momentum of growth and impacted unevenly in different parts of the world at different times. The first shock was a threefold challenge to the advanced capitalist group in the early 1970s (greatly accelerated inflation, the collapse of the Bretton Woods international monetary Table 3–5.

order, and OPEC action to raise oil prices). The second was the debt crisis which hit Latin America in the early 1980s. A third was the collapse of Japanese asset prices around 1990 which had an extraordinarily deflationary effect on what was formerly the world’s most dynamic economy. The fourth was the disintegration of the USSR in 1991. It involved collapse of Soviet control over the East European countries, dismantlement of COMECOM trade arrangements and the Warsaw Pact, and division of the USSR into 15 successor states. Although these shocks had a profound influence, the liberal international order proved remarkably robust. There was no collapse of world trade or capital markets, and although there were a number of minor wars, the potentially lethal implications for global conflict inherent in the old cold–war standoff were substantially mitigated. Developments within the fifth phase of capitalist development have been more complex in causality, have differed more between regions, and have been less synchronous than in the golden age. It is therefore necessary to examine the experience of each region separately. Table 3–6. Economic Characteristics of the 20 Biggest Countries, 1998

IA DVANCED C APITALIST C OUNTRIES Western Europe 

From 1973 to 1998, West European GDP grew at 2.1 per cent a year compared with 4.8 in the golden age. The deceleration had three components: a) a slowdown in population growth from 0.7 to 0.3 per cent a year, due to a significant and general fall in birth rates; b) very large rises in unemployment and other dimensions of labour slack; c) deceleration in labour productivity which grew at 2.3 per cent a year compared with 4.8 per cent in the golden age. It was inevitable that West European productivity growth would decelerate. In 1950–73, once– for–all opportunities for catch–up on the United States were available and were seized, and the rate of technical progress in the lead country (the United States) was then much faster than it has been since 1973. In fact the catch–up process continued after 1973. The average productivity level in Western Europe rose from two thirds of the American level in 1973 to more than four fifths in 1998. However, per capita income in most Western European countries rose more slowly than in the United States because of slack in their labour markets (see Table 3–7). The most disturbing aspect of West European performance since 1973 has been the staggering rise in unemployment. In 1994–8 the average level was nearly 11 per cent of the labour force (see Table 3–8). This is higher than in the depressed years of the 1930s, and four times the level in the golden age. Unemployment on this scale would have created a major depression if the unemployed had not received substantial income support from social security. The major reason for this rise was a change in macropolicy objectives. Initially, this was dictated by events but its continuance reflected a basic ideological shift. The “establishment view” of economic policy objectives in the golden age was characterised by Erik Lundberg (1968, p. 37) as follows: “In the postwar period, the achievement of full employment and rapid economic growth have become a primary concern of national governments. Such policy targets did not ... guide government activities during most of the interwar period ... instead there were various policy aims that today would largely be considered as either intermediate, secondary, irrelevant or irrational targets, such as the restoration or preservation of a specific exchange rate, the annual balancing of the government budget, and the stability of the price level at a prevailing or previously reached niveau”. In the course of the 1970s, the objectives of full employment and rapid economic growth were jettisoned, and the major emphasis switched to achieving price stability. Initially, the change had considerable conjunctural validity. After the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system, policymakers felt disoriented without a monetary anchor. This happened at a time of increased inflationary pressure, and expectations of accelerating inflation were greatly augmented by the first OPEC shock. It was felt that accommodation of inflation beyond a certain point would lead to hyperinflation, and that this would threaten the whole socio–political order. This was the razor’s edge theorem. Income policies had been discredited so disinflation seemed the only option. The change in the attitudes of policymakers was reinforced by changes in academic fashion. The Keynesians were pushed to the periphery, and lost their influence on policy. Politicians sought intellectual sustenance elsewhere. Friedman, Hayek and the neo–Austrians regarded unemployment as a useful corrective. The rational expectations school denied the usefulness of discretionary policy action. They argued that if simple rules were followed long enough, the economy would be self regulating. Responsibility for economic policy action should move from ministers of finance to central bankers. As far as possible, the latter should operate free from political pressure. The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 132 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

By 1983, deflationary policies had been quite successful, and the power of OPEC was greatly reduced. In 1973–83 inflation in Western Europe averaged 11.2 per cent a year, in 1983–93, it was 4.5 per cent. By 1993–8 it had fallen to 2.2 — about half the rate in the golden age (see Table 3–8). The persistence of deflationary policies in the 1990s in the face of high unemployment and low inflation was due in large measure to a new objective of policy — monetary union. Monetary union had been advocated within the EEC by the 1970 Werner Report, but this objective was abandoned in the monetary turmoil of the early 1970s and the collapse of the “snake” system (precursor of the EMS) in 1976. The EMS was created in 1979 to establish an area of exchange stability. From 1987 to 1992 it achieved reasonable success. As a result the objective of monetary union was disinterred and put forward in the Delors Report of 1989. This reiterated the importance of policy Table 3–7.

objectives which Lundberg had qualified as secondary or irrational in 1968. It made no mention of employment or growth objectives, nor did it give serious consideration to the institutional, social and economic costs of enforcing convergence and conformity in price, wage, monetary and fiscal behaviour. The major economic gain would be a reduction in transaction costs, improvement in economic stability, and economies of scale in a more integrated and more competitive European market. The proposal was adopted by the EC in 1991, and in the Maastricht Treaty of European Union which was ratified in 1993. The path to monetary union was not smooth. In 1992 there was a major currency crisis. After a costly defence of their existing exchange rates, there were a number of devaluations. Italy and the United Kingdom left the EMS. In 1993 pressures on the French franc led the EMS authorities to widen the permitted fluctuation band from 2.25 to 15 per cent. Nevertheless, the determination to succeed was very strong, particularly in countries which had historically had the biggest problems of inflation and exchange rate instability and whose long term gains from monetary union seemed most promising. They were willing to prolong the period of high unemployment to fulfil the “convergence” obligations of membership — reducing inflation to what were to them very low levels, maintenance of exchange rate stability and reduction of budget deficits. These policies were successful in achieving a remarkable degree of convergence, and monetary union was inaugurated at the beginning of 1999 with all of the aspirants except Greece being accepted as members (Greece joined in 2001). Although the intent of government policy in Western Europe was deflationary for a prolonged period, fiscal freedom was substantially constrained by welfare state commitments which are much larger than in the United States and Japan. When unemployment increased, transfer payments were triggered automatically. In many cases, particularly in France and the Netherlands, governments who considered unemployment to be caused by excess labour supply persuaded people to retire early or acquire “handicapped” status. There was also a steady build–up of pension benefits due to the ageing Table 3–8. Experience of Unemployment and Inflation in Advanced Capitalist Countries, 1950–98

of the population. Budget deficits were much higher in 1974–96 than in the golden age. They fell in 1997–98 when the pressure to fulfil the convergence criteria for monetary union was at its height. The deflationary intent of government policy can be more clearly seen in the level of real interest rates. These were very much higher in the period of moderate price rises after 1982 than they were in the golden age and the years of high inflation 1974–81. Since 1973, West European countries have given greater emphasis to use of market forces to improve efficiency of resource allocation. This was reflected in decisions to remove controls on international capital movements and privatisation of government enterprise. However, agriculture remains highly protected, regulation and tax policy are an impediment to efficient labour market functioning. 

United States 

American economic policy since 1973 has been much more successful than that of Western Europe and Japan in realising potential for income growth. The level of unemployment fell to less than half of that in Western Europe, whereas in 1950–73 it was usually double the European rate. Labour force participation increased, with employment expanding from 41 per cent of the population in 1973 to 49 per cent in 1998, compared with an average European rise from 42 to 44 per cent (see Table 3–7). Working hours per person rose whereas they fell in Western Europe. High levels of activity were achieved with a rate of inflation which was generally more modest than in Western Europe. US policymakers have been less inhibited in operating at high levels of demand than their European counterparts. Having the world’s major reserve currency, and long used to freedom of international capital movements, they generally treated exchange rate fluctuations with benign neglect. The Reagan administration made major tax cuts, and carried out significant measures of deregulation in the expectation that they would provoke a positive supply response that would outweigh potential inflationary consequences. The US operated with more flexible labour markets. Its capital market was better equipped to supply venture funds to innovators. Its economy was as big as Western Europe but much more closely integrated. Demand buoyancy was sustained by a stock market boom in the 1990s. The United States was a major gainer from the globalisation of international capital markets. In the postwar period until 1988, US foreign assets always exceeded liabilities, but thereafter its net foreign asset position moved from around zero to minus $1.5 trillion (more than 20 per cent of GDP). Thus the rest of the world helped to sustain the long American boom and financed the large US payments deficit (see Table 3–10).

On the other hand there was a very large rise in US imports which helped to sustain world demand. From 1973 to 1998 import volume rose faster than in Western Europe and Japan. Imports grew at a rate not much less than in 1950–73, whereas in most of Western Europe and Japan there was a substantial deceleration (see Table 3–11). The rise in US imports reflected the strength of demand, and the impact of successive tariff reductions under GATT and WTO auspices, as well as regional arrangements such as the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA). In spite of American success in maintaining high levels of demand and activity, economic growth has been slower since 1973 than in 1950–73. The main reason was a sharp deceleration in productivity growth. In 1950–73 labour productivity rose by 2.8 per cent a year. From 1973 to 1998, this fell to 1.5 per cent, which is slower than for any sustained period since 1870. Between 1913 and 1973, US total factor productivity growth (the response of output to the combined inputs of labour and capital) averaged 1.6 to 1.7 per cent a year. From 1973 to 1998 it grew at about a third of this pace. The productivity slowdown was masked by the improvement in use of potential, but has very serious implications for future growth if it continues, because it cannot continue to be offset by further improvements in the level of demand. The American slowdown probably contributed to slower productivity growth in other advanced capitalist countries which operate at levels of technology nearest to those in the United States. In the long run its impact would trickle down to poorer countries which operate at lower levels of technology. Many participants in the “new economy” (information technology and associated activities) find the notion of decelerating technical progress unacceptable. It has accelerated dramatically in computer and communications technology and they assume that there have been big spillover effects in the rest of the economy. They justify their position by anecdotal or microeconomic evidence for their favourite sector, and point to the huge increase in share prices on the Nasdaq stock market (which specialises in the “new” economy). However the impact of this technological “revolution” has not been apparent in the macroeconomic statistics until very recently. Nasdaq gives high valuations for many enterprises which have low or no profits, and fell nearly 50 per cent from its peak in the second half of 2000. New economy pundits argued that the national accounts statistics mismeasured growth. There was some truth in this because the traditional US growth estimates relied on fixed weights for a recent year to measure growth over a period of more than six decades. This did understate US growth compared with the weighting systems in vogue in Western Europe. In 1993, the traditional approach to GDP measurement was modified by presentation of two new alternative measures: a) one where the weights changed every five years (a procedure then used in most EU countries), and b) a chain index with weights changing every year (a procedure then officially adopted only in the Netherlands). The 5 year segmented index showed the fastest growth (0.28 per cent a year more than the traditional measure and 0.04 per cent faster than the chained index). In Maddison (1995 a) I used the 5 year segmented index as far as was then available (back to 1959). Since then, US national accounts statistics have been further modified in ways which show faster growth and a higher level of GDP. With the new measures, one still finds a marked productivity slowdown from 1973 to 1995, but for 1995–8 there has been an acceleration to rates not far below the golden age. For 1973–95 labour productivity grew at 1.4 per cent, and in 1995–8 at 2.5 per cent. This recent acceleration is largely attributable to the increased weight of the “new” economy. Box 3–1 provides a detailed analysis of these changes in US statistical procedure and their impact. It also demonstrates that they do, in some degree, exaggerate US growth and levels of performance compared with the more conservative approach in measuring the impact of the new economy in European countries and Japan. Recently, Jorgenson and Stiroh (2000) made an authoritative survey of US growth performance over the past four decades, using the revised GDP estimates. They found that accelerated technological change in computers and communications had its main impact in the production of these goods.

To facilitate comparison, I have converted BEA (1998) estimates from 1992 to 1990 dollars, BEA (1999 and 2000) from 1996 to 1990 dollars. Until the 1990s, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) published real GDP estimates back to 1929 with a single set of weights for the whole period. In 1993 it published three alternative estimates back to 1959: a) with old style fixed weights; b) a chain procedure where weights changed every year; c) asegmented index with weights changed every five years. In Maddison (1995 a) I used the third procedure for reasons of international comparability (it was then standard practice for EU countries). In column 1, I used the 5 year segmented weights for 1959–90; it showed growth 0.28 per cent faster than the fixed weights and 0.04 per cent faster than the chain weights. BEA 1998 (col. 2) did not provide alternatives but switched completely to chain weights back to 1929. BEA (1999) made further changes for 1959–98 (including treatment of computer software as investment). BEA (2000) carried the new estimates back to 1929.

The impact of the revisions on growth rates is shown in the above table. For 1950–73, the new measures show little difference from those I used in Maddison (1995 a). For 1973–98, BEA (1999), which I used in preparing the present study, shows growth about 0.3 percentage points higher than the old measure. However, the revisions for 1929–50 are much bigger. Their acceptance involves a major reinterpretation of American economic history. They imply a GDP level in 1929 16 per cent below the old index and would lower the level for earlier years correspondingly if used as a link. The 1913–50 growth of labour productivity would rise from 2.5 to 3 per cent a year and the 1913 level of labour productivity would be below that in the United Kingdom. The new BEA estimates also change the picture of the war and immediate postwar economy. It seems hazardous to use the new measures for 1929–50 without further investigation of the reasons why their impact is so big. One must also remember that no other country uses the chain index technique or hedonic price indices for such a long period in the past. Many West European countries have also made recent changes in methods of measuring macroeconomic growth. In particular, most of them have adopted the new SNA recommendations which involve treatment of computer software as investment. However these changes have generally been less far–reaching and have had a smaller impact on growth rates than in the United States. Most other OECD countries have not adopted chain weights and of those which have, only Australia, France and Norway have carried them back very far (France and Netherlands to 1978, Australia to 1960). Most other countries do not use hedonic price deflators (which make a quality adjustment for changing product characteristics). Hedonic price indices are not used in Belgium, Finland, Germany, Greece, Italy, Japan, Spain or the United Kingdom. Wyckoff (1995) contrasted the 13 per cent a year decline in the US price index for computers and office machinery from 1976 to 1993 with the 2 per cent a year fall in Germany for the same period for this category of goods. Most of the difference appears to have been due to the technique of index number construction. The World Economy in the Second Half of the Twentieth Century 139 

Productivity has continued to lag in the computer–using sectors. They state that “there is no evidence of spillovers from production of information technology to other industries — the empirical record provides little support for the ’new economy‘ picture of spillovers cascading from information technology producers on to users of this technology.” Oliner and Sichel (2000) reach more or less the same conclusion, as does Robert Gordon (2000), i.e. there has been a belated but positive payoff in macroeconomic productivity from a couple of decades of high investment in the “new economy”. The fact that there have been no very evident spillovers as yet in computer–using industries may well be due to the costs of absorbing new technologies which have involved a large input of highly trained people, rapid obsolescence of equipment and skills, and some serious blunders, such as those connected with the very costly Y2K scare. In the longer run, when the new technology has been fully assimilated, significant spillovers to other sectors of the economy may well occur. It is too early to judge whether recent productivity improvements portend a return to the pace the US achieved from 1913 to 1973, but there are grounds for hoping that progress may be faster than in 1973–95. 

Other Western Offshoots 

Australia has been the most buoyant of the other Western Offshoots. It enjoyed favourable results from substantial reduction of trade barriers, increased competition, and its proximity to the fast growing Asian countries. The growth record was much less favourable in Canada and New Zealand. 

Japan 

During the golden age, the pace of Japanese growth was much faster than in Western Europe. Per capita income increased sixfold from 1950 to 1973, growing at 8 per cent a year compared with 4 per cent in Western Europe. Labour productivity grew by 7.7 per cent a year, compared with 4.8 in Western Europe, total factor productivity at 5.1 per cent a year compared with 2.9 per cent. Japan did better than Western Europe for several reasons: a) its per capita income and productivity level in 1950 were little more than a third of the European level, so it had greater scope for exploiting opportunities of backwardness; b) the Japanese labour force already had an educational level not very different from the West European norm in 1950, and a huge reserve of technical skills acquired in military service which were fully available for peaceful pursuits; c) Japanese rates of investment were higher than in Western Europe; d) labour input per head of population was higher. A major reason for Japan’s capacity to mount such a large scale investment effort was the very high propensity to save in Japanese households. Horioka (1990) points to a number of complex reasons for this. They include traditional frugality which led to maintenance of modest lifestyles as income rose. Japanese had a high risk aversion and saved as a safeguard against illness and unforeseen risks. The smaller importance of social security than in Europe led to bigger private provision for old age. The significant role of remuneration in the form of twice–yearly lump–sum bonuses and relative scarcity of consumer credit were also contributory factors. The Japanese catch–up effort was bolstered in unusual degree by government policy. Dedication to this goal was deeply rooted. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Tokugawa regime sought successfully to catch up with and overtake Chinese levels of income. From 1868 onwards the objective was to catch up with the West. The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 140 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

In the postwar period, the developmentalist objective was pursued by a comprehensive interactive network of interest groups. There were close solidaristic links between Japan’s highly educated bureaucratic elite, politicians of the Liberal Democratic party (in power with one brief interruption since 1955), big business and the banking system. Japan’s large corporate groups ( keiretsu )and banks had close interlocking financial ties. Large corporations often had long–standing symbiotic links with smaller firms. Japanese trade unions were organised on a company basis, workers had long–term job security, and identified their interests with those of their employers. The most successful members of the bureaucratic elite frequently moved into political office or careers of business leadership. MITI (the Ministry of Trade and Industry) provided “administrative guidance” to firms and banks which influenced the allocation of resources to what were considered key industries in terms of growth opportunities or export markets. The consensual character of all these relationships is reflected in the negligible importance of litigation or lawyers. In the Tokugawa period, foreign trade was tightly controlled in a policy of seclusion ( sakoku ), designed to prevent foreign interference in Japan. In the postwar period trade was more open but the old autarkic emphasis remained. The government played a key role in promoting technological development, and assimilation of foreign technology, using techniques which preserved national independence. Foreign investment in Japan was very limited, and still is. Weak sectors, and some strong ones, were protected by a variety of restrictions on imports. Although this version of capitalism was highly effective in producing rapid growth and high levels of per capita product it was more costly than it might have been with greater use of market forces, greater representation of consumer interests, and greater openness to foreign trade. By the early 1990s Japan had a capital stock per worker nearly a quarter higher than in Western Europe, but its productivity was substantially lower. Workers and “salarymen” worked very long hours and had little time for holidays. There was much greater unevenness of performance in different sectors than is normal for advanced capitalist countries — with very low productivity in agriculture and distribution, and a world leadership position in autos, steel, machine tools and consumer electronics. In Japan, as in Western Europe, it was inevitable that the rate of growth would decline after 1973, and likely that the slowdown would be sharper, given the greater success in the golden age. The slowdown was indeed sharp, though per capita GDP and productivity grew faster in Japan than in Western Europe from 1973 to 1990. Thereafter things deteriorated badly. Per capita product rose only 1 per cent a year in 1990–98. Japan was clearly working below potential. High Japanese investment rates continued in the 1970s and 1980s, and high expectations led to a boom in asset prices. But as the growth potential weakened there were diminishing returns and falling profits. This contributed to a collapse in share prices in 1989–92 from which Japan has not recovered. The Nikkei share price index in 1999 was at half its 1989 level compared with a fourfold rise in the United States, and a two–and–a–half–fold increase in Western Europe. The stock price collapse was compounded by a fall in the price of residential land by a third from 1990 to 1998. This was proportionately more important than the stock market collapse. Household net worth of all kinds in Japan was 8.5 times as high as disposable income in 1990 and fell to 6.5 in 1998. In the same period the US ratio rose from 4.8 to 5.9, the German from 5.2 to 5.4, the French from 4.2 to 5.2. The collapse in Japanese profits and asset values created a very deflationary situation. Consumers became extremely cautious in their spending. Many businesses became insolvent or bankrupt and banks found themselves with massive non–performing assets. This restricted their willingness and ability to extend new credits. The rate of price increase fell to 0.6 per cent a year in 1994–98. The World Economy in the Second Half of the Twentieth Century 141 

The government responded to this situation by a massive increase in extravagant public works rather than tax reduction. The Bank of Japan’s discount rate fell nine steps from 6 per cent in 1991 to 0.5 per cent in 1995 and remained there for nearly five years. The interbank loan rate was virtually zero for two years from 1998. The government moved very slowly to clear up the mess in the financial system. It aggravated the long term problem by giving financial aid to institutions which should have been allowed to go bankrupt. Government measures prevented a major collapse in the economy, but they failed to revive demand. The Japanese slowdown was transmitted to the rest of the world in two ways. Import growth was depressed but capital exports increased. Japan’s high rate of saving continued but a larger share went to capital exports. Between 1990 and 1998 its net foreign assets rose from 10 to 30 per cent of GDP. Its impact on the world economy was a mirror image of that of the United States (see Table 3–10).

II R ESURGENT A SIA 

In the half century since 1950, Asia has been the fastest growing part of the world economy, outperforming all other regions. This was in stark contrast with past experience. In the four and a half centuries from 1500 to 1950, Asia stagnated whilst all other regions progressed. In 1500 Asia accounted for 65 per cent of world GDP, and only 18.5 per cent in 1950. Since 1950, the Asian share has doubled. In 1950–73, Japan had supergrowth, with per capita income rising over 8 per cent a year compared with the 2.6 per cent for resurgent Asia. In 1973–99 as a whole, per capita growth in resurgent Asia was twice as fast as in Japan. In the 1990s it was four times as fast. Resurgent Asia consists of the 15 countries shown in Table 3–14. Seven of these (China, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand) have been the most dynamic element in the world economy. Four now have a per capita income within the West European range. In 1999, the group had an aggregate income of 5.8 trillion international 1990 (PPP adjusted) dollars (not far below the aggregate for the 12 core countries of Western Europe, and more than double Japanese GDP of $2.6 trillion). There are eight countries in a second group with an aggregate GDP of $3.1 trillion (more than twice as big as Germany). They have lower per capita income than the first group, and for 1950–99 as a whole their per capita growth rate was half as fast, at 2.2 per cent a year. Since 1973, their growth rate has been faster than in any part of the world outside Asia. Table 3–15 indicates some proximate causes of Asia’s growth. Within each category the countries are ranked in descending order of income level. The averages for each category are arithmetic, in contrast to the weighted averages in Table 3–14. The supergrowth countries in the first group had high investment ratios. The combination of high investment rates and rapid GDP growth means that their physical capital stock was growing more rapidly than in other parts of the world. They also had a relatively high ratio of employment to population. This was partly due to a demographic transition with falling fertility and a rising share of population of working age, but also to the traditionally high labour mobilisation that characterises multicropping rice economies. In all cases which are documented they also had high rates of improvement in the quality of human capital (see Maddison 1995a for estimates of education levels). Equally striking was the rapid growth of exports and the high ratios of exports to GDP. This latter characteristic is in striking contrast to the Japanese model of development. Another contrast with Japan is the willingness of these countries to attract foreign direct investment as a vehicle for assimilation of foreign technology (see Table 3–16). Countries in the second group have on average much lower income levels than the first, lower investment rates, lower ratios of labour mobilisation and less openness to international trade. To some extent, Their slower growth suggests that “opportunities of backwardness” are not inversely related to income level. The ability to mount a successful process of catch–up seems to be greatest at somewhat higher levels of income. It is difficult to draw sharp conclusions on the role of policy in the seven most successful countries, because their policy mix has been rather heterogeneous. Three of the supergrowth countries are market oriented, open, highly competitive capitalist countries. Hong Kong comes closest to being completely driven by market forces, but its dynamism is also attributable to special circumstances. It was an unusually privileged entrepôt for trade and financial transactions between China and the rest of the world during the US embargo of 1952–73. It still benefits as an intermediary for trade between the Chinese mainland and Taiwan. Its low tax regime is partly attributable to the fact that the government has large revenues from monopoly ownership of The World Economy in the Second Half of the Twentieth Century 143 

undeveloped land. It has access to an enormous pool of cheap labour on its doorstep. It has benefited from very large direct investment from abroad (see Table 3–16), and has made heavy investment in China’s neighbouring enterprise zones where its stock of direct investment totalled $155 billion in 1998. In this situation, laisser faire worked wonders in achieving efficient resource allocation. In 1997, sovereignty reverted to China, but the nature of economic institutions and policy were not changed. The reasons for Singapore’s ascension resemble those operative in Hong Kong. It is a strategically placed city state with a vocation for entrepôt trade, but its growth got a bigger push from government. Its enlightened authoritarian regime pursued a policy of promoting high savings, improvement of education, encouraging exports and the acquisition of foreign technology. It benefited even more than Hong Kong from foreign direct investment (see Table 3–16). As its own manufacturing production grew more sophisticated, and labour costs rose, it became a major capital exporter, supporting partner enterprises in neighbouring countries. In 1998 its own stock of direct investment abroad was $48 billion. The third country which is now a market oriented open capitalist economy is Taiwan . Its industry is characterised by highly competitive small scale firms with easy freedom of entry, and government willingness to let the failures go bankrupt. In the past two decades, as its manufacturing products became more sophisticated and labour costs rose, domestic investment ratios have fallen and there has been a substantial direct investment abroad, particularly in China. In 1998, its stock of foreign direct investment abroad was $38 billion. The government has maintained very large exchange reserves, as a hedge against its relative political isolation.

China has totally different institutions and policy. Until 1978 virtually the whole economy was under state ownership and control. Economic performance was much better than in the past and the economic structure was transformed. The acceleration was due to a massive increase in inputs of physical and human capital, but there were self–inflicted wounds from the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. For most of the Maoist period there was little contact with the outside world. From 1952 to 1973 the United States applied a comprehensive embargo on trade, travel and financial transactions, and from 1960 onwards the USSR did the same. Allocation of resources was extremely inefficient. China grew more slowly than other communist economies and somewhat less than the world average. Since 1978, Chinese performance has been transformed by liberalisation of the economy. The relaxation of state control in agriculture was a massive success. There was a huge expansion in small–scale industry, particularly in rural areas. The rigid monopoly of foreign trade and the policy of autarkic self–reliance were abandoned after 1978. Foreign trade decisions were decentralised. The yuan was devalued and China became highly competitive. Special enterprise zones were created as free trade areas. In response to the greater role for market forces, competition emerged, resource allocation improved, and consumer satisfaction increased. There was a massive increase in interaction with the world economy through trade, inflows of direct investment, a very large increase in opportunities for study and travel abroad, and for foreigners to visit China. At the same time, China was prudent in retaining control over the more volatile types of international capital movement. Although it has had to wait 15 years to be admitted to the World Trade Organisation, it is, together with Hong Kong, the world’s fourth largest exporter. Table 3–15.

As a result China has had one of the fastest rates of growth of per capita GDP, and its growth path has been more stable since the 1970s than most of Asia. Its success is in striking contrast to the collapse of activity in the former USSR. China still has some important problems to solve. It needs to shut down a large proportion of state industrial enterprises which are a hangover from the Maoist period. Most of them make substantial losses. They are kept in operation by government subsidy and default on loans which the state banks are constrained to give them. The relative importance of these enterprises is declining significantly. In 1996 43 million people were employed in the state industrial sector. By 1999 this had fallen to 24 million. Public employment in wholesale and retail trade and restaurants fell from 10.6 million to 6.0 million in the same period. Another major (and related) problem is the large volume of non–performing loans in the banking sector which is largely controlled by the state. The importance of non–performing loans is smaller than in Japan, but the state does not make efficient allocation of the large funds which it captures from savers and the rapidly burgeoning private sector is starved of funds. 

Korea’s institutions and policy mix have been somewhat like those of Japan, with close interaction between government and large industrial conglomerates on strategic decisions. There has been a substantial liberalisation of the system in the past decade, with a reduced role for government. A major difference from Japan has been the high export orientation of the economy.

Korea succeeded in achieving the fastest growth of per capita income in Asia and the world over the past half century. From 1950–73 it grew at 5.8 per cent a year, and from 1973–99 at 6.1 per cent. In the first of these periods it grew more slowly than Japan, in the second more than twice as fast. This was achieved despite very high military expenditure. In 1998, there was a severe recession with a 6.7 per cent fall in per capita income. This was caused by flight of foreign short term capital in the Asian financial crises of that year. But Korea has a history of successful accommodation to external shocks, and in 1999 per capita income bounced up by 9.6 per cent. As in other Asian countries, the crisis was in large part a consequence of liberalisation of capital transactions in the early 1990s. There were large short term inflows from foreign investors seeking quick gains in a booming economy. The incentive to make such investments was particularly strong for Japanese investors whose own economy was stagnating, whose returns on equity investment were negative and on fixed rate securities virtually zero. In 1997–98, Korea was overexposed to changes in the expectations of foreign short term investors. They were panicked into sudden withdrawal of funds by the contagion effect of the crisis in Thailand. The 1998 Korean crisis was overcome by substantial borrowing from the IMF, some degree of deflation in policy and the depressing effect of a temporary collapse in profits, stock prices and the exchange rate. There have been some beneficial effects of the crisis. The government is likely to be more cautious in encouraging the more volatile kind of capital inflow. It has moved to encourage bigger flows of foreign direct investment, pushed some of the large conglomerates ( chaebol ) to sell off distressed assets. The banking system has a significant portfolio of non–performing loans but these are proportionately smaller than in Japan.

The 1997–98 recession had a serious impact in several Asian countries (see Table 3–17). The adverse effects were greatest in Indonesia where GDP per capita fell by one seventh in 1998. Bankruptcy and the social and political aftermath were much deeper than elsewhere, with negligible signs of recovery. The growth performance of Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand was also seriously interrupted. The basic cause was the reversal of massive short term capital inflows which had poured into the region in 1995–97 because of euphoria induced by rapid growth and liberalisation of capital movements (see Table 3–19). All of these countries have made some degree of recovery, but it is too early to assess the degree of damage to their long run growth momentum.

There are six East Asian economies (Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia, North Korea and Vietnam) where economic performance since 1950 has been considerably worse than in the rest of Asia, and where income levels are relatively low. Most of these were run for a lengthy period on communist lines, and economic advance was seriously interrupted by war. The worst cases are North Korea and Mongolia which were closely integrated in the Soviet orbit, and where aid and trade were disrupted after the collapse of the USSR in 1991. North Korea is an isolated outpost of Stalinism and has suffered the worst. Mongolia has privatised and marketised its economy and suffers from problems of transition which seem to be smaller than in some of the Asian successor states of the former USSR (see part VI below). Afghanistan has been shattered by foreign invasion and civil war and now has the lowest per capita income in Asia. Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam are making a more successful transition than the successor states of the USSR. Table 3–19.

West Asia consists of 15 economies. Ten of these are significant oil producers. The importance of oil helps to explain why they have relatively high per capita incomes, and why their growth momentum has differed from that in most of Asia. Per capita income of the oil producers in 1950 was much higher than in prewar years, and higher than in the rest of Asia. Oil production was 16 million metric tons in 1937, 86 million in 1950, and 1 054 million in 1973 — an increase of 11.5 per cent a year from 1950–1973. OPEC action in raising prices and restricting supply meant that aggregate oil production of West Asia was about the same in 1999 as in 1973 (see Table 3–21). Growth was significantly affected by war in Iraq, Iran, Israel, Kuwait, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria and Yemen. The aggregate GDP of this group was about 10 per cent of the Asian total in 1998. It should be noted that our measure of real GDP per capita is in 1990 prices, and is not adjusted for changes in terms of trade. For most countries this is not important in assessing long term economic performance, but where exports are heavily concentrated on one commodity and prices are highly volatile, these movements are important. The average price of a barrel of crude oil quadrupled from 1972 to 1974. From 1978 to 1980 it rose nearly threefold. Between mid–1997 and mid–1998, it fell by half. At mid–year 2000 it was three times as high as in mid–1998. Table 3–21. World Production of Crude Oil and Natural Gas, 1950–99

Another feature of the oil producing countries has been extremely rapid population growth as prosperity created a huge demand for foreign workers. Thus the population of Qatar increased 28– fold from 1950 to 1998, UAE 32–fold, Kuwait 13–fold, Saudi Arabia fivefold. 

VL ATIN A MERICA 

In Latin America, the Bretton Woods collapse and the acceleration of inflation in the early 1970s did not have the same effect on the policy–making establishment that it did in Europe. Most countries had never seriously tried to observe the fixed rate discipline of Bretton Woods. National currencies had been repeatedly devalued, IMF advocacy of fiscal and monetary rectitude had been frequently rebuffed, high rates of inflation had become endemic. The new disturbances were generally viewed as variations on a familiar theme. The acceleration of inflation was not regarded as a razor’s edge situation, calling for drastic policy reorientation. The OPEC shock was important for Brazil as a large energy importer, but it brought windfall profits to oil exporting Mexico, Colombia and Venezuela, and was fairly neutral for self sufficient oil producers like Argentina, Chile and Peru. Hence most countries reacted with insouciance to the worldwide explosion of prices, and governments felt that they could accommodate high rates of inflation. They were able to borrow on a large scale at negative real interest rates to cover external deficits incurred as a result of expansionary policies. As a result their GDP growth rate from 1973 to 1980 did not decelerate. However, the basic parameters had changed by the early 1980s. By then, the OECD countries were pushing anti–inflationary policy very vigorously. The change to restrictive monetary policy initiated by the United States Federal Reserve pushed up interest rates suddenly and sharply. The dollar appreciated and world export prices began to fall. The average real interest cost of floating rate dollar debt rose to nearly 16 per cent in 1981–83 compared with minus 8.7 per cent in 1977– 80. Between 1973 and 1982 external debt had increased sevenfold and the creditworthiness of Latin America as a whole was grievously damaged by Mexico’s debt delinquency in 1982. The flow of voluntary private lending stopped abruptly, and created a massive need for retrenchment in economies teetering on the edge of hyperinflation and fiscal crisis. In most countries resource allocation was distorted by subsidies, controls, widespread commitments to government enterprise, and detailed interventionism. Most of them also had serious social tension, and several had unsavoury political regimes. In the 1930s, most of the Latin American countries resorted to debt default. This path was pursued by some (Bolivia and Peru), but it was not a very attractive option in the 1980s. World trade had not collapsed, international private lending continued on a large scale. The IMF and World Bank had substantial facilities to mitigate the situation, and leverage to pressure Western banks to make involuntary loans and legitimate a substantial degree of delinquency. In the course of the 1980s, attempts to resolve these problems brought major changes in economic policy. But in most countries, the changes were made reluctantly. After experiments with heterodox policy options in Argentina and Brazil, most countries eventually embraced the neoliberal policy mix pioneered by Chile. They moved towards more market oriented policy, greater openness to international markets, reduced government intervention, trade liberalisation, less distorted exchange rates, better fiscal equilibrium and establishment of more democratic political systems. In economic terms, the cost of this transition was a decade of falling per capita income. After 1990, economic growth revived substantially but the process was interrupted by contagious episodes of capital flight. The first occurred in 1995 as a reaction to the Mexican debt crisis, the second in 1998 as a reaction to Russian debt default. Growth performance in the 1990s has been disappointing, considering the scope for recovery after the lost decade of the 1980s.

per capita income in Latin America has risen by less than 0.3 per cent a year compared with over 2.5 per cent from 1950 to 1980. The earlier growth rate implied a doubling of per capita income every 28 years, the 1980–99 rate implies income doubling over 250 years. Some idea of the difficulties and costs involved in switching policy regimes can be gained by detailed scrutiny of Chilean experience, where the transformation has been most complete. 

The Chilean Paradigm 

Chile is the economy with the longest history of substantial inflation. From 1880 to 1913, the annual price rise averaged 5.6 per cent, in 1913–50, 8.3 per cent, in 1950–73 48.1 per cent. Chile was the heartland of the “structuralist” school which argued that economic rigidities made orthodox monetary remedies inapplicable to its inflationary problems. They argued that inflation could be mitigated by institutional reform, but basically one had to cohabit with it, tolerate or even use it as a positive instrument of policy. Economists of this school also had an instrumental bias towards detailed regulation and subsidies, exchange and trade controls, plus administered internal prices. These views led to early clashes with IMF orthodoxy in the 1950s. The Allende administration which took over in 1970 was an ideological melange of structuralism, Marxism and a dash of Peronist–style populism. Its policy of nationalising foreign copper interests, increasing social expenditure, land reform and takeover of private business enterprises sapped investor confidence and lowered production at the same time as expansionary fiscal and monetary policies accelerated inflation. The military who overthrew Allende in 1973 made a complete reversal of policy. They were substantially influenced and aided by Chicago University economists, who saw an opportunity for experiments with monetarism and laisser faire in a regime whose “credibility” was high because of its brutal hold on state power. The new regime privatised the economy, restored land to previous owners, sold 472 of the 507 state enterprises cheaply, and gave gratuities to foreign copper interests deemed to have been inadequately compensated by Allende. In order to break inflationary momentum shock treatment was applied — curbing public expenditure by a quarter, cutting the tariff level from 94 to 10 per cent, devaluing massively, abolishing exchange controls, suppressing trade union rights, tightening monetary policy, raising indirect taxes and lowering taxes on capital and profits. As a consequence per capita GDP fell by 24 per cent from 1971 to 1975. The rate of inflation was reduced to 375 per cent in 1975 but by 1982 it had fallen to 10 per cent. After 1975, economic growth resumed, but there was another big recession from 1981 to 1983 when per capita GDP fell by 14 per cent. This setback was due to two major policy errors. Around 1979, the emphasis in monetarist thinking moved away from controlling domestic monetary supply to fixed exchange rates which were expected to constrain domestic inflation to world rates. However, stable exchange rates and falling prices of copper exports in 1979–81 led to a very big current payments deficit (about 15 per cent of GDP), so the exchange rate was allowed to float sharply downwards. The fall in the peso had major repercussions for the banks and financieras which had been sold back to private ownership subject to very lax supervision. These institutions made losses which they covered by heavy borrowing abroad. At the new exchange rate they could not service their debts. The government bailed them out and accepted responsibility for all their foreign debts. In this blundering way, there was a significant return to widespread public ownership and control of financial and productive assets (and liabilities). The World Economy in the Second Half of the Twentieth Century 155 

After this episode the government managed to return to a more respectable growth path, swapped a quarter of the foreign debt for equity, subjected international capital movement to control, and after a short episode of higher tariffs, returned, in chastened mood, to a policy of budget balance, low inflation, floating exchange rates, and a judicious reprivatisation of government assets. In 1990 the country returned to democratic government. The three successive civilian administrations of Aylwin, Frei, and Lagos have made no basic change to the neoliberal policy mix which they inherited, and in the 1990s it worked reasonably well for them. 

VI T HE T RANSITION P ROCESS IN THE F ORMER USSR AND E ASTERN E UROPE a) Successor States of the Former Soviet Union 

15 successor states emerged from the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991. In all of them, there had already been a very marked deceleration of economic growth in 1973–90. The reasons for the slowdown (or in some cases, decline) were very different from those in Western Europe. The USSR was relatively isolated from the world economy, and insulated from the inflationary shocks and speculative capital movements which induced caution in Western policy. There was no unemployment, and as the productivity level was less than half of that in Western Europe, the erosion of once–for–all catch–up factors should not have been operative in the USSR. What was most striking after 1973 was that total factor productivity became substantially negative, with labour productivity slowing down dramatically and capital productivity very negative indeed (see Maddison, 1989 a, pp. 100–2). There were three major reasons for the slowdown. One was the decrease in microeconomic efficiency, the second was the increased burden of military expenditure and associated spending. The third was depletion of natural resource advantages, or their destruction by ecological horrors. The deficiencies in resource allocation were manifest. Average and incremental capital/output ratios were higher than in capitalist countries. Materials were used wastefully as they were supplied below cost. Shortages created a chronic tendency to hoard inventories. The steel consumption/GDP ratio was four times as high as in the United States, the ratio of industrial value added to gross output much lower than in Western countries. In the USSR, the average industrial firm had 814 workers in 1987 compared with an average of 30 in Germany and the United Kingdom. Transfer of technology from the West was hindered by trade restrictions, lack of foreign direct investment and very restricted access to foreign technicians and scholars. Work incentives were poor, malingering on the job was commonplace. The low wages which the system offered had a dulling effect on work incentives. The quality of consumer goods was poor. Retail outlets and service industries were few. Prices bore little relation to cost. Bread, butter and housing were heavily subsidised. Consumers wasted time queueing, bartering or sometimes bribing their way to the goods and services they wanted. There was an active black market, and special shops for the nomenklatura . There was increasing cynicism, frustration, growing alcoholism and a decline in life expectation. Soviet spending on its military and space effort was around 15 per cent of GDP in the 1970s and 1980s, nearly three times the US ratio and five times as high as in Western Europe. There were significant associated commitments to Afghanistan, Cuba, Mongolia, North Korea, Vietnam and Soviet client states in Africa.

There were increased real costs in exploiting natural resources. In the 1950s a good deal of agricultural expansion was in virgin soil areas, whose fertility was quickly exhausted. Most of the Aral Sea was transformed into a salty desert. Exploitation of mineral and energy resources in Siberia and Central Asia required bigger infrastructure costs than in European Russia. The Chernobyl nuclear accident had a disastrously polluting effect on a large area of the Ukraine. In 1985–90 Gorbachev established a remarkable degree of political freedom, liberated Eastern Europe and disabled the command economy, but did little to change the economic system. Yeltsin (end 1991 to end 1999) created a market economy and broke up the Soviet Union. Yeltsin’s major initial concerns were to destroy the Soviet economic and political system. The USSR was dissolved at a clandestine meeting of Yeltsin as President of Russia, Kravchuk from the Ukraine and Shuskevich of Belarus early in December 1991. The Baltic states were left free to pursue the capitalist path. The old party bosses of the Asian republics had no prior warning, or ideas for change, but acquiesced, became presidents and entered into a loose federation (the Commonwealth of Independent States). The Soviet Communist Party was dissolved and its assets seized. Table 3–23. Per Capita Growth Performance in Former USSR and Eastern Europe, 1950–98

The World Economy in the Second Half of the Twentieth Century 157 

In the Russian republic a government of radical young economic reformers was installed in January 1992, who jettisoned the old command structure, freed most domestic prices, removed obstacles to foreign trade, cut the military budget to a fraction of its earlier level, abolished state trading, legalised all forms of private trading, and began a process of privatisation which eventually sold off most state enterprises at knockdown prices. Between 1990 and 1998, proceeds from Russian privatisation totalled $7.5 billion compared with Brazilian privatisation receipts of $66.7 billion in the same period. The average GDP of these two economies was similar over these years, but Brazilian sales were a very much smaller fraction of its capital stock (see World Bank, 2000, pp. 186-7). The transition to a market economy was made rather quickly, but the economic outcome was a downward spiral of real income for the mass of the population which lasted almost a decade. In the Russian republic, GDP was 42 per cent lower in 1998 than in 1990. Fixed investment fell precipitously to 17.5 per cent of its 1990 level. There was a big drop in government military spending, so the fall in Table 3–25. Per Cent of Population in Poverty in Former USSR and Eastern Europe, 1987–88 and 1993–95

real private consumption per capita was much milder (about 10 per cent) than in per capita GDP. In Belarus it fell by a fifth (see Table 3–24). The situation in the Ukraine was a good deal worse, with a 44 per cent fall in per capita consumption. The transition to capitalism involved very big changes in income distribution. Under the old system, basic necessities (bread, housing, education, health, crèches and social services) had been highly subsidised by the government or provided free by state enterprises to their workers. These all became relatively more expensive, the real value of wages and pensions was reduced by hyperinflation, and the value of popular savings was destroyed. There were welfare gains from the ending of queueing, the improvement in quality and variety of consumer goods which came from freedom to import, but enjoyment of such gains was felt mainly by people able to succeed in the market economy. Branko Milanovic recently estimated changes in the incidence of poverty (see Table 3–25). Between 1987–8 and 1993–5, the poverty ratio in four “Western” CIS countries (whose combined population was 212 million in 1998) had risen from 2 per cent to over half their total population. In four Central Asian states (with a combined population of 49 million), the ratio rose from 15 to 66 per cent, and in the three Baltic States from 1 to 29 per cent. This was much worse than the experience of Central and Southeast Europe, where the only country in a similar situation was Romania. Supplementary evidence of increased impoverishment is evident in reduced life expectation, reduced school attendance, and increased unemployment, though the latter was mitigated by the fact that many workers retained ties with enterprises which provided social benefits, even when their wages had stopped. There are two major reasons why the transition was more painful in the former USSR than in Eastern Europe. One was the weakness of monetary and fiscal policy which led to hyperinflation. The other was what the EBRD calls the “capture” of the state by a new business oligarchy. Both of these were serious impediments to efficient resource allocation and helped to channel income to a privileged elite.

Macroeconomic Instability 

Table 3–26 shows the average rate of inflation in 1990–94, and 1994–98. The first wave of hyperinflation has now been significantly tempered, but the momentum of price increase is still very much higher than the 2 per cent a year in Western capitalist economies (see Table 3–8). In the Baltics and Eastern Europe it is now similar to that in Latin America (13.5 per cent, see Table 3–22). A bout of hyperinflation was an understandable consequence of the switch from the price structure of a command economy to one governed by market forces, but inflationary momentum was fed by fiscal weakness. This was inevitable in a state which previously derived its income from ownership of assets which had been sold for a song. It was also very difficult to devise and implement a new tax apparatus in an economy where enterprises had rapidly become adept at tax avoidance, tax evasion, concealment of profits at home and in foreign tax havens. In Russia the problem was exacerbated by devolution of spending power to 19 constituent republics and 61 other regional administrations. Reckless monetary policy was the other major contributor to hyperinflation. In the first reformist phase, the Gaidar government took the advice of international agencies and maintained the rouble as a common currency for the CIS member states until 1993. Thus it had to cover their deficits which amounted to 10 per cent of Russian GDP. Between 1992 and 1994 hyperinflation was fuelled by an enormous increase in the volume of credits at negative real interest rates by the Central Bank to cover the federal budget deficit and to prop up enterprises that should have been forced into bankruptcy. At a later stage, deficits were financed by developing a Treasury Bill market and borrowing abroad. After the re–election of Yeltsin in July 1996, there was a large inflow of foreign investment in Russian equities and Treasury Bills. The stock market rose threefold from mid–1996 to the end of 1997 without much change in the exchange rate. Many foreign investors speculated heavily, hedging the exchange risk by buying forward dollar contracts from Russian banks. The dismissal of prime minister Chernomyrdin in 1998 and the Asian financial crisis caused large withdrawals of foreign funds. The Russian government propped up the exchange rate for a couple of weeks with nearly $5 billion from the IMF, but in mid–August 1998 devalued, defaulted on much of domestic debt and declared a moratorium on debt repayments to foreigners by Russian companies and banks. 

The Rise of a New Financial Oligarchy 

The other major problem with the Russian transition to capitalism was diagnosed by the EBRD (1999, pp. 110–11) as follows: “under the ‘shares for loans’ scheme implemented in 1995, many of the key resource–based companies fell into the hands of a small group of financiers, the so–called ’oligarchs‘. This has led to very sharp increases in wealth and income inequality — by 1997 the Gini coefficient for income in Russia was around 0.5, a level comparable to those in Colombia or Malaysia. It has also helped to create an investment climate marked by corruption, non–transparent business practices — including barter — and cronyism.” “Not only has income inequality increased substantially but spending on social benefits has actually become regressive over the course of the transition. This highlights the capture of the state by narrow interest groups.” There has been legislation to establish Western style property rights, but in practice accountancy is opaque and government interpretation of property rights is arbitrary. Many businesses are subject to criminal pressure. Property owners such as shareholders or investors are uncertain whether their rights will be honoured. Workers are not sure that their wages will be paid. These characteristics make resource allocation very inefficient.

A third major failure of transition policy was the treatment of agriculture. In Russia and the Ukraine, 1998 agricultural output was 42 per cent lower than in 1990. This is in startling contrast to China where agricultural output rose 56 per cent in the seven years following the 1978 reforms. Virtually nothing has been done to create dynamism in this backward sector, where effective action is difficult because of the heritage of the past. As Kornai (1992, p. 437) put it: “To this day the Soviet peasantry has not been able to get over the ghastly trauma of collectivisation. Even though the people who experienced it are no longer alive, their children and grandchildren feel there is no security for private property, and the land may be taken from them again. If they were to become prosperous farmers by farming individually, it could mean that they would be branded as kulaks 

again, which could bring persecution, deportation or death.” 

b) East European Countries 

The economic system of the East European countries was similar to that of the former USSR until the end of the 1980s, and so was its macroeconomic performance. In the golden age, 1950–73, East European per capita GDP growth (like that of the USSR) more or less kept pace with that in Western Europe. From 1973 to 1990, it faltered badly as the economic and political system began to crumble, with aggregate per capita growth of about 0.5 per cent per annum compared with 1.9 in Western Europe. Since 1990, East Europe has experienced major problems in the transition to capitalism, but the process has been much less traumatic than in the former USSR. Average per capita income in 1998 was similar to that in 1990, whereas it was more than 40 per cent lower in the former USSR. There are in fact big differences in the success of the transition in different East European countries. Poland, by far the biggest economy and the worst performer in 1973–90, has had more rapid income growth since 1990 than any other European country except Ireland. The Czech and Slovak republics and Hungary have more or less recovered their 1990 levels of per capita income. The worst case is the former Yugoslavia which split into five separate states in the course of bloody conflicts. Bulgaria and Romania have also fared badly, in part because their economies were severely affected in various ways by wars in Bosnia and Kosovo, sanctions on Yugoslavia, and bombing of bridges on the Danube. With the exception of Poland, economic performance has been disappointing. Given the fact that average per capita income in Eastern Europe is about 30 per cent of that in West Europe, there should have been scope for some degree of catch–up. In fact the problems of transition are very profound. The easiest part was the freeing of prices and the opening of trade with the West. This ended shortages and queueing, improved the quality of goods available and increased consumer welfare in ways not properly captured in the GDP measures. However, much of the old capital stock became junk, the labour force needed to acquire new skills, the legal and administrative system and the tax/social benefit structure had to be transformed, and the distributive and banking system had to be rebuilt from scratch. It is interesting to compare the situation in Eastern Europe with that in East Germany, which was incorporated into the Bundesrepublik in 1990. In other East European countries, the amount of Western aid has been relatively modest, and their access to Western markets is hampered by the EU’s common agricultural policy and restraints on exports of sensitive industrial products. The Länder of East Germany, by contrast, have had completely free access to German and Western markets and have received transfers of various kinds of about a trillion dollars since reunification, but per capita product and labour productivity are still less than half the levels in the rest of Germany. The problem of transforming socialist firms into productive capitalist enterprises was more pronounced than elsewhere because East Germany was incorporated in a monetary union which greatly overvalued the old Ost Mark wages and assets. Most of the industrial capital stock has been scrapped. Employment is down by 30 per cent since 1990, as workers (as well as pensioners and other social categories) became eligible for much higher social security benefits. The World Economy in the Second Half of the Twentieth Century 161 

The reasons why Eastern European countries have performed better than the states of the former USSR seem to be mainly as follows: 

a) the exposure to the command economy was shorter, about 40 years, as compared with more than 70 in most of the former USSR. This was also true of the Baltic countries, which have been more successful than the other economies of the former USSR; 

b) in several of the East European countries, there had been strong aspirations to break away from the command economy and Soviet hegemony — in Yugoslavia in the 1950s, in Hungary in 1956, in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and in Poland in the 1980s — and there was an active intellectual interest in problems of transition. Yugoslavia, Hungary and Poland were members of the IMF before the collapse of the Soviet system, and had acquired some knowledge of the macroeconomic policy mix and weaponry characteristic of capitalist economies. In the case of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary and Slovenia, there was greater propinquity to and knowledge of Western capitalism than in the former USSR, Bulgaria or Romania; 

c) there was much greater concern to carry out transition policies within a framework of macroeconomic stability in Eastern Europe than in the former USSR. This is particularly true of Poland which started its radical reforms at the beginning of 1990 with an overhang of inflationary pressure engendered by wage indexation and other concessions to the militant trade unionism of the Solidarity movement (see Balcerowicz, 1995, pp. 324–6). Reform policy involved tight monetary and fiscal discipline; 

d) the reform process gave much greater emphasis to creating a transparent legal basis for contracts and property rights, and the privatisation process did not create a new oligarchy of predatory capitalists. Here again, the difference between policy in Poland and in the former Soviet Union is strongly emphasised by Balcerowicz, the main architect of the Polish reforms. As a result there was much less ambiguity about the direction and destination of the reform process. 

VII A FRICA 

Africa has nearly 13 per cent of world population, but only 3 per cent of world GDP. It is the world’s poorest region, with a 1998 per capita income only 5 per cent of that in the richest region, less than half of that in Asia (excluding Japan). It has the lowest life expectation (52 years compared with 78 in Western Europe). It has the most rapid demographic expansion — about nine times as fast as in Western Europe. As a result of rapid population growth, age structure is very different from that in Western Europe. In Europe more than two thirds are of working age, in Africa little more than half. 43 per cent of Africans are below 15 years old and 3 per cent 65 or over. In Western Europe 18 per cent are under 15 and 15 per cent 65 or older. Almost half the adult population of Africa are illiterate. They have a high incidence of infectious and parasitic disease (malaria, sleeping sickness, hookworm, river blindness, yellow fever). Over two thirds of HIV infected people live in Africa. As a result the quantity and quality of labour input per head of population is much lower than in other parts of the world. African economies are more volatile than most others, because their export earnings are concentrated on a few primary commodities, and extremes of weather (droughts and floods) are more severe and have a heavy impact. Although African levels of performance are low in comparative terms, there has been economic growth in the capitalist epoch. Per capita income rose about 3.5–fold from 1820 to 1980 (see Tables 3–1b and C5–c), which is about the same as in Asia (excluding Japan). Since 1980 African per capita income has declined.

Poverty and economic stagnation or decline are predominant characteristics of Africa, but there are important variations in levels of income and growth performance. Table 3–28 distinguishes between the 14 countries where average income is above 2 000 international dollars a head and the 43 countries below this level. In the first group, 1998 per capita income averaged $2 816 and in the rest only $840. Countries in the first group now have an average income like that of Western Europe in 1900, in the rest it is below the Western European level in 1600. The first relatively prosperous group consists of five countries on the Mediterranean littoral (Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia). Of these Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia had reasonable growth performance in 1973–98, but 1998 per capita income in Algeria was 15 per cent below the 1985 peak, and in Libya about half of the 1973 level. The second group, at the Southern tip of the continent, consists of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Swaziland. Botswana has been one of the world’s fastest growing economies (5.4 per cent per capita from 1973 to 1998). Its growth performance was similar to that of Singapore, but was largely based on exploitation of its diamond resources. South Africa’s per capita income in 1998 was 14 per cent below its 1981 peak, and Namibia’s 9 per cent below 1981. The third group of five small countries consists of special cases. Gabon and the Congo have relatively high and expanding levels of petroleum production and export. The three others are islands in the Indian Ocean with population growth rates well below the African average. Reunion is a French overseas department with a high degree of subsidy from the metropole. In the Seychelles and Mauritius the majority of the population are of Indian origin, bilingual in English and French. Seychelles has a high tourist income. Mauritius has been successful in developing exports of manufactures. Threequarters of Africa’s population belongs to a fourth group where per capita income peaked in 1980. By 1998 it had fallen by a quarter. This group of countries is the hard core of African poverty. In explaining the reasons for African poverty, one must distinguish between longer term influences and the reasons for the reversal of economic advance over the past two decades. Table 3–27.

Until late in the nineteenth century, most of the continent was unknown and unexplored, occupied by hunter–gatherers, pastoralists or practitioners of subsistence agriculture. Levels of education and technology were primitive. Land was relatively abundant, was allocated by traditional chiefs, without Western–style property rights. The only territorial units which resembled those of today were Egypt, Ethiopia, Liberia, Morocco and South Africa. Slaves had been the main export. The European powers became interested in grabbing Africa in the 1880s. France and Britain were the most successful. Twenty–two countries eventually emerged from French colonisation, 21 from British, five from Portuguese, three from Belgian, two from Spanish. Germany lost its colonies after the First World War, Italy after the Second. The colonialists created boundaries to suit their own convenience, with little regard to local traditions or ethnicity. European law and property rights were introduced with little regard to traditional forms of land allocation. Hence the colonists got the best land and most of the benefits from exploitation of mineral rights and plantation agriculture. African incomes were kept low by forced labour or apartheid practices. Little was done to build a transport infrastructure or to cater for popular education. European colonisers withdrew from the mid 1950s onwards. The British colonial bond with Egypt and the Sudan was broken in 1956. Ghana became independent in 1957, Nigeria in 1960, Tanzania in 1961, Kenya in 1963. White settler interests retarded the process in Zimbabwe and Namibia. In South Africa, the black population did not get political rights until 1994. French decolonisation Table 3–28.

> Source: The estimates of GDP growth for African countries are of poorer quality than for other regions. National accounts were generally introduced by the colonial authorities in the late 1950s, and the quality and staffing of statistical offices since independence has been weak. There are also more serious problems in the estimates of comparative GDP levels than for other regions, see Table A4–g, and the accompanying commentary.

started with Morocco and Tunisia in 1956. Guinea broke away in 1958, the rest of the sub–Saharan colonies became independent in 1960, and Algeria in 1962. Belgium abandoned Zaire in 1960, Burundi and Rwanda in 1962. Portugal and Spain made their exit in 1975. In these years, the Cold War was at its height, and Africa became a focus of international rivalry. China, the USSR, Cuba and East European countries supplied economic and military aid to new countries viewed as proxies in a world wide conflict of interest. Western countries, Israel and Taiwan were more generous in supplying aid and less fastidious in its allocation than they might otherwise have been. As a result, Africa accumulated large external debts which had a meagre developmental pay–off. Independence brought many serious challenges. The political leadership had to try to create elements of national solidarity and stability more or less from scratch. The new national entities were in most cases a creation of colonial rule. There was great ethnic diversity with no tradition or indigenous institutions of nationhood. The linguistic vehicle of administration and education was generally French, English or Portuguese rather than the languages most used by the mass of the population. Thirteen of the new francophone countries had belonged to two large federations whose administrative and transport network had been centred in Dakar and Brazzaville. These networks had to be revamped. There was a great scarcity of people with education or administrative experience. Suddenly these countries had to create a political elite, staff a national bureaucracy, establish a judiciary, create a police force and armed forces, send out dozens of diplomats. The first big wave of job opportunities strengthened the role of patronage and rent–seeking, and reduced the attractions of entrepreneurship. The existing stock of graduates was too thin to meet the demands and there was heavy dependence on foreign personnel. The process of state creation involved armed struggle in many cases. In Algeria, Angola, Mozambique, Sudan, Zaire and Zimbabwe, the struggle for independence involved war with the colonial power or the white settler population. A few years later, Nigeria, Uganda and Ethiopia suffered from civil wars and bloody dictators. More recently Burundi, Eritrea, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Somalia have all had the same problem. These wars were a major impediment to development. Table 3–29.

Most of the recent attempts to explain Africa’s weak economic performance (Bloom and Sachs, 1998; Collier and Gunning, 1999; and Ndulu and O’Connell, 1999) give major emphasis to the problem of “governance”. Ndulu and O’Connell found that in 1988 only five countries “had multi–party systems allowing meaningful political competition at the national level.” They categorised 11 as military oligarchies, 16 as plebiscitary one–party states, 13 as competitive one–party, and two as settler oligarchies (Namibia and South Africa, where the situation has now changed). In most of the one–party states, the incumbent ruler sought to keep his position for life. In most states, rulers relied for support on a narrow group who shared the spoils of office. Corruption became widespread, property rights insecure, business decisions risky. Collier and Gunning (p. 93) suggest that nearly two fifths of African private wealth now consists of assets held abroad (compared with 10 per cent in Latin America and 6 per cent in East Asia). Such estimates are necessarily rough, but with Presidents like Mobutu in Zaire or Abacha in Nigeria, it is not difficult to believe that the proportion is high. A major factor in the slowdown since 1980 has been external debt. As the Cold War faded from the mid 1980s, foreign aid levelled off, and net lending to Africa fell. Although the flow of foreign direct investment has risen it has not offset the fall in other financial flows. Table 3–30 shows clearly that lending to Africa has expanded less since 1990 than the flow to Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and the former USSR. The aggregate external debt of African countries in 1998 was $427 per head of the population. In Asia it was $314, Latin America $1 548, and Eastern Europe and the successor states of the former USSR $932. Asian per capita income is more than twice as high as in Africa, Latin American more than four times as big and in the former communist group three times as big as in Africa. The African burden is clearly the heaviest, and African capacity to finance investment from domestic saving is lower than in other continents. Although some African countries are scheduled to benefit from debt relief under the 1996 and 1999 HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries) Initiatives of the World Bank and IMF, and more have benefited from Paris Club debt relief, the scope of these debt restructuring operations has been much smaller in Africa than in Latin America (see Table 3–31). African access to IMF financing has also been much more restricted than that of countries in Asia and the former USSR in their recent debt crises. Although the setback to African growth in the past two decades has been smaller in quantitative terms than that in the former USSR, the outlook for the future is more depressing. Levels of education and health are much worse, population growth is still explosive, problems of political stability and armed conflict are bigger, and problems of institutional adjustment and integration in a liberal capitalist world order seem just as great. Most of these problems require changes within Africa, but their course could obviously be influenced by outside help in reducing the debt burden.

# Growth and Levels of World Population, GDP and GDP Per Capita, Benchmark Years, 1820–1998 

This Appendix provides a quantitative picture of the world economy for the period 1820–1998. It presents estimates of population, GDP and GDP per capita for seven benchmark years and their rates of growth in five phases of development 1820–70, 1870–1913, 1913–1950, 1950–73, and 1973–98. The first section covers Europe and Western Offshoots (the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand); the second, Latin America; the third, Asia; and the fourth, Africa. The source notes explain the derivation of the estimates. Table A–a shows the coverage of our GDP sample. It represents 81 per cent of the world economy for 1820, 93 per cent in 1913, and over 99 per cent for 1950–98. As the objective is comprehensive coverage, proxy measures were needed to fill holes in the data set. The proxy procedures are explained in the text, and generally assume parallelism of per capita growth experience in the missing countries with that in other countries in the same region. In order to add the individual country GDP estimates to obtain regional or world totals it is necessary to convert them into a common currency. Exchange rate conversion does not provide a satisfactory measure of real values. Purchasing power parity converters (PPPs) are preferable. These have been developed for use by international organisations over the past 50 years, and the best available are those from the International Comparison Programme (ICP) of the United Nations, Eurostat and OECD, though the coverage of these is not yet universal. Table A–b shows the nature of the converters used here. ICP measures were used for 70 countries representing 93.9 per cent of world GDP in the benchmark year 1990. Estimates from the Penn World Tables, version 5.6 (Summers and Heston, 1995) were used for 83 countries, representing 5.5 per cent of the world economy. Proxy measures were used for 45 (most very small) countries for which no ICP or PWT estimates were available. These represented 0.6 per cent of world GDP. 1990 benchmark levels were merged with the GDP time series in constant national prices, thus providing level comparisons for every year in terms of the benchmark 

numeraire . Table A–b also shows the nature of the converters used in Maddison (1995 a). Population figures do not pose the index number and aggregation problems which arise for GDP, and there are fewer holes in the data set. Figures for 1950 onwards were based on official sources, and where these seemed deficient, from the International Programs Center of the US Bureau of the Census. For years before 1950, estimates are based on census material and the work of historical demographers. Pre–1950 estimates are weakest for Africa, considerably better for Asia and Latin America, and best for Europe and Western Offshoots. The present estimates are an update and revision of those in Maddison (1995 a). That study concentrated on a sample of 56 countries, for which full source notes were given. Figures for other countries were given in summary form, with no detailed source notes (see Appendix F of Maddison, 1995 a). Here the source notes cover many more countries, for which greater statistical detail is presented. The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 170 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

The revisions and expanded coverage are most significant for Asia; where source notes now cover 37 countries compared with 11 in Maddison (1995 a). Estimates are also provided for the 22 new East European countries which emerged from the disintegration of the former USSR, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia in the 1990s (see also Appendix D). Estimates for Germany are revised to take account of the integration of new Länder in the East. For Western Europe, Latin America and Africa, revisions in GDP indices are relatively modest, so for these regions it was not felt necessary to reproduce source notes from Maddison (1995 a) in extenso ,though a full description is given of the derivation of the benchmark levels of GDP in “international” Geary–Khamis dollars for 1990. There are significant revisions in population for Africa and Latin America. Table A–c provides a confrontation of the previous estimates of world and regional population and GDP, with those in the present study. 

U PDATING THE E STIMATES GDP 

The following international sources are useful for those who wish to update the GDP estimates. For 21 European countries and the 4 Western Offshoots, OECD , National Accounts of OECD Countries , Vol. 1, presents the latest available national accounts in current and constant prices in standardised form, and has hitherto given retrospective coverage back to 1960. Because of the significant changes involved in the switchover to the new 1993 SNA system, the latest retrospective view goes back only to 1988 at best. OECD, Economic Outlook provides twice yearly provisional estimates of GDP volume change in the current and forthcoming year. These publications also cover Japan, Korea, Mexico and Turkey. For 11 East European countries and the 15 successor states of the former Soviet Union estimates of GDP are available in constant prices for 1990 onwards (and for material product back to 1980) from the Statistics Division of ECE (Economic Commission for Europe of the United Nations). The Interstate Statistical Committee of CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) has published detailed national accounts for 12 successor republics of the former USSR, Osnovie Makroekonomikie Pokazateli Stran Sodruschestva Nezavisimich Gosudarstv 1991–1998 , Moscow, 1999. For 32 Latin American countries, ECLAC (Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean) publishes estimates of annual volume changes in GDP for the current year and the preceding nine years in its annual end December, Preliminary Overview of the Economies of Latin America and the Caribbean. 

For 38 East Asian countries, ADB (Asian Development Bank) publishes Key Indicators of Developing Asian and Pacific Countries annually. This contains national accounts in some detail in current and constant prices, with an 18 year retrospective coverage. For 11 West Asian countries and Egypt, ESCWA (Economic and Social Commission for West Asia )

publishes National Accounts Studies of the ESCWA Region annually. It contains national accounts in current prices and summary annual estimates of GDP volume movement for the previous decade and provisional estimates for the current year. For 51 African countries, the IMF (International Monetary Fund) twice yearly World Economic Outlook shows annual changes in GDP volume for the past decade. It provides similar indicators for the rest of the world. The IMF database is available back to 1970 on internet: http://www.imf.org/ external/pubs/ft/weo/2000/01/data/index.htm. Appendix A 171 

There are two very useful sources of information which have now been discontinued but are still very useful for years before 1990. The OECD Development Centre set up the first international database. It published National Accounts of Less Developed Countries, 1950–1966 in 1968 and issued 23 annual updates ( Latest Information on National Accounts of Developing Countries ) from 1969 to 1991. The World Bank’s World Tables were first published in 1976 (with second and third editions in 1980 and 1983) and annually from 1987 to 1995. 

Population 

The International Programs Center of the US Bureau of the Census provides annual estimates from 1950 onwards, and annual projections to 2050 for all countries. The estimates are revised regularly, and retrospective estimates back to 1950 are included for the new countries which emerged in the 1990s. The estimates are available on internet: http://www.census.gov./ipc. I used their estimates for 1950 onwards for 178 countries (25 European, the United States, 44 Latin American, 51 Asian and 57 African). 

Levels of GDP in International Dollars 

In this study the benchmark GDP estimates are in 1990 international dollars. I explained the reasons for preferring PPP (purchasing power parity) converters rather than exchange rates, and the advantages of Geary–Khamis multilateral PPPs in Maddison (1995 a) pp. 164–79. Such measures are available from the International Comparison Programme (ICP) of the United Nations, Eurostat and OECD. The ICP exercise was initiated by Irving Kravis, Alan Heston and Robert Summers of the University of Pennsylvania, as a follow up and greatly expanded version of work undertaken in OEEC in the 1950s. Their magnum opus was Kravis, Heston and Summers, World Product and Income: International Comparisons of Real Gross Product (1982). Their approach was a highly sophisticated comparative pricing exercise in which national accounts expenditure in the participating countries in a given year was decomposed in great detail for representative items of consumption, investment and government services. The results were multilateralised using the Geary–Khamis technique which ensured transitivity, base country invariance and additivity. Their 1982 study covered 34 countries. The Pennsylvania team also created the Penn World Tables which updated and reconciled the material from all the preceding ICP rounds, and added short–cut estimates (using more limited price information) for many countries not covered by ICP. This important supplement to ICP was issued in several successively more ambitious versions from 1978 to 1995. The ICP was taken over as a co–operative venture by UNSO (United Nations Statistical Office), Eurostat (Statistical Office of the European Union) and OECD in the 1980s. There was a division of labour in which the different agencies made estimates for their respective regions, and the results were adjusted for comparability and consolidated by the UN Statistical Office. UNSO produced such consolidated estimates for 60 countries for 1980 and 57 for 1985. Thereafter the arrangement for consolidating the results on a world–wide basis broke down but the regional exercises continued. For 1990 there were only two regional exercises; OECD estimates on a Geary–Khamis basis for the 22 countries shown in Table A1–g (as well as for Japan and Turkey) and an ECE study for five East European countries and the USSR (shown in Table A1–h). At the time I wrote Maddison (1995 a) there had been several ICP rounds for 87 countries for at least one year. I used the 1990 OECD and ECE estimates for 26 countries, and updated the available results of earlier ICP rounds to 1990 for 14 other countries (seven in Latin America, seven in Asia), and ICP equivalent estimates for East Germany, Bangladesh and Pakistan. Thus I used ICP or ICP equivalent estimates for 43 countries representing 79.7 per cent of world GDP. I used the Penn World Tables of The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 172 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

Robert Summers and Alan Heston (version 5.5 issued in 1993) for 106 countries, and their estimate for China. In total the Summers and Heston component represented 19.5 per cent of world GDP in 1990. For the remaining countries, representing 0.8 per cent of world GDP, I used proxy estimates (see Appendix F of Maddison, 1995 a). In the present study, I have continued to use 1990 as the benchmark year for several reasons: it is useful to retain the 1990 benchmark to ensure greater transparency in understanding the nature of the revisions and updating of Maddison (1995 a); Maddison (1998 a) made a very detailed reconstruction of Chinese GDP on the standardised SNA basis used in Western countries, with an estimate for 1990 in Geary–Khamis dollars; it would be a very complex exercise to switch from a 1990 to a 1993 benchmark on a consistent basis for different parts of the world, and the quality of the result would most likely be inferior to that for 1990. For 1993 there are regional ICP estimates for 68 countries: OECD results for 24 countries, ESCAP for 14 East Asian countries, ESCWA for eight West Asian countries, and Eurostat for 22 African countries. All of these are available on a Geary–Khamis basis (as well as the EKS basis preferred for political reasons by Eurostat because it gives all countries the same weight). There are considerable problems in putting this material together on a comparable basis. The ESCAP estimates use the Hong Kong rather than the US dollar as a numeraire . ESCWA uses a short–cut, reduced information approach. The Eurostat results for Africa are intra–African relatives linked to the US dollar via a standardised exchange rate rather than a purchasing power parity with the United States as the numeraire country. To be useable for our purposes they need to be adjusted in the same way as the UN Statistical Office did for earlier Eurostat exercises for Africa (see note to Table A4–g). OECD has recently published ICP8 estimates for 1996 for a total of 48 countries in two volumes: 

Purchasing Power Parities and Real Expenditure , 1999 covers the 28 OECD member countries and four others (Israel, Slovakia, Slovenia and the Russian Federation); and A PPP Comparison for the NIS ,2000. This covers the 15 successor states of the former USSR, Turkey and Mongolia. The ECE has made estimates which include five other East European countries for 1996 (Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia and Romania). The results of these three studies were multilateralised using the EKS procedure. Estimates on a Geary–Khamis basis have not yet been released. No 1996 estimates are available for other parts of the world. Appendix D assesses the results of these studies for Eastern Europe and the former USSR and describes the problems of reconciling them with those used in the present study. In the present estimates for the 1990 benchmark, I have used the same ICP sources I used in Maddison (1995 a), backcast ESCAP and ESCWA results in their 1993 exercise for eight Asian countries to 1990, the OECD 1993 exercise for Turkey and the OECD 1996 results for Mongolia. I dropped the Eurostat estimates for Africa in favour of Penn World Tables (version 5.6). Appendix A 173

Source: "Sample" countries are those for which quantitative estimates of the volume movement of GDP are available. Proxy estimates are needed for missing countries in order to derive the regional and world totals (see the detailed explanation of the gap–filling procedure for 1820–1913 for Asian countries in section A–3 of the source notes). Generally proxies were derived by assuming that per capita GDP movement in the country and for period concerned moved parallel with that of other countries within the same region. The proxy GDP can then be derived by multiplying the per capita GDP by population (for which the coverage of the estimates is much more complete). Coverage is much higher for the period since 1950 as national accounts have been produced by official statisticians. For 1913 and earlier, the sample country estimates were mainly by quantitative economic historians. There were major political changes in the 1990s which increased the number of countries from 199 in Maddison (1995 a) to 217. The former USSR has split into 15 countries, Yugoslavia into 5, Czechoslovakia into 2, and Eritrea has split from Ethiopia. The 2 Germanies have been reunited, and I have treated the West Bank and Gaza as if they were a consolidated unit. In most cases it is not possible to carry back the estimates for these new countries before 1990. However, the present estimates for new countries (e.g. the 15 successor countries of the former USSR) are (when consolidated) consistent with the historical estimates for the political entity to which they previously belonged.

Note: In Maddison (1995 a), I used the different ICP rounds then available, with adjustment where necessary to 1990, for the 43 of the 56 sample countries. For the non–sample countries, and for the African sample countries (where I had doubts about the quality of the ICP estimates), I used Penn World Tables. In the present study, see Table AI–b above, I used the new estimates for China from Maddison (1998 a) and made maximal use of the ICP results available from the 1975, 1980, 1985, and 1990 rounds, and partial use of the PPPs from the 1993 and 1996 rounds. In doing this I adjusted for revisions in nominal GDP in national prices. I did not use the ICP results for African countries (see Table A4–g). In Maddison (1995 a) I used the Penn World Tables 5.5 version (1993), whereas the present study uses the PWT 5.6 version (1995) which is the latest available.

# Population, GDP and GDP Per Capita in Western Europe, Western Offshoots, Eastern Europe and the Successor States of the Former USSR 12 West European Countries 

The quantitative historical evidence for these countries is better than for most other parts of the world. It is set out in detail in Maddison (1995 a). GDP and population for Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland for 1820–1960 and Italy 1820–1970 are from Maddison (1995 a), updated (except as noted below for France and Norway) from OECD, National Accounts 1960–1997 , Vol. 1, Paris 1999 to 1990 and for 1990 onwards from OECD, National Accounts of OECD Countries, 1988–1998 , vol. 1, 2000. Figures are adjusted to exclude the impact of territorial change and refer to 1998 frontiers, except for Germany and the United Kingdom. 

Germany: Figures for 1950 onwards refer to 1991 frontiers, 1820–1913 to Germany within its 1913 boundaries (excluding Alsace–Lorraine). See Table A–d for details. 

Netherlands: 1820–1913 GDP movement derived from Smits, Horlings and van Zanden (2000). 1913–60 GDP movement and 1820–1960 population from Maddison (1995 a) updated from OECD sources. 

Switzerland: It was assumed that the 1820–70 GDP per capita movement paralleled that in Germany. 

United Kingdom: 1820–1913 estimates include the whole of Ireland, see Maddison (1995 a), p. 232, and Table B–13, those for 1950 onwards include Northern Ireland. 1960 onwards updated from OECD sources. The latest OECD national accounts publication incorporates new estimates for 15 countries revised to conform with the SNA 1993 standardised system. This involves two significant modifications in statistical practice: 

a) treatment of computer software as investment rather than an intermediate product, which along with other changes has raised the 1990 benchmark GDP level as shown in Table A1–g; 

b) a recommendation that countries adopt chain–weighted indices to measure the movement in GDP volume. Such indices are now used by France, Greece, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway and Sweden. For most countries, the new estimates are available only for very recent years, which is one of the reasons why the new OECD yearbook no longer has the historical depth it has had for the past 30 years. GDP indices based on chain weights for France and Norway for 1978– 98 were made available by OECD and used here, together with 1960–78 estimates for these countries from the 1999 OECD national accounts publication. The chain weights seem to make no difference to Norwegian growth, but made French growth slightly faster. The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 178 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006

1950–59 GDP movement from “GDP and Other Major NIPA Series, 1929–97”, Survey of Current Business, August 1998. This series is based on a chained index as described in J.S. Landefeld and R.P. Parker, “BEA’s Chain Indexes, Time Series and Measures of Long Term Growth”, Survey of Current Business, May 1997, p. 66, Table 5. 1959–98 GDP movement and 1990 benchmark level from the new estimates of BEA in Survey of Current Business, December 1999. The 1959–98 figures implement the recommendation of the new standardised System of National Accounts 1993 (published jointly by Eurostat, IMF, OECD, UN and World Bank) to include computer software as investment rather than intermediate input. The impact of the revisions, which raise the growth rate and the 1990 benchmark GDP level is described in E.P. Seskin, “Improved Estimates of the National Income and Product Accounts for 1959–98: Results of the Comprehensive Revision”, Survey of Current Business , December 1999. 

Australia, New Zealand and Canada: Population 1820–1973 from Maddison (1995 a) updated from OECD sources. 1820 and 1870 amended to include indigenous population. Indigenous populations were as follows: Australia 300 000 in 1820, 150 000 in 1870; Canada 75 000 in 1820 and 45 000 in 1870, New Zealand 100 000 in 1820 and 50 000 in 1870 (see Maddison, 1995 a, pp. 96–7). 1820–1960 GDP movement from Maddison (1995 a) amended for 1820–70 to include income of the indigenous population (taken to be $400 per capita in 1820 and 1870). Canadian and New Zealand GDP movement 1960–98 from OECD sources. New Zealand estimates for 1969–87 refer to fiscal years. Australian GDP movement 1960–98 for calendar years based on the new official chain index (supplied by OECD) which shows slightly faster growth than the old index (annual compound growth of 3.95 per cent a year compared with 3.87 per cent for 1960–90). The Australian and Canadian GDP measures conform to the 1993 system of accounts, which New Zealand has not yet adopted. 

Eastern Europe (7/12 Countries) 

There have been major changes in the past decade in political and statistical systems which means that the estimates for these countries are of lower quality than for Western Europe. Population of Albania 1820–1913, Bulgaria 1820, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia 1820–70 from McEvedy and Jones (1978), otherwise 1820–1949 from Maddison (1995 a), p. 110. 1950 onwards from International Programs Center, US Bureau of the Census. East European GDP to 1990 from Maddison (1995 a), Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland updated from OECD sources, other countries from the database of the Statistics Division of ECE (Economic Commission for Europe of the UN). 1820 estimates of GDP were available for only one country (Czechoslovakia); for 1870 for two countries (Czechoslovakia and Hungary); for 1913 for four countries (Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia). In order to get a rough GDP estimate for the seven countries as a whole for 1820–1913, per capita GDP movement in the missing countries was assumed to move parallel to the average for the countries which were represented. In the 1990s, Czechoslovakia split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and Yugoslavia broke up into five republics; 1990–98 GDP volume movement in the five successor republics of Yugoslavia from ECE Statistics Division, 1990 breakdown of GDP by constituent republics derived from the Yugoslav Statistical Yearbook for 1990 (see Table A–f).

Former USSR 

Population 1913–90 from Maddison (1995 a), with revised estimates for 1820 and 1870 for the Asian population in the area of the former USSR (see Appendix B). 1950 population in each of the 15 successor republics from Naselenie SSSR 1987 , Finansi i Statistika, Moscow, 1988, pp. 8–15 adjusted to mid–year; 1973 from Narodnoe Khoziastvo SSSR , 1972 and 1973 editions, p. 9, adjusted to mid– year; 1990 from Mir v Tsifrakh 1992, Goskomstat CIS, Moscow 1992; movement from 1990 onwards from ECE Statistics Division. GDP 1870–1990 for the USSR within its 1990 boundaries from Maddison (1995 a). Maddison (1998 b) provides a detailed analysis of techniques for adjusting the national accounts of the Soviet era from an MPS to an SNA basis. 1820–70 per capita GDP assumed to move in the same proportion as the aggregate for Eastern Europe. Breakdown of 1991 GDP level by successor republics derived from B.M. Bolotin “The Former Soviet Union as Reflected in National Accounts Statistics”, in S. Hirsch, ed., Memo 3: In Search of Answers in the Post–Soviet Era, Bureau of National Affairs, Washington DC, 1992, cited in Maddison (1995 a), p. 142, backcast to 1990 and adjusted to the USSR GDP total for that year. 1990–98 movement in GDP volume by republic from ECE Statistics Division.

A rough measure of the 1973–90 GDP volume movement in each of the 15 successor states was derived from official Soviet indices of real “national income” (MPS concept) which are available for 1958–90, see Narodnoe Khoziastvo SSSR , 1990 ed., p. 13; 1987 ed., p. 123; 1974 ed., p. 574; and 1965 ed., p. 590. Rates of growth of real “national income” 1973–90 were adjusted to a GDP basis, using the ratio which prevailed for the USSR as a whole for this period (.49075). See Maddison (1998 b), p. 313 for a comparison of these two types of measure for 1913–90. The official National Accounts of the Russian Federation ( Natsionalnie Schchota Rossii, 1999 )provide a breakdown of Russian GDP and GDP per capita for nine regions, and 90 administrative districts. The five Siberian regions and the Far East region together accounted for 29 per cent of product geographically allocable for 1997, and the Caucasus region 5.8 per cent. Thus, a little more than a third of GDP in the Russian Federation was generated in Asia, or about 232 billion international dollars of the Russian Federation’s total GDP of $697 billion in 1997. Eight of the other successor republics of the USSR were in Asia (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan). Their total 1997 GDP was 216 billion international dollars. Thus the Asian part of the Russian republic, and the eight other successor republics in Asia together accounted for 448 billion international dollars or about 39 per cent of the total for the former USSR. The per capita product of the different parts of the Russian Federation is also shown in the 1999 yearbook. In the city of Moscow, per capita income was 2.3 times the national average, in St. Petersburg about the same as the national average. Income levels in Siberia and the Far East were generally well above the national average. The lowest incomes were in the Caucasus region, less than a fifth of the national average in Ingushetia, 28 per cent in Dagestan, not available for Chechnya. In the present exercise, the 1990 level of GDP in international dollars was derived from the ICP exercise for 1990 as shown in Table A–1h below. The breakdown by successor republic was based on the Bolotin estimates as indicated above. Recently the OECD, ECE, and the governments of most of the successor republics have collaborated on a new PPP exercise for 1996. This exercise was done using the EKS rather than the Geary–Khamis method. The results show significant differences from the ICP 6 estimates which I have used (see Appendix D). Appendix A 183

a) East German GDP in international dollars was 82 177 million in 1990. 

Source: GDP in national currency from OECD National Accounts of OECD Countries, 1988–1998, vol. 1, OECD, Paris, 2000, except for the Netherlands which is from OECD Quarterly National Accounts (1999:4), and the United States which is from Survey of Current Business , December 1999, p. 132. Official Italian GDP estimates reduced by 3 per cent as explained in Maddison (1995 a), p. 133. Geary–Khamis purchasing power converters from the sixth round of the International Comparison Project (ICP) for 1990 — see Maddison (1995 a) Table C–6, p. 172; exchange rates from the same source. PPPs and exchange rates are expressed in units of national currency by PPP per US dollar. GDP in million international dollars converted by PPP is derived by dividing column 1 by column 2. GDP in million US dollars converted at exchange rates is derived by dividing column 1 by column 3. When one makes binary comparisons of purchasing power, e.g. of France and the United States, there are three possible approaches. One can a) revalue French expenditure at US prices and get a "Laspeyres" comparison of GDP volume; b) revalue US expenditure at French prices and get a "Paasche" volume comparison; (c) make a compromise "Fisher" geometric average of the Laspeyres and Paasche measures. The results of such binary studies can be used to compare the situation in a number of countries, e.g. France/United States, Germany/United States and United Kingdom/United States comparisons can be linked using the United States as a "star" country. However, the derivative France– Germany, United Kingdom–Germany and France–United Kingdom results are inferential and will not necessarily be the same as one could derive from direct binary comparisons of each pair. Such comparisons are not "transitive", but transitivity and additivity can be achieved by use of a "multilateral" PPP. The Geary–Khamis measure is the multilateral measure I prefer as it gives weights to countries corresponding to the size of their GDP (see Maddison, 1995 a, p. 163, for a detailed explanation). For most countries, the new GDP figures in national currencies are higher than those used in Maddison (1995 a). They incorporate routine revisions and those resulting from adoption of the 1993 SNA (standardised system of national accounts). This was adopted by Norway in 1995, Denmark and Canada in 1997. Australia, Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom made the change later, and figures on the new basis were published for these 15 countries for the first time by OECD in the 1988–98 yearbook. The new system involves treatment of expenditure on mineral exploration and computer software as investment rather than intermediate input. In some countries, e.g. France and Italy "entertainment, literary and artistic originals" are also now treated as investment. Iceland, New Zealand and Switzerland still use the old 1968 SNA and have not made these methodological changes. As a result of these revisions the 1990 GDP levels have changed by the following ratios to the level shown in Maddison (1995 a): Austria 1.00676 United Kingdom 1.00928 Belgium 1.02342 Luxembourg 1.15206 Denmark 1.02779 Iceland 1.03700 Finland 1.01591 Greece 0.99539 France 1.01774 Ireland 1.06406 Germany 1.00033 Portugal 1.014765 Italy 1.00668 Spain 1.00051 Netherlands 1.04184 Australia 1.04055 Norway 1.09314 New Zealand 0.99290 Sweden 1.00000 Canada 1.00567 Switzerland 1.01041 United States 1.06192

Source: GDP in national currency from International Comparison of Gross Domestic Product in Europe 1990, United Nations Statistical Commission and ECE, Geneva and New York, 1994, p. 61. These comparisons were carried out in cooperation with the national statistical offices, with adjustments to make the coverage of the national accounts conform to the standardised national accounting system used in Western countries. Adjustments were also made to correct for lower quality of goods in the East European countries. The results were multilateralised using the EKS rather than the Geary–Khamis technique, and the PPP adjusted GDPs were expressed in Austrian schillings. The relative volume indices of GDP were converted to an approximate Geary–Khamis basis using Austrian GDP in international dollars in Table 2.4 as a bridge, see op. cit., p. 5. This is how the column 4 results were estimated and the implicit PPP in column 3 was derived by dividing column 1 by column 4. Exchange rates were derived from IMF, International Financial Statistics, 

except for the USSR which is from World Bank, World Tables 1995 . Since 1990, these six countries have become 25. Czechoslovakia has split into two countries, Yugoslavia into five, and the USSR into 15. In order to get rough provisional estimates for GDP in these 22 new successor states, I assumed that their proportional share in 1990 GDP was the same as it was in national currency. The OECD has released new estimates in international dollars for 20 of these new states (excluding Bosnia and Serbia), using the EKS technique of multilateralisation, see A PPP Comparison for the NIS, 1994, 1995 and 1996, OECD, February 2000. See Appendix D for a confrontation of these new estimates with those I use here.

# Population, GDP and GDP Per Capita in 44 Latin American and Caribbean Countries 

There are eight core countries for which GDP estimates are available before 1950. 1820–1990 GDP movement for Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela from Maddison (1995 a), updated from ECLAC, Economic Survey of Latin America and the Caribbean: Summary 1998–99 , 1999, p. 32. Brazilian GDP 1950–98 as above, 1820–1900 from Maddison (1995 a); per capita GDP movement 1900–50 from Maddison and Associates (1992), p. 212. Mexican GDP movement 1870–1910 from Coatsworth (1989), 1910–60 from Maddison (1995 a), 1960 onwards from OECD sources. I assumed a smaller drop in Mexican GDP per capita 1820–70 than Coatsworth. GDP 1820–1936 for Uruguay from Luis Bertola and Associates, PBI de Uruguay 1870–1936 , Montevideo, 1998. 1936–90 GDP supplied by Luis Bertola, 1990 onwards from ECLAC (1999). Benchmark 1990 level of GDP in the eight countries in international dollars from Table A2–g. Population 1820–1950 from Maddison (1995 a) except Uruguay (supplied by Luis Bertola). 1950 onwards from US Bureau of the Census. There are 15 other countries for which detailed estimates of population and GDP are shown. For 13 of them, 1870–1913 population was derived by interpolating the estimates of N. Sanchez Albornoz, “The Population of Latin America, 1850–1930”, in L. Bethell, ed., The Cambridge History of Latin America, vol. 4, Cambridge University Press, 1986, p. 122. Jamaica 1870 and 1913 derived from G. Eisner, Jamaica, 1830–1930: A Study in Economic Growth, Manchester University Press, 1961, p. 134. 1870–1950 movement in Trinidad and Tobago was assumed to be proportionately the same as in Jamaica. 1820–70 population in the 15 countries assumed to move in the same proportion as the aggregate for the eight core countries. 1950–98 population movement from US Bureau of the Census. 1950–73 GDP movement for 11 of the 15 countries from ECLAC, Series Historicas del Crecimiento de America Latina, Santiago, 1978, 1973–90 from World Bank, World Tables (1995), and 1990 onwards from ECLAC (1999). Cuba 1950–90 from various ECLAC sources, 1990 onwards from ECLAC, Preliminary Overview of the Economies of Latin America, Santiago (1998 and 1999 editions). GDP of Puerto Rico 1950–98 from PBI Historico, Junta de Planificación, San José, 1998. Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago 1950–73 from OECD Development Centre database, 1973–90 from World Bank, World Tables , 1990 onwards from ECLAC (1999). 1820–1950 movement in aggregate per capita GDP of the 15 countries assumed to move in the same proportion as the aggregate for the eight core countries. Aggregate estimates for 21 small Caribbean countries are shown in Tables A–2a to A–2f; country detail for 1950–98 in Table A–g. Table A2–g shows the derivation of 1990 benchmark GDP levels from ICP studies in 1990 international prices for the eight core countries and ten others. Penn World Tables were used for Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, St. Kitts Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago.

For 11 small Caribbean countries and Cuba, neither ICP nor PWT estimates of PPP were available. It was assumed that the average per capita GDP level for these countries was the same as the average for the 32 countries for which indicators were available, and for Cuba that it was about 15 per cent below the Latin America average. ICP estimates represented nearly 95.2 per cent of the aggregate GDP for Latin America in 1990, PWT nearly 3.2 per cent, and proxy valuations 1.7 per cent. It was assumed that the aggregate proportionate GDP per capita movement for the three missing countries for 1870–1913 was the same as the average for the other five core countries. For 1820 it was assumed that the average level of per capita GDP for the missing core countries was the same as the average for Brazil and Mexico. For the 36 other countries no estimates of GDP movement were available for 1820–1950. Their average per capita GDP movement was assumed to be proportionate to that in the eight sample countries (including the proxy element in the latter). Thus the total proxy component of Latin American aggregate GDP in 1820 was 44.0 per cent, for 1870 38.2 per cent, for 1913 16.7 per cent, and negligible for 1950 onwards. Table A–g.

Source: Column 1 shows GDP in the reference year in national currency units, in most cases as specified in the original ICP estimate. For Argentina, Peru and Venezuela, there were upward adjustments to the official estimates of nominal GDP in 1980, after the ICP exercise was conducted. These involved upward adjustments of 36 per cent, 6.5 per cent, and 17.2 per cent respectively to correct for previous underestimates for informal activity. In the case of Mexico my estimate is 12.2 per cent lower than the official 1975 figure shown in OECD, National Accounts, 1960–97 ; the adjustment was made to correct for official exaggeration of output levels in agriculture, manufacturing and some services. The rationale for this change is explained in Maddison (1995 a), p. 166. The PPPs in column 2 are from ICP. Column 3 is derived from columns 1 and 2. Column 4 was derived by adjusting column 3 for the volume movement in GDP between the reference year and 1990. Column 5 is column 4 adjusted for the movement in the US GDP deflator from the reference year to 1990.

# Population, GDP and GDP Per Capita in 56 Asian Countries, 1820–1998 

The estimates for Asia are an update and substantial revision of those in Maddison (1995 a). The biggest revisions to GDP growth are those for China which are described in Maddison (1998 a), but there are improvements in those for India, Japan, the Philippines, Taiwan and a number of other countries. Source notes have been added for 26 countries, bringing the detailed coverage from 11 to 37 countries. There are also revisions to the population figures. The 1990 benchmark GDP estimates have been revised: for 24 countries representing 93 per cent of Asian GDP, they are based on ICP or ICP equivalent measures, for 16 countries (6 per cent of Asian GDP) they are derived from Penn World Tables version 5.6, and, for the remaining 1 per cent, GDP levels were measured by proxy estimates (16 countries). There are three groups of countries. The most reliable estimates of GDP growth are for the first group of 16 East Asian countries for which there has been substantial research on historical national accounts. These countries represented 95 per cent of Asian GDP in 1820, 85 per cent in 1950 and 88.4 per cent in 1998. The proxy estimates used to fill holes in the GDP dataset are shown in Table A–m. For the second group of 25 East Asian countries, the presently available GDP growth indicators have serious deficiencies and the quality of the 1990 benchmark estimates is poor. Detailed notes are given for Afghanistan, Cambodia, Laos, Mongolia, North Korea and Vietnam which all pose major problems. Conversion of their accounts from Soviet style material product to a GDP basis is one of these, and can only be done in rough fashion. The other countries in this group are Bhutan, Brunei, Macao, the Maldives and 15 Pacific islands. The 25 country group accounted for 3.7 per cent of Asian GDP in 1950 and 1.7 per cent in 1998. The third group consists of 15 West Asian countries, many of which were provinces of the Ottoman Empire until the end of the first world war. For most of these there has been no quantitative research on their macroeconomic performance before 1950. In ten countries, the postwar economy was strongly affected by the oil industry. Per capita income of the oil producers in 1950 was much higher than in prewar years, and a good deal higher than in the rest of Asia. Oil production in the area was 16 million metric tons in 1937, 86 million in 1950, and 1 053 million in 1973 — an increase of 11.5 per cent a year from 1950 to 1973. OPEC action in raising prices and restricting supply meant that production in 1998 was about the same as in 1973 (see Table 3–21). Growth was also significantly affected by war in Iran, Iraq, Israel, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen. This group represented 11.2 per cent of Asian GDP in 1950, 14.4 per cent in 1973, and 9.9 per cent in 1998. Our estimates for Asia exclude the eight Asian successor republics of the USSR (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan) and the Asian territory of the Russian Federation (see note on former USSR in Section A–1 of this Appendix, and Appendix D.).

Bangladesh: Maddison (1995 a) provides separate GDP and population estimates back to 1820 for Bangladesh and Pakistan. In this study the figures for India 1820–1913 include Bangladesh and Pakistan. 1950–66, volume movement of Bangladesh GDP from A. Maddison, Class Structure and Economic Growth, Allen and Unwin, London 1971, p. 171. 1966–78 GDP movement from World Bank, World Tables, various issues, 1978 onwards from ADB. Figures for 1967 onwards are for fiscal years. Population 1950 onwards from the Center for International Research, US Bureau of the Census. For India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, it is necessary to have benchmark GDP levels which are compatible with the fact that the three countries were united until 1947. The ICP estimates for Bangladesh and Pakistan (see Table A–3g) are not compatible with those for India. I therefore assumed that Pakistan and Bangladesh combined had the same average per capita GDP (in 1990 international dollars) as India in 1950. In 1950 Bangladesh and Pakistan were two “wings” of the former Pakistan. Their relative levels of GDP in 1950 were taken from Planning Commission, Reports of the Advisory Panels for the 

Fourth Five–Year Plan, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad, July 1970, p. 136.

Japan: Population 1820–1960 from Maddison (1995 a), updated from OECD sources. 1890–1940 GDP at 1934–36 market prices, by industry of origin, from K. Ohkawa and M. Shinohara, eds ., Patterns of Japanese Development: A Quantitative Appraisal, Yale, 1979, pp. 278–80. This is a summary of the results of K. Ohkawa, M. Shinohara, and M. Umemura, eds., Estimates of Long–Term Economic Statistics of Japan since 1868 , (LTES), which appeared in 14 volumes published between 1966 and 1988. Ohkawa and Shinohara (1979) reproduce the GDP by industry of origin estimates in LTES vol. 1 (1974) p. 227 with some tiny modifications. The LTES volumes were originally intended to cover the whole of the Meiji period back to 1868 but GDP aggregates were only published back to 1885, even though some of the volumes contained estimates for earlier years. The main reason for this reticence by Ohkawa and Shinohara was that the estimates in Vol. 9 on Agriculture and Forestry , published in 1966 had been criticised by James Nakamura, Agricultural Production and the Economic Development of Japan, 1873– 1922 , Princeton, 1966, for exaggerating the growth of rice production in the early years of the Meiji period. There were also some holes in the data base which reinforced their reluctance to estimate aggregate GDP for years before 1885. In 1979 new estimates of rice production became available for 1874–89 (see Saburo Yamada and Yujiro Hayami, “Agricultural Growth in Japan, 1880–1970”, in Y. Hayami, V.W. Ruttan and H.M. Southworth, eds., Agricultural Growth in Japan, Taiwan, Korea and the Philippines, Asian Productivity Center, Honolulu, 1979, p. 233). This source was used to revise the LTES GDP estimate for the farm sector, with rough estimates to fill the holes in the data set, GDP for 1874–89 was estimated using the same 1934–36 price weights as in the LTES (see Table A–i). GDP growth 1820–74 from Appendix B.

Mizoguchi, Reforms of Statistical System under Socio–Economic Changes, Maruzen, Tokyo, 1995, p. 225.

Total farm inputs from vol. 9, p. 186, value added in forestry from p. 234. Value added in fishery from vol. 1, p. 228, linked to estimates for earlier years in Ohkawa (1957), p. 72. Col. 2 (MM) refers to gross value added in manufacturing and mining. 1885–90 from Vol. 1, p. 227; 1874–85 derived from Shinohara's estimates in vol. 10, p. 145 and 243 for gross output and assuming that the 1885 ratio of value added to gross output (30 per cent) was also valid for 1874–84. Col. 3 (Const.) refers to construction; 1885–90 from vol. 1, p. 227, 1874–85 assumed to move in line with investment in construction (vol. 4, p. 230). Col. 4 (FI) refers to transport, communications, electricity, gas and water, which Ohkawa called "facilitating industries". 1885–90 from vol. 1, p. 227, and it was assumed that this sector grew at the same rate in 1874–84. Col. 5 is the subtotal of cols. 1–4. Col. 6 (OS) refers to "other services", i.e. commerce, public administration and military, education, professional services and domestic servants; estimates for 1885–90 are from vol. 1, p. 227. For 1874–84 it was assumed that two thirds of the volume of these services moved parallel to the subtotal in col. 5, and one third in line with population. Col. 7 (DRR) refers to depreciation of residential buildings and "riparian" works. LTES made no imputation for house rent; 1885–90 from vol. 1, p. 227; for 1874–84 it was assumed that DDR rose with population. Col. 8 refers to GDP and is the sum of cols. 5, 6 and 7. 

Pakistan: As for Bangladesh. 

Philippines: Population 1820–1913 from Maddison (1995 a), 1950 onwards from US Bureau of the Census. 1950–90 GDP movement from estimates of the National Statistical Coordination Board, Manila, 1990 onwards from Asian Development Bank (ADB), Key Indicators of Developing Asian and Pacific Countries, Manila updated from ADB. In Maddison (1995 a), I used the estimates of Hooley (1968) for 1913–50, which showed 1950 per capita GDP well below the 1913 level. He has since made major revisions to his 1968 estimates showing substantially better performance for 1913–50. I have provisionally assumed that the 1950 per capita GDP level was about the same as in 1913. Benchmark GDP level derived from ICP4 (see Table A3–g). 

Singapore: 1820–1998 population from same sources as for Malaysia. 1913–50 per capita GDP movement assumed to be proportionately the same as that for Malaysia. 1950–73 GDP movement from Maddison (1995 a) database, 1973–90 from World Bank, World Tables 1995 , 1990 onwards from ADB. 1990 benchmark GDP level derived from ICP 7, see Table A3–h. 

South Korea: The estimates refer to the whole of Korea for 1820–1913, South Korea for 1950 onwards. 1820–1906 population movement from T.H. Kwon and Y–H. Shin, “On Population Estimates of the Yi Dynasty, 1392–1910”, Tong–a Munhwa, 14, 1977, pp. 324–329. 1906–38 from Mizoguchi and Umemura (1988) p. 238. 1940 from Kim and Roemer (1979) p. 23.

1911–38 Korean GDP derived from T. Mizoguchi and M. Umemura, Basic Economic Statistics of Former Japanese Colonies, 1895–1938 , Toyo Keizai Shinposha, Tokyo, 1988, p. 238. They give annual estimates for two aggregate measures: gross domestic expenditure, and net domestic product at factor cost (both at 1934–6 prices). The latter showed a compound growth rate of 3.68 per cent per annum for 1913–38, the former 4.06 per cent. I used the expenditure estimate. Sang–Chul Suh, Growth and Structural Changes in the Korean Economy, 1910–40, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1978, p. 171 provides annual estimates of the net value of output for five commodity sectors (agriculture, forestry, fishery, mining, and manufacturing) for 1910–40 at 1936 prices. The aggregate measure shows slower growth for 1913–38 than Mizoguchi and Umemura (growth of 3.07 per cent per annum). I used the Suh commodity estimates together with a rough estimate for the service sector (assuming service output to move parallel to population) as a rough proxy for GDP movement for 1938–40. 1938–40 population movement from Suh, p. 41 adjusted from an end–year to mid–year basis. In 1945, the Korean economy was split into two occupation zones and the peninsula has since become two very different economies. Suh (p. 136) provided a breakdown of commodity output for his five sectors between North and South Korea for 1934, 1935, 1939 and 1940. The commodity sectors can be aggregated using the current price market shares shown on pp. 160–6. The North Korean share rose from 1934 (37.2 per cent of total commodity output) to 1940 (45.2 per cent). In the same years the Northern share of population rose from 32.4 to 33.6 per cent, so it had higher per capita commodity output than the South in 1934 and the differential had increased very substantially by 1940, owing to the concentration of Japanese investment in Northern manufacturing and mining to complement its activity in Manchukuo. Augmenting Suh’s commodity output estimates for North and South Korea by a rough adjustment for service activity, it would seem that in 1940, North Korean per capita GDP was about 49 per cent higher than that in South Korea. Kwang Suk Kim and M. Roemer, Growth and Structural Transformation, Harvard University Press, 1979, p. 35 estimate levels of commodity output by sector in South Korea in 1940 and 1953 in 1953 prices which I adjusted to a GDP basis by a rough allowance for service sector output. This link is not very satisfactory as it was made by revaluing Suh’s estimate of 1940 South Korean commodity output (in 1940 prices) at 1953 prices, using a variety of price indices, and comparing this with an independently estimated figure of 1953 commodity output in 1953 prices. It would have been more satisfactory if Kim and Roemer had been able to find quantitative indicators of volume changes between the two years. However it is the best link available in the present state of research. South Korean 1950–53 GDP movement from Maddison (1970) 300–1, 1953–70 from National Income in Korea 1975 , Bank of Korea, pp. 142–3, 1970–90 from OECD, National Accounts 1960–97 ,vol. 1, Paris, 1999. 1990 onwards from National Accounts of OECD Countries 1988–1998 , Vol. 1, 2000. 

Sri Lanka: 1820–1913 population derived from N.K. Sarkar, The Demography of Ceylon, Ceylon Government Press, Colombo, 1957, p. 22, by interpolation of his benchmark estimates for 1814–1921; 1950 onwards from US Bureau of the Census. GDP movement 1870–1950 derived from the substantial statistical Appendix of D.R. Snodgrass, 

Ceylon: An Export Economy in Transition, Irwin Illinois, 1966. Benchmark 1950 GDP at factor cost by industry of origin at 1950 prices, broken down into 14 sectors (p. 279). Annual volume movement in these sectors 1870–1950, derived as follows: export crops (tea and minor estate crops, rubber, coconut products) from pp. 357–60, food crops from cultivated area of paddy and other crops (p. 333); mining and manufacturing value added assumed to move with employment (p. 322); construction, wholesale and retail trade, banking and insurance assumed to move parallel to aggregate commodity output (in agriculture and industry); transport, communication, and utilities assumed to move parallel to movement of railway freight (p. 351). Other services (including dwellings, public administration and defence) assumed to move parallel with population. These crude estimates for 1870–1950 are provisional, and will be refined in a more careful analysis by Pierre van der Eng and myself. 1950–85 GDP movement The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective 208 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006

Taiwan: Population 1820–1990 from Maddison (1998 a) updated from ADB. 1913–90 GDP from Toshiyuki Mizoguchi, Long–Term Economic Statistics of Taiwan: 1905–1990, Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University, 1999. There are two aggregate estimates (at 1960 prices), one for gross domestic expenditure, the other for GDP by industry of origin. There is not much difference in the volume movement for 1913–51, but there is a big discrepancy thereafter. I used the volume movement shown by his expenditure measure for 1913–90 and filled the 1950 gap in this series by assuming the same proportionate movement 1950–51 as he shows in his industry of origin estimate. GDP movement from 1990 onwards from ADB. Benchmark 1990 GDP level from Summers and Heston, Penn World Tables , version 5.6.

25 East Asian Countries 

The quality of the estimates for these countries is distinctly inferior to those for the preceding group of 16 countries. 

Afghanistan: 1820–1913 population from McEvedy and Jones (1978), 1950 onwards from US Bureau of the Census. 1950–90 GDP movement from OECD Development Centre database, updated from IMF, World Economic Outlook, May 1999, p. 147. No ICP or PWT estimate of 1990 real product level was available; it was assumed that 1990 per capita GDP was 600 dollars. 

Cambodia: 1820–1913 population movement from McEvedy and Jones (1978), 1950 onwards from US Bureau of the Census. 1950–90 GDP movement and level from Maddison (1995a), p. 219 and underlying database, updated from ADB. 

Laos: 1820–1913 population movement assumed to be proportionately the same as in Vietnam, 1950 onwards from US Bureau of the Census. The output movement shown in Maddison (1995 a) for 1950–90 and for 1990–98 from ADB was based on material product rather than GDP and hence overstated growth. I have adjusted the measure to a GDP basis using the same downward adjustment coefficient as for China. 1990 benchmark GDP level from ICP7, see Table A3–h. 

Mongolia: Population 1820–1913 from McEvedy and Jones (1978), 1950 onwards from US Bureau of the Census. 1980–98 GDP movement from ADB. There are no estimates of GDP movement for 1950–80. 1950–80 per capita trend movement was assumed to be the same as in China. 1990 per capita GDP level in international dollars derived from OECD, A PPP Comparison for the NIS, Paris, February 2000, p. B–24. 

North Korea: For years before 1950, North Korea is included in the estimates for Korea as a whole. Population for 1950 onwards from US Bureau of the Census. No estimates of North Korean GDP or material product have been published for years before 1992, so any estimate is likely to be hazardous. We know that in 1940 North Korean GDP per capita was nearly 50 per cent higher than in the South (see source notes for South Korea), so it seems reasonable to suppose that 1950 North Korean per capita GDP was at least as high as in the South. N. Eberstadt, “Material progress in Korea since Partition”, in R.H. Myers, ed ., The Wealth of Nations in the Twentieth Century, Hoover Institution, 1996 is one of the best informed assessments available. He suggests that North Korea was more productive, and more rapidly developing than the South, for “many years after partition” although the military share was undoubtedly larger in the North. I have assumed that per capita GDP was the same Appendix A 209 

in the North as in the South from 1950 to 1973, with no progress to 1991. Thereafter, North Korea stopped receiving Soviet aid, and its per capita income has fallen a great deal. GDP volume movement from 1991 was as taken from M.C. Cho and H. Zang, The Present and Future Prospects of the North Korean Economy, Discussion Paper D99–3, Institute of Economic Research, Hitotsubashi University, June 1999, p. 5 (taking the Bank of Korea estimates for the 1991–2 and 1996–7 GDP movement, and the estimates which the North Korean authorities reported to the IMF for 1992–6). I assumed no change in per capita GDP from 1997 to 1998. 

Vietnam: 1913 population from Banens (2000). His estimate involved a substantial upward revision for the colonial period, using reconstitution techniques based on birth and death rates. 1820–1913 proportionate movement from McEvedy and Jones (1978). Population for 1950 onwards from US Bureau of the Census. Estimates of 1950–60 material product, using the former Soviet MPS system, were reported by the statistical authorities in Hanoi to the OECD Development Centre. I have used these estimates from the Centre’s data files. New GDP estimates for 1960–98 on an SNA basis were kindly provided by Viet Vu of the UN Statistics Division. 1990 benchmark GDP level derived from ICP 7, see Table A–3h. Jean–Pascal Bassino (Centre for International Economics and Finance, Aix–en–Provence) is conducting a major study of Vietnamese economic history for the Asian Historical Statistics Project of Hitotsubashi University using the French colonial archives. His provisional findings for 1820–1950 imply the following GDP levels, taking 1950 as 100: 1913 84.3; 1870 31.9; 1820 20.7. 

19 Small East Asian Countries: 1950–98 population from US Bureau of the Census. 1820–1950 population movement for 15 Pacific islands from McEvedy and Jones (1978), pp. 330–6; Macao 1900–50 from p. 173. 1820–1950 population for Bhutan, Maldives and Brunei assumed to move parallel to India. GDP movement in Bhutan, Brunei, Macau and Maldives for 1950–90 from Maddison (1995 a)database. Update to 1998 from IMF, except for Macau which was assumed to move as in Hong Kong. GDP movement in 15 Pacific islands 1950–90 from Maddison (1995 a) database updated from IMF for Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu, Western Samoa, Kiribati, and Micronesia; from ADB for Marshall Islands. GDP movement in French Polynesia, Guam, Pacific Islands, New Caledonia, American Samoa, Wallis and Futuna assumed to move parallel to that in the nine Pacific islands for which estimates were available.

1990 benchmark GDP levels in international dollars are from Penn World Tables for Bhutan, Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Vanuatu and Western Samoa. For ten other countries, proxy estimates were used from Maddison (1995 a) pp. 219–220. Macao per capita GDP was taken to be half of that in Hong Kong. In Brunei income levels are dominated by oil production, which was 30.7 tons per capita in 1990, about 6 per cent above that in Kuwait. It was therefore assumed that per capita income was around $6 550 (about 6 per cent higher than in Kuwait). 

15 West Asian Countries 

1820–1913 population from McEvedy and Jones (1978); 1950 onwards from US Bureau of the Census. The 1820–1913 figures shown for Israel in fact refer to Palestine (including what is now Israel, the West Bank and Gaza). Volume movement of GDP 1950–90 for Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, United Arab Emirates and Yemen from OECD Development Centre database (as in Maddison, 1995 a), thereafter from IMF, World Economic Outlook, October 1999. For all these countries, except Lebanon and Syria, the benchmark 1990 level of GDP in 1990 international (i.e. Geary–Khamis) dollars was derived from Penn World Tables version 5.6. For Syria the benchmark 1990 GDP level was derived from ICP3 (see Table A3–g). For Lebanon it is conjectural (see Maddison 1995a, p. 214). 

Iran: 1950–74 GDP volume movement from OECD Development Centre database, 1974–90 from 

World Tables 1995, 1990 onwards from IMF. Benchmark 1990 GDP level from ICP3 (see Table A3–g). 

Turkey: 1950–60 GDP volume movement from Maddison (1995 a). 1960–90 from OECD National Accounts 1960–97, Vol. 1, 1999, thereafter from National Accounts of OECD Countries 1988–1998, 

vol. 1, 2000. The new figures involve a significant revision of those in Maddison (1995 a). The Turkish authorities have revised their estimates, raising the 1990 GDP level substantially and reducing the GDP growth rate from 1968 onwards. 1990 benchmark GDP from ICP7 (see Table A3–g). 

Israel: 1950–73 GDP volume movement supplied by the Israeli Central Bureau of Statistics, 1973–90 from World Bank, World Tables 1995, 1990 onwards from IMF. Benchmark 1990 GDP derived from ICP 4 (see Table A3–g). For 1922–47 development of Palestine, see entry for the West Bank and Gaza below. 

West Bank and Gaza: These areas belonged to the old Palestinian political entity until 1948, when it was split into three parts. Israel got about 75 per cent of the territory, Jordan took over what was then a larger version of the West Bank (including Jerusalem) and Egypt took over the administration of the Gaza strip. In 1967 Israel occupied the West Bank and Gaza, and has been in the process of ceding control of parts of the West Bank to new Palestinian authority since the Oslo Peace accords. The prepartition characteristics of Palestine are analysed in J. Metzer, The Divided Economy of Mandatory Palestine, Cambridge University Press, 1998, who provides annual estimates of population and GDP for the Arab and Jewish sectors for 1922–47 (pp. 29, 217 and 242). These estimates can be extended to 1950, using the 1950 population estimates for the Jewish and non–Jewish population of Israel from D. Patinkin, The Israel Economy: the First Decade, Falk Project, Jerusalem, 1960, and estimates of 1947–50 GDP supplied by the Bank of Israel (based mainly on R. Szereszewski, Essays on the Structure of the Jewish Economy in Palestine and Israel, Falk Project, Jerusalem, 1968). From the above sources, it would appear that net domestic product and population moved as in Table A–l: Appendix A 211

From Metzer’s estimates it appears that Arab per capita income in Palestine rose from 9.83 pounds in 1922 to 24.25 in 1947. In the Jewish economy of Palestine per capita income rose from 24.6 pounds in 1922 to 63.27 in 1947. For 1950, the Bank of Israel GDP estimates cited above are not broken down into the Jewish and non–Jewish groups; but I assumed that non–Jewish real per capita income was the same in 1950 as in 1947. Applying the above 1950 proportionate shares to 1950 Israeli GDP in 1990 international dollars, it would seem that Arab GDP per capita in 1950 was about 950 international dollars. The Palestine Bureau of Statistics in Ramallah appears to have estimated GDP only in current prices for 1994 onwards. I made a proxy estimate of the trend in real product by linking the 1950 per capita level as derived above, and the 1993 level as estimated by ESCWA (Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia of the United Nations) in the study cited in Table A3–i. These two spot estimates ($950 per capita in 1950 and $4 708 in 1993) are both in 1990 international dollars. I used a logarithmic trend to interpolate between these two years, and to extrapolate from 1993 to 1998, multiplying the per capita estimates by population as estimated by the US Bureau of the Census. 

Proxy Procedure to Fill Gaps in the Dataset for 16 Asian Countries 

For 1913, there are two gaps in the GDP dataset. I assumed that the 1913–50 movement in per capita GDP in Hong Kong was parallel to that in Japan; in Nepal parallel to India (see Table A–m). For 1870, there were eight holes in the dataset. I assumed that the 1870–1913 per capita GDP movement in Hong Kong and Singapore was proportionately the same as for Japan. In the other six countries (Burma, Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines and Taiwan), it was assumed to move parallel to the average 1870–1913 per capita movement for Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand see Table A–m). For 1820, there were ten holes in the dataset. Average per capita GDP movement 1820–1870 for these ten countries was assumed to be parallel to that in Japan. 

Proxy Procedure to Fill Gaps in the Dataset for 25 East Asian and 16 West Asian Countries 

For these countries there were no GDP estimates for any of the years 1820, 1870 and 1913. It was assumed that their average per capita GDP level in 1870 and 1913 was the same as the average for the 16 East Asian countries, and that their 1820 level was the same as in 1870.

Proportionate Importance of the Proxy Estimates 

For 1913, the proxy estimates represented 7.8 per cent of the Asian GDP total, for 1870, 11.2 per cent and for 1820, 9.5 per cent. Proxy estimates are contestable, as different analysts may have different ideas about how to fill the gaps. However, the proxy proportion is relatively modest, so the all–Asia results are not too sensitive to variations in procedure. The main task of further research is to fill the gaps by direct estimation, which seems likely to be feasible in a number of cases (see note above on Vietnam). Table A–m.

Turkey 1993 from Purchasing Power Parities and Real Expenditures: GK Results, 1993, vol.2 (1996), p. 35 (adjusted to a US PPP = 1.00). All these PPP converters are multilateral and use the Geary–Khamis method of estimation. The results for China were derived from a 1987 bilateral China/United States comparison, adjusted to a Geary–Khamis basis as described in Maddison, Chinese Economic Performance in the Long Run (1998), pp. 153–4, with upward adjustment of the official Chinese GDP estimates in yuan. Column 3 is derived from columns 1 and 2. Column 4 was derived by adjusting column 3 for the volume movement in GDP between the reference year and 1990. Column 5 is column 4 adjusted by the movement in the US GDP deflator from the reference year to 1990.

Source: Column 1 from ADB, Key Indicators of Developing Asian and Pacific Countries, 1999. In most cases these involve minor revisions of the figures cited by ESCAP, except for Singapore, where the figure is 13 per cent lower. ESCAP used an adjusted version of the Geary–Khami procedure. The estimates for Malaysia and Laos were made by the World Bank and used reduced information techniques (see ESCAP 

Comparisons of Real Gross Product and Purchasing Power Parities 1993) . ESCAP took Hong Kong as the numeraire country, and the Hong Kong figures were reported without a PPP adjustment. In column 2 above I derived the implicit 1993 Hong Kong PPP in terms o Hong Kong dollars per US dollar by updating the 1990 result shown in Table A3–g. For other countries ESCAP reported PPP in terms o units of national currency per Hong Kong dollar. In column 2 these PPPs were multiplied by the 1993 Hong Kong/US dollar PPP, to link these regional results to the global ICP exercises in which the United States is the numeraire country. Column 3 is derived from columns 1 and 2. Column 4 was derived by adjusting column 3 for the change in the volume movement of GDP between 1990 and 1993. Column 5 is column 4 adjusted by the movement in the US GDP deflator between 1990 and 1993. Table A3–i.

This study presented figures for 8 West Asian countries and Egypt for 1993. It used a short–cut, "reduced information" approach, using both the Geary–Kham is and the EKS approach. It should be regarded as a first approximation to a full ICP exercise. The results for some of the countries such as Lebanon and Yemen seemed implausible, so I used the results for only three of the countries. Fourth column derived by adjusting column 3 for the change in the volume of GDP between 1990 and 1993. Column 5 adjusts the column 4 entry for the movement in the US GDP deflator between 1990 and 1993.

# Population, GDP and GDP Per Capita in 57 African Countries 

Population 1950 onwards from the International Programs Centre, US Bureau of the Census, which provides comprehensive coverage of the African countries on an annual basis back to 1950. Its estimates are updated and revised regularly. Use of this source involved some significant modifications of the figures used in Maddison (1995 a), which were a mixture of OECD Development Centre and World Bank sources. 1913 population for the four sample countries from Maddison (1995 a). 1820– 1913 total African population derived from McEvedy and Jones (1978), p. 206. Estimates of benchmark 1990 GDP levels in international (Geary–Khamis) dollars were available for 50 African countries from the Penn World Tables of Robert Summers and Alan Heston. In Maddison (1995 a), I used the PWT 5.5 estimates. Here I use the 5.6 version. Table A4–g provides a confrontation of the PWT results and those of the three ICP rounds which cover 24 countries. There are seven countries for which no ICP or PWT benchmark was available. For Equatorial Guinea, Mayotte, St. Helena, S. Tome Principe and Western Sahara, 1990 per capita GDP was assumed to be equal to the average for the 50 countries covered by the PWT. For Libya it was assumed to be the same as in Algeria, and for Eritrea the same as Ethiopia. 1990–98 GDP movement for all African countries from IMF, World Economic Outlook, October 1999. GDP movement 1913–90 for Egypt, Ghana, Morocco and South Africa from the sources cited below; 1950–90 GDP movement for other countries (except Botswana, Nigeria and the seven proxy estimates) from the database of the OECD Development Centre. 

Egypt: 1913–50 GDP from Hansen and Marzouk (1965), p. 3, 1950–73 from Ikram (1980) p. 398–9; 1973–90 from World Bank, World Tables, 1995. 

Ghana: GDP 1913–50 from Szereszewski (1965) pp. 74, 92 and 149; 1950–5 from Maddison (1970); 1955–90 from the Government Statistical Service, Republic of Ghana. 

Morocco: 1913–50 GDP derived from Amin (1966), 1950–90 GDP from World Bank, World Tables (1983 and 1995 editions). 

South Africa: 1913–20 current price GDP divided by cost of living index from Bureau of Census and Statistics, Union Statistics for Fifty Years, Jubilee Issue 1910–1960, Pretoria, 1960; 1920–50 from L.J. Fourie, “Contribution of Factors of Production and Productivity to South African Economic Growth”, IARIW, processed, 1971. 1946–70 GDP at 1975 prices from Development Bank of South Africa, 1970– 90 from World Bank, World Tables. 

Botswana: GDP movement in 1950–90 from World Bank, World Tables. 

Nigeria: 1950–90 from Bevan, Collier and Gunning (1999). Estimates for the 15 “non–sample” countries are segregated as they are extremely shaky. 1913–50 per capita GDP for Africa assumed to move parallel to the average for the four countries for which estimates were available. Before 1913 no indicators were available. As a proxy it was assumed that per capita GDP for Africa as a whole moved at the same pace as in “other Asia” (see Table B–21), for 1820–1913.

Heston, "The Penn World Table (Mark 5): An Expanded Set of International Comparisons, 1950–1988", Quarterly Journal of Economics, May 1991. Col. 2 from their diskette of version 5.6a of January 1995. In some cases the PWT estimate referred to a year or two earlier than 1990, and I updated using the volume movement of GDP, and the change in the US GDP deflator between that year and 1990. I used the PWT version 5.5 for 50 countries earlier (see Maddison, 1995 a, p. 192 and 221), and here have used version 5.6a. This raised the GDP aggregate for the 50 countries from 812 817 million international (Geary–Khamis) dollars in Maddison (1995 a) to 845 908 million here. In addition, there were proxy estimates for six countries amounting to $13 883 million int.dollars in both exercises (see Maddison, 1995 a, pp. 214 and 221). The PWT estimates are much more comprehensive than those of the ICP, which covered 15 countries for 1980 (ICP 4), 22 countries in ICP 5 for 1985 and ICP 7 for 1993. There was no ICP 6 round for 1990 for Africa. The ICP results were adjusted to a 1990 basis in the same fashion as those in Tables A3–g and A3–h. The 24 countries shown here include all of those which participated in one or other of the ICP exercises. ICP 4 results are from UN/Eurostat, World Comparisons of Purchasing Power Parity and Real Product for 1980, New York, 1987, p. viii; ICP 5 from UN/Eurostat, World Comparisons of Real GDP and Purchasing Power 1985, 

New York, 1994, p. 5; ICP 7 Geary–Khamis results from Eurostat, Comparisons of Price Levels and Economic Aggregates 1993: The Results of 22 African Countries, Luxembourg 1996, pp. 43, 145–6. The ICP 7 results in the last column are not comparable with those for earlier years. They are intra–African relatives linked to the US dollar via a standardised exchange rate rather than a purchasing power parity with the United States as the numeraire country. As a result they show real product levels which are in the aggregate aout one third of those in the ICP 5 exercise. The ratio of the ICP 7 to ICP 5 results varies from .46 for Botswana to .17 for Cameroon. The ICP 5 result for Cameroon is, in fact, rather odd. However, for the biggest countries, the ratio varies from .17 for Nigeria to .34 for Egypt. A major problem with the ICP exercise is that there is no attempt to reconcile discrepancies between the results of different rounds, whereas this is a fundamental feature of the Summers and Heston approach in the Penn World Tables.

# Growth of World Population, GDP and GDP Per Capita before 1820 

Maddison (1995 a) contained a rough aggregate estimate of world population, GDP and per capita GDP back to 1500 to provide perspective for the detailed analysis of developments after 1820. The main purpose of the brief look backwards was to emphasise the dramatic acceleration of growth in the succeeding capitalist epoch. Maddison (1998 a) provided a confrontation of Chinese and Western economic performance over a longer period of two millennia. This demonstrated important differences in the pace and pattern of change in major parts of the world economy, which have roots deep into the past. The present exercise provides a more detailed and disaggregated scrutiny of the protocapitalist experience from 1500 to 1820, with a rough sketch of the contours of development over the preceding millennium and a half. The quantitative analysis in this appendix works backward from the 1820 estimates in Appendix A, using the same techniques of analysis — assembling evidence on changes in population, retaining the 1990 international dollar as the temporal and spatial anchor in the estimation of movements in GDP and per capita GDP, filling holes in the evidence with proxy estimates in order to derive world totals. This appendix is divided into two parts. The first deals with population. The second with GDP growth. 

P OPULATION 

The evidence here on the more distant past is weaker than that in Appendix A, and there are more gaps in the database. Nevertheless, the exercise in quantification is not a product of fantasy. The strongest and most comprehensive evidence is that for population, and the population component is of greater proportionate importance in analysis of centuries when per capita income growth was exiguous. Demographic material is important in providing clues to per capita income development. One striking example is the urbanisation ratio. Thanks to the work of de Vries for Europe and of Rozman for Asia, one can measure the proportion of population living in towns with more than 10 000 inhabitants. In the year 1000, this ratio was zero in Europe (there were only 4 towns with more than 10 000 inhabitants) and in China it was 3 per cent. By 1800 the West European urban ratio was 10.6 per cent, the Chinese 3.8 per cent and the Japanese 12.3 per cent. When countries are able to expand their urban ratios, it indicates that there was a growing surplus beyond subsistence in agriculture, and that the non–agricultural component of economic activity was increasing. These changes were used to infer differences in per capita progress between China and Europe in Maddison (1998 a), and such inference is a feature of the present study. The Chinese bureaucracy kept population registers which go back more than 2 000 years. These bureaucratic records were designed to assess taxable capacity, and The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 230 

include information on cultivated area and crop production, which was used by Perkins (1969) to assess long run movements in Chinese GDP per capita. Bagnall and Frier (1994) have made brilliant use of fragments of ancient censuses to estimate occupational structure, household size, marriage patterns, fertility and life expectation in Roman Egypt of the third century. Serious work on historical demography started in the seventeenth century with John Graunt (1662). He derived vital statistics, survival tables, and the population of London by processing and analysing christenings and burials recorded in the London bills of mortality from 1603 onwards. Halley (1693) published the first rigorous mathematical analysis of life tables and Gregory King (1696) derived estimates of the population of England and Wales by exploiting information from hearth and poll taxes, a new tax on births, marriages and burials and his own minicensuses for a few towns. Historical demography gained new vigour in the twentieth century in several important centres: 

a) the Office of Population Research in Princeton University (established in 1936); b) INED (Institut National des Études Demographiques) founded in the 1950s to exploit family reconstitution techniques developed by Louis Henry; c) the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Family Structure (established in the 1970s) has carried out a massive research project to reconstitute English population size and structure on an annual basis back to 1541 (Wrigley, et al ., 1997); d) research on Japanese population history has blossomed under the leadership of Akira Hayami and Osamu Saito; e) there has been a flood of publications on Latin American demography from the University of California by members of the Berkeley school. For the second half of the twentieth century we have the comprehensive international surveys of the United Nations, and the US Bureau of the Census. As a result there are now a large number of monographic studies on European, American and Asian countries, and a long series of efforts to construct aggregative estimates of world population. Riccioli (1672) and Gregory King (1696) inaugurated this tradition. Early estimates are usefully surveyed by Willcox (1931) who listed 66 publications between 1650 and 1850. Modern scholarship is represented by Colin Clark (1967), Durand (1974), McEvedy and Jones (1978) and Biraben (1979). The following detailed estimates for 1500 onwards rely heavily on monographic country studies for the major countries. To fill holes in my dataset I draw on McEvedy and Jones (1978). For the preceding millennium and a half, I used their work extensively. There are several reasons for preferring McEvedy and Jones rather than Clark, Durand and Biraben. The McEvedy and Jones estimates are the most detailed and best documented. When reconstructing the past, they define countries in terms of 1975 boundaries, which are in most cases identical with the 1990 boundaries I adopted as a general rule (with exceptions for Germany, India, Korea and the United Kingdom). They also show the impact of frontier changes. There are significant differences of judgement amongst the four standard sources on long term population momentum, particularly for Latin America for 1500 and earlier, and for Africa. In both these cases my judgement was closer to that of McEvedy and Jones, than to that of Clark, Durand or Biraben. Table B–1 summarises my aggregate findings compared with those of McEvedy and Jones, Clark, Durand and Biraben.

Western Offshoots 

There is a detailed bibliography and survey of the literature on North America in Daniels (1992). Thornton (1987) analyses the process of indigenous depopulation, and cites Ubelaker’s (1976) estimates for the Smithsonian Institution. I took a rounded version of the latter as the basis for my estimate of 2 million in 1500 for the United States, and quarter of a million for Canada. Thornton gives no estimates for 1600 and 1700. My assessment for these two years is based on the assumption that the depopulation ratio was smaller than in Mexico (where population density was much greater). Movement of population for 0–1500 assumed to be proportionately the same as the total for Latin America. For Australia, the conventional official estimate of the aboriginal population at the time of initial contact with Europeans was 250–300 thousand, but Butlin’s (1983) detailed modelling of the likely impact of disease, displacement and deliberate extermination in New South Wales and Victoria suggested a considerably higher figure. I assumed a pre–contact population in Australia and New Zealand combined of 550 000 — smaller than Butlin’s estimate but bigger than the old official estimates. For 0–1500 I assumed slower growth than in the Americas. 

Latin America 

The size of the indigenous population at the time of the Spanish conquest is a matter of considerable controversy. Firm evidence is weak, but there are two very distinct schools of thought. It is clear that population declined substantially after the conquest. The native population had been isolated over millennia from foreign microbes, and suffered from major epidemics of smallpox, measles and other deadly diseases against which they had no immunities. 

## Mexico 

In an assessment based on a careful survey of literary evidence of the conquistadores and documents in Spanish archives, Angel Rosenblat (1945) estimated the pre–conquest population of present day Mexico to have been about 4.5 million. He assumed a rather modest rate of depopulation after the conquest — a drop less than 15 per cent in the sixteenth century. The Berkeley school (Cook and Simpson, 1948) had very much higher estimates of the pre–conquest population — their figure for Central Mexico alone (about a quarter of the territory of present day Mexico) was 11 million. This estimate was based on various flimsy suppositions, e.g. multiplying the number of Franciscan monks by baptismal coefficients or inferring population from the size of Aztec armies as estimated by those who fought them. The Borah and Cook (1963) estimate for Central Mexico was even higher — 25 million on the basis of ambiguous pictographs describing the incidence of Aztec fiscal levies. They assumed a 95 per cent depopulation ratio for the indigenous population between 1519 and 1605, and backcast Spanish estimates for 1605 by a multiplier of 25. They give no detailed specification of the different causes of mortality as Butlin (1983) did for Australia. They did not discuss alternative approaches to measurement as Cook (1981) does for Peru, and they never made an adequate response to Rosenblat’s (1967) criticism of their work. The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 234 

There are two reasons for scepticism about the extremely high mortality estimates of the Berkeley school: a) they assume very much higher mortality than European experience in the wake of the Black Death (a one third loss); b) it is implausible that Central Mexican population did not recover its alleged 1519 level until 1970 in spite of the additions the Spanish conquest made to production potential. Before the conquest there were no wheeled vehicles, no ploughs and no metal tools. The basic diet was close to vegetarianism with no cattle, sheep, pigs or hens. The absence of horses, donkeys, oxen and wheeled vehicles meant that land transport possibilities were confined to human porterage. Europe recovered from the Black Death mortality within a century with virtually no change in technology. It seems inconceivable that Mexican recovery took 450 years. My own judgement is that Berkeley School‘s estimates for Mexico are far too high. However, I think Rosenblat understates the pre–conquest level and the subsequent rate of depopulation. Zambardino (1980), in a critical review of the Berkeley School, suggests a plausible range of 5–10 million. I took the midpoint of the Zambardino estimate for Mexico (see the discussion in Maddison, 1995b), and assumed a depopulation ratio of two thirds between 1500 and 1600. Rosenblat (1945) describes the structure of the Mexican population in 1825, at the end of Spanish rule when the total population was 6.8 million. At the top of the scale was a thin layer of 70 000 peninsulares (peninsular Spaniards). The second group consisted of 1.2 million criollos (whites of Spanish extraction). The third group consisted of 1.9 million mestizos or castas . Most of them originated from unions between whites and Indians, some were Indians who had abandoned their rural lifestyle, wore Spanish–type clothes and lived in urban areas. At the bottom of the social scale were rural Indians (3.7 million) living mostly in nucleated pueblos, engaged in subsistence agriculture, with some hunter–gatherer groups in the North. This group wore traditional dress, maintained their own languages and customs except religion. There was a small group (about 10 000) of negro slaves in the South of the country. This information on social structure is of considerable use in constructing income accounts (see below). 

## Brazil 

I adopted the Rosenblat (1945) estimate for 1500 which was used by McEvedy and Jones. It is close to the Kroeber (1939) estimate based on hypotheses about the nature of land use and technology by a population who were mainly hunter–gatherers (with some slash and burn agriculture in coastal regions). Hemming (1978) estimates a pre–contact population of 2.4 million (a figure he describes as “pure guess–work”) derived by blowing up present day figures for 28 regions by assumed depopulation ratios. Denevan (1976) estimates 4.8 million for North and Central Brazil (including Amazonia) but this was based on agricultural potential and inferences from evidence on Peru. Hemming exaggerates the likely depopulation ratio for a country with a thinly settled hunter–gatherer population, and Denevan’s reliance on estimates of agricultural potential is not relevant for an Indian population who were predominantly hunter–gatherers. In the first century of settlement it became clear that it was difficult to use Indians as serf or slave labour. They were not docile, had high mortality when exposed to Western diseases, could run away and hide very easily. So the Portuguese imported large numbers of African slaves for manual labour. The ultimate fate of Brazilian Indians was like that of North American Indians. They were pushed beyond the bounds of colonial society. The main difference was greater miscegenation with the white invaders and black slaves. Appendix B 235

## Peru 

I adopted Cook’s (1981, Chapter 7) “minimal” estimate of 4 million. Although he calls it “minimal” he cites lower figures derived by other methods he considers respectable. Cook’s approach is like that of the Berkeley school, but he shows alternative estimates derived from a) the “ecological” approach, which assesses population potential (carrying capacity) in terms of resources and the technology available; b) inferences from the extent of archaelogical remains; c) retropolation of assumed depopulation ratios from 1571 when the first reasonably documented Spanish population estimates became available. Cook opts for a pre–conquest figure of 9 million (p. 114) which is near the top of the wide range he shows. I assumed the same depopulation ratio of two thirds between 1500 and 1600, as I did for Mexico. 

Other Latin American Countries 

I adopted the pre–conquest estimates of McEvedy and Jones (1978) which they derive to a large degree from Rosenblat (1945). I assume a higher depopulation ratio for the sixteenth century than McEvedy and Jones, but less than that for Mexico and Peru (see Table B–5). 

Total Latin American Population 

Table B–5 compares my estimates, those of McEvedy and Jones and Rosenblat. Mine are higher for 1500 and show bigger depopulation in the sixteenth century, but the differences are modest compared with the Berkeley school. Borah (1976) suggested a population of 100 million upwards for the Americas as a whole in 1500. Colin Clark (1967) and Biraben (1979) were impressed by Borah but obviously felt he exaggerated and adopted compromise estimates (without entering into country detail). 

China 

Chinese population estimates (see Table B–8) are based on bureaucratic records which go much further back than those in any other country. The type of adjustments which are necessary for intertemporal compatibility are discussed in detail in Bielenstein (1987) and Ho (1959). I have used Ho (1970) p.49 for the population in 2A.D. For 960 onwards see Maddison, 1998 a, Appendix D, pp. 167– 9. Recently (in volume 8 of the Cambridge History of China), Martin Heidra offered a totally different picture of Chinese population with very rapid growth during the Ming dynasty. However, he provides no detail or bibliographic evidence for his revisionism, and shows no decline in the mid seventeenth century wars between the Ming and their Ch’ing successors. His analysis ends in 1650, and his high hypothesis leaves virtually no room for any growth in the Ch’ing period (see Heidra in Twitchett and Mote, 1998, pp. 436–40). It is therefore difficult to give much credence to his views.

India 

India does not have statistical records of the same sort as Western Europe, China or Japan, and there is consequently a wide range of views. A good deal of discussion has hinged on the year 1600, for which Moreland estimated 100 million, Davis (1951) 125 million, Habib (1982) around 145 million (a range of 140–150). Virtually all of these estimates are based on an assessment of the productive capacity of the cultivated area (see Raychaudhuri and Habib, 1982), so there is an interdependence between what one assumes about demographic and economic performance. I took an average of the Davis and Habib estimate for 1600. For the year 0, I used the estimates of Durand. 

Japan 

Reasonably firm evidence is available from 1721 onwards from national population surveys at six–yearly intervals. These were taken for the shogun’s own domains and those of approximately 250 

daimyo in the rest of Japan. The registers excluded samurai households, the imperial nobility, outcastes and beggars ( eta and hinin ). They understated the female population and (to a degree which varied between different domains) young children as well. Nevertheless they can be adjusted to provide reasonable estimates for 1721 onwards when the aggregate level was about 30 million. Before the six– yearly surveys were instituted, information was available from annual registers of religious affiliation which were instituted after the Portuguese were expelled from Japan and Christianity was made illegal. Hayami (1986 a) shows such retrospective daimyo returns for 17 areas for periods varying from 30 to 100 years before the 1730s. Together they covered about 17 per cent of the Japanese population in the 1730s. They show an arithmetic average growth rate of 0.35 per cent a year, and a weighted average of 0.52 per cent. When these rates are backcast they suggest a 1600 population between 16 and 19.7 million, which is close to the Yoshida (1911) estimate of 18.5 million. Yoshida based his estimate on the 1598 cadastral survey which showed 18.5 million koku of grain output. He assumed this would support a population of 18.5 million with a consumption of 1 koku (150 kg.) per head. Yoshida’s reasoning was crude but seems more plausible than Hayami’s (1986 a) range of 10 to 14 million for 1600. Hayami implies a very rapid growth in the seventeenth century with an abrupt change to more or less complete stagnation in the eighteenth century. 

Korea 

Korea had a system of household population registers ( hojok ) for purposes of taxation and manpower mobilisation from 1392 to 1910, from which bureaucratic records survive. These registers had very scanty coverage of the child population, there was substantial regional variance, with much better coverage in Seoul, the capital. Kwon (1993) adjusted these records with the help of other historical Table B–7. Alternative Estimates of Japanese Population, 0–1820 A.D.

For 1500–1600 I assume the same growth rate as Hayami (0.18 per cent a year).

documents, and information on family structure from the first modern census of 1925. Kwon and Shin (1977) provide annual estimates for 1392 to 1910. I used their estimates of population movement for 1500, 1600, 1700 and 1910 and linked them to estimates of the 1910 level from Mizoguchi and Umemura (1988) as described in Appendix A. The revised estimates are about twice as high as those used in McEvedy and Jones (1978) which were based on the unadjusted results of the population registers as reported in Lee (1936), pp. 40–1. For 0–1500 I assumed the same proportionate movement as in Japan. 

Africa 

Except for Egypt there is virtually no documentation on African population. The available estimates are speculative. The first were by Riccioli, an Italian Jesuit, in 1672. He suggested a population of 100 million in his day without explaining the derivation. Gregory King (1696) estimated 70 million, starting with the land area of the continent and a rough assessment of agricultural productivity to estimate what population could be sustained with the available natural resources, levels of technique and organisation. The leading American demographer Walter Willcox (1931) thought Riccioli’s estimate was plausible and assumed no change in seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Colin Clark (1967) did the same. Carr–Saunders (1964) accepted Riccioli’s estimate for the mid–seventeenth century and allowed for some decline thereafter because of the slave trade. Biraben (1979) also allowed for some decline due to the slave trade. Durand (1974) and McEvedy and Jones (1978) took a very different view. Working backwards from their estimated population level in 1900, they assumed a more dynamic growth process. They took a position on the interaction between population pressure and production which is nearer to that of Boserup (1965 and 1981), than to the Malthusian constraints which the other school had in mind. The hypothesis of McEvedy and Jones seems the more plausible, and I adopted their estimates for 0–1913. Table B–8. Population of Asia, 0–1820 A.D.

McEvedy and Jones (1978) is the only source which provides a detailed analysis of the population of Africa. The most striking aspect of their estimates is the dynamism of the expansion south of the Sahara, and the very large decline in the North African share from about half of the African total in the first century to about one seventh in 1820 (see Table B–9b). For about four millennia Egypt was virtually the only area to practise agriculture, and the rest of the continent was sparsely inhabited by hunter– gatherer populations. In the last millennium B.C., Phoenicians and Greeks settled in North Africa west of Egypt, established cities and brought in sophisticated agricultural techniques. By the first century the whole of the prosperous Mediterranean littoral was under Roman control. Its economy and population declined after the Roman collapse, revived with the seventh century Arab takeover, reaching a new peak around the year 1000 A.D. The dynamic expansion south of the Sahara was due to the spread of agriculturalists into East and Southern Africa, pushing out hunter—gatherer populations. The introduction of manioc and maize from the Americas in the sixteenth century reinforced the possibilities of agricultural expansion. The introduction of agriculture made it possible to accommodate a substantial increase in population, but per capita income probably did not change much.

The slave trade had a substantial effect on African population growth (see Tables 1–7 and 2–5 and the analysis in Chapter 2). Between 1600 and 1870 more than 9 million slaves were shipped to the Americas. The peak was in the eighteenth century when arrivals in the Americas were over 6 million, and African losses were bigger owing to mortality on the passage. Without this trade, African population growth in the eighteenth century might well have been three times as fast. Appendix B 241

GDP AND GDP P ER C APITA , 1500–1820 

Maddison (1995 a) pp. 19–20 contained a very crude estimate of the movement of world economic growth from 1500 to 1820, as a supplement to the much more detailed analysis for 1820 onwards. In that study I used three simple hypotheses about the growth of real GDP per capita. For Western Europe it was assumed to rise by 0.2 per cent a year, following the hypothesis of Kuznets (1973), 0.1 per cent a year in the rest of Europe and Latin America, and with zero change in Asia and Africa. Maddison (1998 a), pp. 25 and 40 compared the contours of development in China and Europe from the first century of our era to 1995. The evidence for China was examined in considerable detail, but the estimates for Europe contained a large element of conjecture. This appendix involves a much more detailed scrutiny of the evidence for 1500–1820. It strongly suggests that average per capita West European growth rate was slower (at 0.15 per cent a year) from 1500 to 1820 than the 0.2 per cent which Kuznets hypothesised. Growth was faster in Latin America and in the Western offshoots than was assumed in Maddison (1995 a). The hypothesis of a stagnant level of per capita income in Asia is generally confirmed, but Japan is a significant exception. The last section of this appendix includes rough and tentative estimates of GDP levels by major regions for the first century of our era and for the year 1000. Estimates of world GDP and per capita GDP are set out in Tables B–18 to B–22. 

Western Europe Belgium 

Blomme and Van der Wee (1994) provide estimates (for Flanders and Brabant) of GDP by industry of origin for 1510–1812. They give estimates for seven points within the period, which I used to derive approximate estimates for 1500,1600 and 1700. 

## France 

François Perroux, with encouragement and support from Simon Kuznets, set up a group to measure French growth in the 1950s (Marczewski and Toutain were its most productive members). Marczewski (1961) made some preliminary estimates of growth for the eighteenth century which greatly exaggerated industrial performance. These have now been superseded. J.C. Toutain kindly provided me with the revised estimates which I have used here for 1700–1820. Over the past few decades French economic history has been dominated by members of the 

Annales school who have been rather disdainful of the Kuznetsian approach. From our point of view, there are three main drawbacks to their work: a) disinterest in macroquantification; b) concentration on regional or supranational characterisations rather than national performance; c) Malthusian bias. Le Roy Ladurie strongly emphasized the long–term stability of the French economy from 1300 to 1700, both in demographic and per capita terms. He first put forward the thesis of stagnant income in a regional study of the peasants of Languedoc (1966) . He argued that there was a tension between the dynamism of population and the rigidity of the agricultural production potential which led to recurrent and prolonged population setbacks. In 1977 he maintained the same conclusions in a survey drawing on a new generation of regional studies. Appendix B 245 

Braudel’s pessimism at one time went further than that of Le Roy Ladurie. In a 1967 article with Spooner, he concluded, after summarising the work of Phelps Brown and other real wage analysts and regional studies of the Annales school that: “From the late fifteenth century until well into the beginning of the eighteenth century, the standard of living in Europe progressively declined.” Later he changed his mind (Braudel, 1985, Vol.III, p. 314): “Visualizing overall quantities throws into relief clear continuities in European history. The first of these is the regular rise in GNP come hell or high water — if Frank Spooner is correct, France’s GNP had been rising since the reign of Louis XII and probably even longer.” [Louis XII reigned from 1498 to 1515]. My own view is that Braudel’s revised judgement is more acceptable than his earlier position, or that of Le Roy Ladurie. However, the graph which Braudel reproduced from Spooner (1972) did not show real GNP, but the movement in value from 1500 to 1800 of a fixed quantity of wheat, multiplied by population, and by a smoothed index of wheat prices in Paris. The quantitative evidence for assessing aggregate French performance from 1500 to 1700 is therefore still quite weak. Judging from the comparative growth of the urban population ratio (Table B–14), it seems clear that French economic growth was slower than that of England. I have assumed that French per capita growth 1500–1700 was about the same as in Belgium. 

## Italy 

Malanima (1995, p. 600) suggests declining per capita income in Italy for 1570–1700, and stability from 1700 to 1820. These conclusions are based on a variety of indicators of industrial and commercial activity in cities, levels of food consumption and real wages, rather than an articulate estimate of GDP movement. The nature of the approach is explained in his short essay, “Italian Economic Performance: Output and Income 1600–1800” in Maddison and van der Wee (1994). Malanima’s assumption of a decline up to 1700 fits with the qualitative indicators and assessment of Cipolla (1976, pp. 236–244), who suggests decline from the late fifteenth to seventeenth century. However, there is some dissent on this in Sella’s (1979) assessment of seventeenth century development in Spanish Lombardy (centred in Milan) and Rapp’s (1976) judgement on the seventeenth century situation in Venice. Both Sella and Rapp assumed some relative decline compared with more dynamic economies in Northern Europe, but not an absolute decline. I assumed that Italian per capita income was stagnant from 1500 to 1820. Italian population growth was slower than that in the rest of Europe and the urban ratio showed little change from 1500 to 1820. 

## The Netherlands 

Estimates of GDP growth for 1580–1820 are from Maddison (1991 a) pp. 205 and 277. They are linked at 1820 to new estimates for 1820–1913 by Smits, Horlings and van Zanden (2000). For 1580– 1700, GDP movement was inferred from evidence (on explosive urbanisation, the transformation of the rural economy, and the size of household assets as revealed by probate inventories) provided in de Vries (1974). Van Zanden (1987) presented a wide variety of evidence to document his estimates of agricultural and fishery production, industry, transport and services for 1650–1805. The Dutch estimates show rapid growth to 1700, and a significant fall per capita from 1700 to 1820. De Vries and van der Woude (1997), p. 707 give a graphical representation based on alternative assumptions about the decline of Dutch per capita income from its peak to the nadir at the end of the Napoleonic wars. Their profile is not markedly different from the measure I adopted. I interpolated the 1580–1700 per capita growth rate of 0.43 to derive the estimates for 1600, and assumed that the 1500 level was below that of Belgium. The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 246 

## United Kingdom 

1700–1820 GDP growth from Maddison (1991 a), p. 220, modified for England and Wales to incorporate the results of Crafts and Harley (1992) rather than Crafts 1983). I assumed that Scottish per capita GDP was three–quarters of the level in England and Wales in 1801 and that its movement 1700– 1801 was parallel to the Crafts–Harley estimate for England and Wales. For Ireland 1700–1801 per capita income was assumed to rise half as fast as in England and Wales. For 1500–1700 there are several indicators which suggest that the United Kingdom was more dynamic than most other European countries. Population rose by 0.39 per cent a year compared with 0.15 per cent in the rest of Western Europe. The urban population ratio (population in cities 10 000 and over as a percentage of total population) rose from 3.1 to 13.3 per cent in England and Wales — about twice as fast as in France or the Netherlands. It seems clear that the ratio of foreign trade to GDP increased from 1500 to 1820. There are no satisfactory aggregate measures of crop output back to 1500 (see Overton, 1996), but the evidence on yields per acre in Clark (1991), on labour productivity in Allen (1991), and occupational structure (Wrigley, 1988) help to explain the growing urban ratio, as per capita crop availability was maintained with a decreasing share of the labour force. The faster growth in animal husbandry than crops (Wrigley, 1988) suggests an improvement in diets. Recent research on the growing variety of consumption items, improvements in housing and increased stocks of furniture and household linen revealed by probate inventories for successive generations also demonstrates a long process of improvement in living standards — see chapters by de Vries, Wills, and Shammas in Brewer and Porter (1993). For these reasons, it seemed reasonable to assume that the Crafts–Harley rate of growth of per capita income for 1700–1801 was also valid for 1500–1700. For Ireland I assumed per capita growth was half as fast. For the United Kingdom as a whole this implies a per capita growth rate of 0.28 per cent a year for 1500–1700. Snooks (1993) estimated the growth of total and per capita income in England 1086–1688 by linking the nominal income assessments in the Domesday Book survey of rural England south of the river Tees with Gregory King’s estimates for 1688 as adjusted by Lindert and Williamson (1982). He deflated nominal income growth with the price index for household consumables of Phelps Brown and Hopkins (1981), pp. 28–30, supplemented by an index of wheat prices from Thorold Rogers. His estimates imply a growth rate of per capita real income averaging 0.35 per cent a year from 1492 to 1688 (p. 24). At this rate per capita income would have doubled from 1500 to 1700. This is faster growth than I have suggested. The estimates of per capita GDP in Table B–13 show a very different movement from the frequently quoted real wage index for building workers in Southern England of Phelps Brown and Hopkins (1981). From 1500 to 1800 they suggested that real wages fell by 60 per cent, whereas I show per capita real GDP increasing 2.4 fold. The tradition in real wage measurement is quite simplistic compared with that in demography or national accounts. Phelps Brown and Hopkins use daily wage rates for craftsmen and labourers hired for building work by Oxford and Cambridge colleges, Eton school and some other employers in Southern England. For the most part they had 15 or more wage quotations a year for craftsmen, and about 3 a year for building labourers. For the period 1500–1800, in which we are most interested, there were 82 years for which they show no wage estimate because of wide variance in the quotes they had or absence of data. They have no data for weekly or annual earnings, or days worked. There is no discussion in Phelps Brown and Hopkins of the representativity of their wage index for building workers. Lindert and Williamson (1982, p. 393), show that 5.3 per cent of families (73 000) derived their livelihood from the building trades in 1688. Even if the Phelps Brown coverage of this group is assumed to be adequate, and even if it is reasonable to assume that building workers were paid mainly in cash and not in kind, this is certainly not true of the bulk of the working population. Appendix B 247 

People employed in agriculture were 56 per cent of the total in 1700, and most of them were producing and directly consuming cereals, meat, butter and cheese which figure so largely in the price index. Many others such as servants, artisans, the clergy, the armed forces were either not wage earners or received an appreciable part of their remuneration in kind. A large part of the working population were thus sheltered from the impact of price rises. Jan de Vries (1993) is very critical of the real wage approach compared with alternative quantitative methods of measuring well–being. He questions the representativity of construction worker experience in a society with wide income differences. He emphasises the large number of important items left out of the Phelps Brown index and its use of fixed weights for such a long period, but his strongest doubts arise from the conflict between its sombre conclusions with evidence of a different kind which he found in probate inventories “All the studies I have examined for colonial New England and the Chesapeake, England and the Netherlands consistently reveal two features. With very few exceptions, each generation of decedents from the mid– seventeenth to the late eighteenth century left behind more and better possessions.” Table B–13.

Aggregate Performance in the West European Core 

The aggregate per capita growth rate for the five countries (Belgium, France, Italy, Netherlands and the United Kingdom) where I have given estimates for 1500–1820 is 0.14 per cent per annum, but they are a rather mixed bunch. The growth rate in the United Kingdom was 0.27, the Netherlands 0.28, France 0.16, Belgium 0.13 and zero in Italy. In fact the United Kingdom and the Netherlands are special cases of fast growth. Italian stagnation was also atypical (as is clear from the stability in its urban ratio), and there were special forces retarding Belgian growth. Belgian growth was adversely affected by the break with the Netherlands. Belgium was one of the most prosperous areas of Europe in 1500, as a centre of international trade and banking and substantial textile production. After the Netherlands became independent, the port of Antwerp was blockaded for two centuries, there was substantial migration of capital and skills to Holland. In order to get an approximate picture for Western Europe as a whole, I made proxy estimates for Austria, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland, assuming that per capita real GDP increased at 0.17 per cent a year for 1500–1820. For Germany, a per capita growth rate of 0.14 per cent was assumed, as there was a decline in Germany’s role in banking and Hanseatic trade, as well as the impact of the 30 years war. When the proxy estimates are aggregated with the estimates for the 5 countries for which we have better evidence, we find average per capita growth for the 12 West European core countries of 0.15 per cent a year. This is significantly slower than Kuznets’ 0.2 per cent hypothesis which I used in Maddison (1995 a). I assume here that average per capita growth in “other” Western Europe (Greece and 13 small countries) was the same as the average for the 12 core countries. Table B–14.

Spain and Portugal 

Yun’s (1994) rough per capita GDP estimates for Castile (about three–quarters of Spain) suggest a per capita growth rate of about 0.22 per cent for 1580–1630, with a decline thereafter, and a level in 1800 slightly below the 1630 peak. He makes spot estimates of output levels in current prices for 6 benchmark years within the period 1580 to 1800 and deflates with a price index for food products. His firmest evidence relates to agricultural output and food consumption, but his indicators for secondary and tertiary activity are weak. He concludes that his “trajectory seems congruent with what we know about the evolution of the Castilian economy: expansion until the end of the sixteenth century; agrarian recession, decomposition of the urban network and industrial and commercial crisis during the seventeenth, with a subsequent fall of the GDP revealed in our numbers; and growth on the basis of the poorly developed urban structures and the greater dynamism of the outlying areas in the eighteenth century”. I assumed a growth rate of Spanish GDP per capita of 0.25 per cent a year for 1500–1600, no advance in the seventeenth century and some mild progress from 1700 to 1820. I adopted a similar profile for Portugal. 

Eastern Europe and USSR 

For these two areas direct evidence was lacking. As a proxy I assumed slower per capita GDP growth than in Western Europe at 0.1 per cent per annum for 1500–1820 (as I did in Maddison, 1995 a). 

Western Offshoots 

For the United States, Gallman (1972) p. 22 estimated per capita growth in net national product of 0.42 per cent a year between 1710 and 1840 (taking the mid–point of the range he suggests for 1710). Adjusting for the faster growth of per capita income in 1820–40 (see Maddison, 1995 a, p. 137), Gallman’s estimate implies a per capita growth of about .29 per cent a year for the non–indigenous population, from a level of $909 in 1700 to $1 286 in 1820. Gallman’s estimate included only the white and black population. In 1820, the indigenous population was only 3 per cent of the total. In 1700, it was three–quarters of the total (see Table B–15). Assuming the indigenous population had a per capita income of $400 in both 1700 and 1820, the average level for the whole population was $527 in 1700 and $1 257 in 1820. For 1500 and 1600, the population consisted entirely of hunter– gatherer Indians, and an average income of $400 a head was assumed. Mancall and Weiss (1999) have recently estimated US per capita income for 1700 and 1800, with separate assessments for whites, slaves and Indians. Their “multicultural” estimate (p. 35) shows a per capita growth rate of only 0.28 per cent a year for 1700–1800, compared with my 0.73 per cent a year for 1700–1820. I consider their growth rate to be much too slow, given the huge change in the ethnic composition of the population in the period. They show no figures for population or total GDP, so it is not possible to replicate their “multicultural” measure. They make no reference to the Gallman estimate I used. For the other Western Offshoots, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the great bulk of the 1500– 1700 population were indigenous hunter–gatherers, and I assumed a per capita GDP of $400 for 1500, 1600, and 1700.

Mexico 

My per capita income estimate for 1820 is $759 (see Appendix A). At that time the indigenous population was about 53 per cent of the total (see Table B–16). There was a thin layer of “peninsular” Spaniards (about 1 per cent of the population) who ran the army, administration, the church, trading monopolies and part of the professions. They had a baroque life style with sumptuous residences and retinues of servants. About a sixth of the population were criollos , i.e. whites of Spanish origin, who had been born in Mexico. They were hacienda owners, merchants, part of the clergy, army and professions. The third social group, over a quarter of the population, were mestizos originating from unions between whites and Indians. They were generally workers, farm hands, servants and some were rancheros. I assume a per capita income of $425 for the native population. The aggregate estimate for 1820 implies an average per capita income of $1 140 for the non–native population. 1500–1700 per capita income level of the two segments of the population was assumed to be the same as in 1820, but the average was lower for the two segments combined, because the non–native population was only a quarter of the total in 1700, 4 per cent in 1600, and negligible in 1500. 

Other Latin America 

In 1500, other parts of Latin America were poorer than Mexico. Except in Peru, most of the inhabitants were hunter gatherers rather than agriculturalists. They also had a lower per capita income than Mexico at the end of the colonial period in 1820. Thus their per capita income grew more slowly than in Mexico from 1500 to 1820. I assumed that the growth differential between Mexico and the rest of Latin America was stable between 1500 and 1820.

China 

Maddison (1998 a) contains an extensive analysis of the course of population, total output, and per capita product over the past 2000 years. There is a greater mass of survey material on Chinese population for the past two millennia than for any other country, thanks to the bureaucratic system and its efforts to monitor economic activity for tax purposes. In assessing the growth of agricultural output, Perkins (1969) is a masterpiece of scholarly endeavour, covering the period 1368–1968, on which I relied heavily. Perkins’ analysis is basically Boserupian. He feels that China responded successfully to population pressure, and managed to sustain more or less stable per capita consumption over the period he covers. This was achieved by increases in cultivated area, in per capita labour input, and land productivity. It involved heavy inputs of traditional fertilisers, irrigation, development of crop varieties and seeds which permitted multiple cropping, diffusion of best–practice techniques by officially sponsored distribution of agricultural handbooks (available at an early stage due to the precocious development of paper and printing). Crops from the Americas were introduced after the mid–sixteenth century. Maize, peanuts, potatoes and sweet potatoes added significantly to China’s output potential because of their heavy yields and the possibility of growing them on inferior land. Tobacco and sugar cane were widely diffused in the Ming period. The pattern of Chinese food consumption was heavily concentrated on proteins and calories supplied by crop production which makes more economic use of land than pastoral activities. Chinese consumption of meat was very much lower than in Europe and concentrated on poultry and pigs which were scavengers rather than grazing animals. Milk and milk products were almost totally absent. Chinese also made very little use of wool. Ordinary clothing came largely from vegetable fibres (hemp, ramie, and then cotton). Quilted clothing supplied the warmth that wool might have provided. The richer part of the population used silk. Silk cocoons were raised on mulberry bushes often grown on hillsides which were not suitable for other crops. Chinese rural households had many labour–intensive activities outside farming. They raised fish in small ponds, used grass and other biomass for fuel. Important “industrial” activities were centred in rural households. Textile spinning and weaving, making garments and leather goods were largely household activities. The same was true of oil and grain milling; drying and preparation of tea leaves; tobacco products; soybean sauce; candles and tung oil; wine and liqueurs; straw, rattan and bamboo products. Manufacture of bricks and tiles, carts and small boats, and construction of rural housing were also significant village activities. Chinese farmers were engaged in a web of commercial activity carried out in rural market areas to which virtually all villages had access. All these non–farm activities appear to have intensified in the Sung dynasty (960–1280). Thereafter some proportionate increase seems plausible because of the growing importance over the long term of cash crops like cotton, sugar, tobacco and tea. In the nineteenth century well over a quarter of GDP came from traditional handicrafts, transport, trade, construction and housing and most of these were carried out in rural areas. It seems likely that their proportionate importance was just as large in 1500 as it was in 1820. On the basis of Rozman’s (1973) rough estimates, it would seem that there were no dramatic changes in the proportion of the urban population (persons living in towns with a population of 10 000 or more) in China between the Tang dynasty and the beginning of the nineteenth century. This is in striking contrast to the situation in Western Europe, and is a significant piece of corroborative evidence of the comparative performance of China and Europe. Another type of evidence which is very useful is the detailed documentation and chronology of Chinese technology in Needham’s magnum opus on Chinese science and civilisation. Although it is weak in analysing the economic impact of invention, it is an invaluable help in assessing comparative development in agriculture, metallurgy, textile production, printing, shipbuilding, navigation etc. and in its assessment of Chinese capacity to develop the fundamentals of science. The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 252 

The big advance in Chinese land productivity, and the more modest advance in living standards came before the period we are examining here. The big shift from wheat and millet farming in North China, to much more intensive wet rice farming south of the Yangtse came in the Sung dynasty (tenth to thirteenth century). The evidence strongly suggests that per capita GDP stagnated for nearly six centuries thereafter although China was able to accommodate a large rise in population through extensive growth. 

India 

Maddison (1971) contained an analysis of the social structure and institutions of the Moghul Empire and of British India. For the Moghul period, I relied heavily on the economic survey of Abul Fazl, Akbar’s vizier, carried out at the end of the sixteenth century (see translation by Jarrett and Sarkar, 1949). I had no firm conclusions on the growth rate from 1500 to 1820, but there was little evidence to suggest that it was a dynamic economy. There is no reason to think that the British takeover had a positive effect on economic growth before the 1850s. 

The Cambridge Economic History of India, Vol.1 (Raychaudhuri and Habib, 1982) does not address the growth question very directly, and deals with India by major area, without trying to generalise for the country as a whole. Habib suggests that farm output per head of population may have been higher in 1595 than in 1870, or 1900, and bases this inference on the availability of more cultivatable land per head at the earlier period and apparently greater relative availability of bullocks and buffaloes as draft animals. On the other hand he also stresses the introduction of new crops in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. He is more upbeat about manufacturing: “The expansion of the domestic and foreign markets, and the rising public expenditure on urban developments, public monuments and the army suggest an upward trend in output and possibly labour productivity.” (p. 305) Shireen Moosvi (1987, p. 400) assumes that rural per capita consumption was about the same in 1601 as in 1901, but that urban income was bigger at the earlier date. She therefore assumes an aggregate per capita consumption level 5 per cent higher at the first date. Moreland (1920, p. 274) using the same sort of evidence as Habib and Moosvi, but with less intensive scrutiny, concluded that India was almost certainly not richer at the death of Akbar than in 1910–14, “and probably that she was a little poorer”. My own judgement is that Indian per capita income fell from 1700 to the 1850s due to the collapse of the Moghul Empire and the costs of adjusting to the British regime of governance (see analysis in Chapter 2). 

Japan 

There are no previous estimates of the long term macroeconomic performance of Japan before the Meiji Restoration of 1868. However, one can get some idea of what happened by comparing Japanese and Chinese experience. In the seventh century, Japan tried to model its economy, society, religion, literature and institutions on those of China. Admiration for things Chinese continued until the eighteenth century, even though Japan was not integrated into the Chinese international order (with two brief exceptions) as a tributary state. However, Japan never created a meritocratic bureaucracy but let the effective governance of the country fall into the hands of a hereditary and substantially decentralized military elite. The institutional history of Japan from the tenth to the fifteenth century therefore had a closer resemblance to that of feudal Europe than to that of China. Japan copied the institutions of Tang China in the seventh century, creating a national capital at Nara, on the model of China’s Chang–an. It also adopted Chinese style Buddhism, and allowed its religious orders to acquire very substantial properties and economic influence. It adopted Chinese Appendix B 253 

ideograms, the kanji script, Chinese literary style, Chinese clothing fashions, the Chinese calendar, methods of measuring age and hours. There was already a substantial similarity in the cropping mix and food consumption, with a prevalence of rice agriculture, and much smaller consumption of meat and meat products than in Europe. There was greater land scarcity in Japan and China than in Europe or India, so the agriculture of both countries was very labour–intensive. Although Japanese emperors continued to be nominal heads of state, governance fell into the hands of a hereditary aristocracy. From 1195 to 1868, the effective head of state was a military overlord known as the shogun .From the seventh to the ninth century, the central government controlled land allocation in imitation of Tang China, but ownership gradually devolved on a rural military elite. The shoen was a complex and fragmented feudal system. Many layers of proprietors claimed a share of the surplus from a servile peasantry. Technological progress and its diffusion were facilitated in China by its bureaucracy to a degree which was not possible in Japan, which had no educated secular elite. Knowledge of printing was available almost as early as in China, but there was little printed matter except for Buddhist tallies and talismans. The Chinese, by comparison, used printed handbooks of best–practice farming to disseminate the methods of multicropping, irrigation and use of quick ripening seeds which the Sung dynasty imported from Vietnam. The degree of urbanisation was smaller in Japan than in China. The division of Japan into particularistic and competing feudal jurisdictions meant that farming and irrigation tended to develop defensively on hillsides. The manorial system also inhibited agricultural specialisation and development of cash crops. Whilst the Chinese had switched from hemp to cotton clothing in the fourteenth century, the change did not come in Japan until the seventeenth. Until the seventeenth century, Japanese production of silk was small, and consumption depended on imports from China. Shipping and mining technology remained inferior to that in China until the seventeenth century. Rural by–employments were slower to develop than in China. The old regime collapsed in Japan after a century of civil war ( sengoku ) which started in 1467. The capital city, Kyoto, was destroyed early in these conflicts, with the population reduced from 400 000 to 40 000 by 1500. A new type of regime emerged from the wreckage, with a new type of military elite. Tokugawa Ieyasu established his shogunal dynasty in 1603, after serving two successive military dictators, Nobunaga (1573–82) and Hideyoshi (1582–98) who had developed some of the techniques of governance which Ieyasu adopted (notably the demilitarisation of rural areas, the kokudaka system of fiscal levies based initially on a cadastral survey, the reduction in ecclesiastical properties, and the practice of keeping daimyo wives and children as hostages). The Tokugawa shogun controlled a quarter of the land area directly. The imperial household and aristocracy in Kyoto had only 0.5 per cent of the fiscal revenue, the Shinto and Buddhist temple authorities shared 1.5 per cent. A third was assigned to smaller daimyo who were under tight control. The rest was allocated to bigger more autonomous ( tozama ) daimyo in rather distant areas who were already feudal lords before the establishment of the Tokugawa regime. These were potential rivals of the shogunate and eventually rebelled in the 1860s. But the shogun in fact held unchallenged hegemonial power after 1615 when he killed Hideyoshi’s family and destroyed his castle in Osaka. The Tokugawa shoguns neutered potential daimyo opposition by keeping their families hostage, and their incomes precarious (between 1601 and 1705, “some 200 daimyo had been destroyed; 172 had been newly created; 200 had received increases in holdings; and 280 had their domains transferred” — Hall, 1991 (pp. 150–1). The shogun’s magistrates directly administered the biggest cities (Edo, Kyoto, Osaka and some others), operated as the emperor’s delegate, controlled foreign relations and the revenue from gold and silver mines. The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 254 

The Tokugawa shogunate was not ideal for economic growth or resource allocation but it exercised a more favourable influence than the Kamakura (1192–1338) and Ashikaga (1338–1573) shogunates which preceded it. It initiated a successful process of catch–up and forging ahead. Between 1600 and 1868 Japanese per capita income probably rose by about 40 per cent, moving from a level below China, to a significantly higher position, in spite of the heavy burden of supporting a large and functionally redundant elite. The Tokugawa established a system of checks and balances between the leading members of the military elite ( daimyo ) who had survived the civil war. It ensured internal peace on a lasting basis. Rural areas were completely demilitarised by Hideyoshi’s 1588 sword hunt and the Tokugawa government’s gradual suppression of the production and use of Western type firearms which the Portuguese had introduced in 1543. The daimyo and their military vassals (the samurai ) were compelled to live in a single castle town in each domain, and abandon their previous managerial role in agriculture. As compensation they received stipends in kind (rice), which was supplied by the peasantry in their domain. Daimyo had no fixed property rights in land and could not buy or sell it. The shogun could move daimyo from one part of the country to another, confiscate, truncate or augment their rice stipends in view of their behaviour (or intentions as determined by shogunal surveillance and espionage). Daimyo were also required to spend part of the year in the new capital Edo (present day Tokyo), and to keep their families there permanently as hostages for good behaviour. Daimyo were not required to remit revenue on a regular basis to the shogunal authority, though they had to meet the very heavy costs of their compulsory (sankin kotai ) residence in Edo and respond to ad hoc demands for funds for constructing Edo and rebuilding it after earthquake damage. This system of goverment was very expensive compared with that of China. The shogunal, daimyo 

and samurai households were about 6.5 per cent of the Japanese population, compared with 2 per cent for the bureaucracy, military and gentry in China. Fiscal levies accounted for 20–25 per cent of Japanese GDP compared with about 5 per cent in China, though the Chinese gentry had rental incomes and the Chinese bureaucracy had a substantial income from non–fiscal exactions. The Tokugawa did, however, achieve some savings by a very substantial reduction in Buddhist income and properties. They also made an ideological shift away from religion towards neo–confucianism. In both respects they were replicating changes which occurred in China in the ninth century. The economic consequences of these political changes were important for all parts of the economy. 

## Growth of Farm Output in the Tokugawa Period 

The farm population were no longer servile households subjected to arbitrary claims to support feudal notables and military. Rice levies were large but more or less fixed and fell proportionately over time as agriculture expanded. The ending of local warfare meant that it was safer to develop agricultural land in open plains. There was greater scope for land reclamation and increases in area under cultivation. This was particularly true in the previously underdeveloped Kanto plain surrounding the new capital Edo. Printed handbooks of best practice agriculture started to appear on Chinese lines. Nogyo Zensho 

(Encyclopaedia of Farming, 1697) was the earliest commercial publication, and by the early eighteenth century there were hundreds of such books (see Robertson, 1984). Quick ripening seeds and double cropping were introduced. There was increased use of commercial fertiliser (soybean meal, seaweed etc.), and improvement in tools for threshing. There was a major expansion of commercial crops — cotton, tobacco, oil seeds, sugar (in South Kyushu and the Ryuku islands), and a very substantial increase in silkworm cultivation. Large scale land reclamation was initiated in the 1720s — partly financed by merchants. Appendix B 255 

Some idea of the progress of agricultural production in Tokugawa Japan can be derived from the 

kokudaka cadastral surveys initiated by Hideyoshi between 1582 and 1590. They assessed the productive capacity of land in terms of koku of rice equivalent (i.e. enough to provide subsistence for one person for a year). The koku as a volumetric measure equivalent to 5.1 US bushels or to 150 kilograms in terms of weight. This kokudaka assessment was the basis on which the shogun allocated income to daimyo .The smallest daimyo were allocated 10 000 koku , the biggest got much larger allocations (over a million 

koku in the Kaga domain at Kanazawa on the Japan Sea coast, 770 000 for the Satsuma domain in Southern Kyushu). In 1598, the total was estimated to be 18.5 million. The official estimate increased over time, as the cultivated area increased, but there were substantial and varying degrees of mismeasurement of the aggregate. Craig (1961, p. 11) gives examples of the difference between nominal and actual productive capacity for the late Tokugawa period; the actual yield for the 9 domains he specifies was one third higher than the official assessment. Nakamura (1968) made an estimate of cereal production for 1600 to 1872 which was adjusted to eliminate these variations in coverage of the official statistics. Table B–17 shows that cereal output per capita increased by 18 per cent from 1600 to 1820, and probably by a quarter over the Tokugawa period as a whole. In 1874, rice and other cereals were 72 per cent of the value of gross farm output, other traditional products 10.7 per cent, and relatively new crops (cotton, sugar, tobacco, oil seeds, silk cocoons and potatoes) 17.2 per cent. Most of the latter were absent in 1600 and most of these escaped taxation, so their production grew faster than cereals. If one assumes that these other items were about 5 per cent of output in 1600, this would imply a growth of total farm output per capita of about a quarter from 1600 to 1820, and over 40 per cent for the Tokugawa period as a whole. For the period before 1600 there is no real quantitative evidence, but it seems likely that there was little growth in agricultural output per head in the sixteenth century which was so severely plagued by civil war.

In 1874, adjusted cereal output represented 72 per cent of the value of gross agricultural output at 1874–6 prices, other traditional crops 10.8 per cent, and other crops 17.2 per cent (see vol. 9, p. 148). The latter group consisted of industrial crops, potatoes and sericulture, most of which were unimportant in 1600. It seems highly likely therefore that per capita farm output rose more rapidly than cereal output. Col. 2, koku (150 kg.) converted into metric tons. Col. 3 is my estimate of population from Table B–7. Col. 4 equals col. 2 divided by col. 3. The standard production measure in Tokugawa Japan was in terms of husked rice, whereas in China the standard unit was unhusked rice. Perkins (1969) assumed a per capita availability of 250 kg. of unhusked rice for China in the period shown here. Using Perkins' (1969, p. 305) coefficient, this meant a per capita availability of 167 kg. of husked rice — higher than Japan in 1600, but lower from 1700 onwards. In 1872, Japan had net imports of rice which raised per capita availability to 219 kg, and in 1874 to 231 kg.

## Performance in the Non–Farm Sector 

Most analysts of the Tokugawa period (Smith, 1969; Hanley and Yamamura, 1977; Yasuba, 1987) stress the growing importance of industrial and commercial by–employments in rural areas. Smith (1969) produced the classic analysis of rural non–farm activity, drawing on a 1843 survey of 15 districts of the Choshu domain. Komonoseki county had a population of 6501 families in a region at the extreme south of Honshu, with a big coastline projecting into the inland sea between Kyushu and Shikoku — an area particularly advantageous for trade with other parts of Japan. 82 per cent of the population were farmers, but 55 per cent of net income originated outside agriculture. The arithmetic average of Smith’s district ratios suggests that industry produced nearly 28 per cent of family income. I am skeptical of the representativity of the Kaminoseki sample. If it were typical of all rural areas, and urban areas had a proportionately greater commitment to non–agriculture, one could expect over 30 per cent of late Tokugawa GDP to have been derived from industry. Nishikawa (1987) presents a much more sophisticated and comprehensive account of the Choshu economy in the 1840s. Using the same survey material he constructed a set of aggregate input–output accounts. His analysis covers 107 000 households (520 000 population) including both rural and urban areas, i.e. a sample 16 times bigger than Smith’s. His approach is in the national accounting tradition with careful consistency checks, merging of different data sources to estimate the labour force, gross output and value added by economic sector. On a value added basis, manufacturing (including handicrafts) accounts for 18.8 per cent of his aggregate. However, he points out that the survey data were seriously deficient for output. His aggregate therefore excludes daimyo–samurai military and civil government services, the activity of monks, nuns, priests and servants, urban services “concentrated in `entertainment’ such as inns, restaurants, teahouses, brothels, streetwalking, hair–dressing, massage and so forth”. There is no imputation for residential accommodation. The construction sector is also omitted. If we augment Nishikawa’s aggregate by a quarter to include the omitted items and bring it to a GDP basis, the structure of value added in Choshu in the 1840s would have been 53 per cent for agriculture, forestry and fisheries, 15 per cent for manufacturing, 32 per cent for the rest (including services and construction). Other very interesting features of the Nishikawa accounts are estimates of Choshu’s transactions with other parts of Japan and demonstration of the physiocratic bias in the Tokugawa fiscal regime. 97 per cent of tax revenue consisted of levies on agriculture, 3 per cent was derived from levies on non agriculture. Apart from his structural analysis, Nishikawa also ventures an estimate of the rate of growth of per capita Choshu income between the 1760s and the 1840s of 0.4 per cent a year. However, this is based entirely on land survey estimates for fiscal purposes. In 1500, less than 3 per cent of Japanese lived in towns of 10 000 population and over. By 1800 more than 12 per cent lived in such cities. Edo which had been a village became a city of a million inhabitants. There were more than two hundred castle towns, half of whose population were samurai . Kanazawa and Nagoya were the biggest with a population over 100 000. The old capital, Kyoto, had half a million (being the seat of the Emperor and his court and the centre of a prosperous agricultural area). Osaka became a large commercial metropolis, similar in size to Kyoto. This four–fold increase in the urban proportion contrasted with a stable and much lower ratio in China. Japan had a smaller proportion of small towns than China, because concentration of samurai in one single castle town per domain was accompanied by compulsory destruction of scattered smaller fortified settlements. There was also a decline in the size of Osaka in the eighteenth century as commercial activity increased in smaller towns and rural areas. The urban centres created a market for the surrounding agricultural areas. They also created a demand for servants, entertainment and theatres. Merchants ceased to be mere quartermasters for the military, and acted as commodity brokers, bankers and money–lenders. They were active in promoting significant expansion of coastal trade and shipping in the inland sea (see Crawcour, 1963). Thus there was clearly a substantial increase in many types of service activity per head of population in Tokugawa Japan. However, the biggest service industry was that of the samurai and daimyo who supplied an exaggeratedly large amount of military and civil governance. The evidence suggests that they remained a Appendix B 257 

stable proportion of the population throughout the Tokugawa epoch. Yamamura’s (1974) study suggests there was not much change in their household real incomes, and Smith’s work on the falling incidence of fiscal levies in agriculture helps to reinforce this latter conclusion. There was a very substantial increase in levels of education in Tokugawa Japan, and an emphasis on secular neo–confucian values rather than Buddhism. This improved the level of popular culture and knowledge of technology. There was a huge increase in book production and circulation of woodblock prints. Between the eighth century and the beginning of the seventeenth fewer than 100 illustrated books appeared in Japan but by the eighteenth there were large editions of books with polychrome illustrations and 40 per cent literacy of the male population. In 1639, the Jesuits and the Portuguese traders were expelled from Japan, Christianity was suppressed and contact with Europeans was restricted to the small Dutch trading settlement in the South of Japan, near Nagasaki. This was done because the Portuguese were intrusive and thought to be a political threat. The Togugawa were aware of the Spanish takeover in the Philippines and wanted to avoid this in Japan. The Dutch were only interested in commerce, but in the course of their long stay in Japan, their East India Company appointed three very distinguished doctors in Deshima (Engelbert Kaempfer, 1690–2, an adventurous German savant and scientist; C.P. Thunberg, 1775–6, a distinguished Swedish botanist; and Franz Philipp von Siebold, 1823–9 and 1859–62, a German physician and naturalist). These scholars wrote books which were important sources of Western knowledge about Japan, but they also had a significant impact in transmitting European science and technology to Japan. The Japanese had depended on Chinese books for knowledge of the West (Chinese translations of works by Matteo Ricci and other Jesuits in Peking), but in 1720 the shogun, Yoshimune, lifted the ban on European books. An important turning point occurred in 1771 when two Japanese doctors observed the dissection of a corpse and compared the body parts (lungs, kidneys and intestines) with those described in a Chinese book and a Dutch anatomy text. The Dutch text corresponded to what they found, and the Chinese text was inaccurate (see Keene, 1969). As a result translations of Dutch learning ( rangaku ) became an important cultural influence. Although they were limited in quantity, they helped destroy Japanese respect for “things Chinese”, and accentuate curiosity about “things Western”. Japanese exposure to Western knowledge was more limited than Chinese, but its impact went much deeper. The old tradition was easier to reject in Japan as it was foreign. However, contacts with foreigners and foreign ideas were often frowned upon by the authorities. Von Siebold was expelled from Japan in 1829, and a Japanese friend was executed for giving him copies of Ino Tadataka’s magnificent survey maps for the Kuriles and Kamchatka. Nevertheless, the Dutch window into the Western world was important and influential in preparing the ground intellectually for the Meiji Restoration of 1868. Dutch learning (painfully acquired) was the major vehicle of enlightenment for Japan’s greatest Westerniser, Yukichi Fukuzawa (1832–1901), whose books sold millions of copies, and who founded Keio University on Western lines. Although the Tokugawa regime had a positive impact on Japanese growth, it had certain drawbacks. It involved the maintenance of a large elite whose effective military potential was very feeble in meeting the challenges which came in the nineteenth century, and whose life style involved extremely lavish expenditure. The Meiji regime was able to capture substantial resources for economic development and military modernisation by dismantling these Tokugawa arrangements. The system of hereditary privilege and big status differentials with virtually no meritocratic element, meant a large waste of potential talent. The frustrations involved are clearly illustrated in Fukuzawa’s autobiography. The Tokugawa system was inefficient in its reliance on a clumsy collection of fiscal revenue in kind and overdetailed surveillance of economic activity. It also imposed restrictions on the diffusion of technology. One example of this was the ban on wheeled vehicles on Japanese roads and the virtual The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 258 

absence of bridges. These restrictions were imposed for security reasons, but made journeys very costly and time consuming. There were also restrictions on the size of boats which inhibited coastal shipping, foreign trade, and naval preparedness. There were restrictions on property rights (buying and selling of land), arbitrary levies by the shogun, cancellation of daimyo debts, or defaults by samurai which inhibited private enterprise. All of these, plus increasing pressures on Japan from Russia, England and the United States, eventually led to the breakdown of the Tokugawa system. 

## Aggregate Japanese Performance 

There has been a good deal of research on the economic history of the Tokugawa period, but hitherto no aggregative quantification of performance except at a regional level. Most of the postwar revisionist historians (Akira Hayami, Yasuba, Nishikawa, Hall, Smith, Hanley and Yamamura) agree (in contrast to earlier Marxists) that there was substantial economic advance. Levels of income were probably depressed in 1500 as a result of civil war but there may have been a modest increase in Japanese per capita income in the sixteenth century. For 1600–1820, there are indicators of substantial increase in performance in several sectors of the economy. For farming as a whole (including new crops — cotton, sugar, tobacco, oil seeds, silk cocoons and potatoes), gross output per head of population rose by about a quarter (see Table B–17 and accompanying text), and value added by somewhat less. In the early Tokugawa period, agriculture probably represented well over half of GDP. There is substantial evidence of an expansion in the importance of rural household activity, and the large increase in the size of the urban population led to an increase in commercial activity and urban services. There were substantial improvements in education, and a large increase in book production. It seems likely that all these activities rose faster than agriculture. An offset to these elements of dynamism was the high cost of the Tokugawa system of governance. The elite of samurai, daimyo and the shogunate absorbed nearly a quarter of GDP. Their official function was to provide administrative and military services. But the way this fossilised elite functioned was extremely wasteful and put inreasing strain on the economy. The apparatus of government was a system of checks and balances — an armed truce whose original rationale had been to end the civil wars which lasted from the mid–fifteenth to the mid–sixteenth century. My overall assessment (see Table B–21) is that from 1500 to 1820 Japanese GDP per capita rose by a third. This was enough to raise its level above that of China and most of the rest of Asia. 

Other Asia 

Other Asia is a miscellaneous conglomerate of countries with about 12.5 per cent of Asia’s population and about 12 per cent of GDP in 1820. For most of them, there is not much hard evidence for assessing their GDP performance from 1500 to 1820. Indonesia is the largest of these countries. The estimates in Tables 2–21c and 2–22 show that most of the modest rise in per capita income from 1700 to 1820 accrued to European and Chinese trading interests. Boomgaard (1993) pp. 208–210 came to a similar conclusion for 1500–1835. He found that the “Dutch and Chinese introduced new technologies, organisational skills and capital, which strengthened the non–agricultural sectors, and led to the introduction of some cash crops (coffee and sugar). However, they also pushed the Javanese out of the more rewarding economic activities and increased the burden of taxation and corvee levies”. Appendix B 259 

Korea was the second biggest of the “other Asia” countries. Until the 1870s, it was a hermit kingdom with only exiguous contact with the outside world except China. Its social organisation and technology were very close to the Chinese model, and there is reason to suppose that its economic performance was similar to that of China, i.e. stagnant per capita income at a level above the Asian norm. The major disturbances to Korean development because of the Mongol and Japanese invasions happened before 1500. The Indochinese states were also Chinese tributaries. They were more open to foreign trade than Korea, but there do not seem to be grounds for supposing that per capita income changed much in the period under consideration. In 1500, the Ottoman Empire had control over a large part of Western Asia and the Balkans. In 1517 it took control of Syria and Egypt and suzerainty of Arabia. The Empire had widespread trading interests in Asia. By the eighteenth century, it had entered a long period of decline, and its trading interests in Asia had been taken over by Europeans. Although estimates of per capita income are not available, there is enough evidence (see Inalcik (1994) and Faroqui et al. , 1994) to suggest that it was lower in 1820 than in 1500. In Iran; the second biggest country in West Asia, it also seems very unlikely that per capita income in 1820 was as high as in the heyday of the Safavid dynasty in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. 

Africa 

I assumed that African per capita income did not change from 1500 to 1700. 

GDP AND GDP P ER C APITA FROM F IRST C ENTURY TO 1000 A.D. 

Before 1500, the element of conjecture in the estimates is very large indeed. The derivation of per capita GDP levels for China and Europe are explained in Maddison (1998 a), and the conjectures for other areas are explained below. In all cases GDP is derived by multiplying the per capita levels by the independently estimated levels of population. Maddison (1998 a) contained estimates of Chinese economic performance from the first century onwards. The evidence suggested that per capita GDP in the first century (in the Han dynasty) was above subsistence levels — about $450 in our numeraire (1990 international dollars), but did not change significantly until the end of the 10th century. During the Sung dynasty (960 — 1280) Chinese per capita income increased significantly, by about a third, and population growth accelerated. The main reason for this advance was a major transformation in agriculture. Until the Sung dynasty, large parts of South China had been relatively underdeveloped. Primitive slash and burn agriculture and moving cultivation had been practiced, but the climate and accessibility of water gave great potential for intensive rice cultivation. The Sung rulers developed this potential by introducing quick ripening strains of rice imported from Indochina. They exploited new opportunities to diffuse knowledge of agricultural technology by printing handbooks of best practice in farming. As a result there was a major switch in the centre of gravity, with a substantial rise in the proportion of people in rice growing south of the Yangtse, and a sharp drop in the proportionate importance of the dry farming area (millet and wheat) of North China. Increased density of settlement in the South gave a boost to internal trade, a rise in the proportion of farm output which was marketed, productivity gains from increased specialisation of agricultural production in response to higher living standards. The introduction of paper money facilitated the growth of commerce, and raised the proportion of state income in cash from negligible proportions to more than half.

For most of the rest of Asia, it seemed reasonable here to assume that the level of per capita income was similar to that in China and showed no great change from the first century to the year 1000. The $450 level of per capita income assumed here is sufficiently above subsistence to maintain the governing elite in some degree of luxury and to sustain a relatively elaborate system of governance. Japan was a rather special case. In the first century, it was a subsistence economy in course of transition to agriculture from hunting and gathering, and from wooden to metal tools. By the year 1000, it had made some progress but lagged well behind China. In Maddison (1998 a), pp. 25, 37–38, it was assumed that European per capita income levels in the first century were similar to those in China. Goldsmith (1984) provided a comprehensive assessment of economic performance for the Roman Empire as a whole, and also provided a temporal link, suggesting that Roman levels were about two fifths of Gregory King’s estimate of English income for 1688. The West Asian and North African parts of the Roman Empire were at least as prosperous and urbanised as the European component, which warrants the assumption of similar levels of income there. Between the first century and the year 1000, there was a collapse in living standards in Western Europe. Urbanisation ratios provide the strongest evidence that the year 1000 was a nadir. The urban ratio of Roman Europe was around 5 per cent in the first century. This compares with zero in the year 1000, when there were only 4 towns with more than 10 000 population (see Maddison, 1998 a, p. 35). The urban collapse and other signs of decline warrant the assumption of a relapse more or less to subsistence levels ($400 per capita) in the year 1000. For the Americas, Australasia, Africa south of the Sahara, Eastern Europe and the area of the former USSR, I have assumed that more or less subsistence levels of income ($400 per capita) prevailed from the first century to the end of the first millennium.

# Annual Estimates of Population, GDP and GDP Per Capita for 124 Countries, 7 Regions and the World, 1950–98 

This appendix contains annual estimates of population; and levels of GDP and GDP per capita in 1990 international dollars for 1950–98. Annual estimates are given for 124 individual countries, as well as regional, subregional, and world totals. The sources are given in Appendix A. Annual estimates for population and GDP movement in earlier years can be found in Maddison (1995 a) for 46 countries. They have not been included here for lack of space. See Maddison (1995 a), Appendix A (pp. 104–107) for annual estimates of population for 12 West European Countries, Western Offshoots and Japan for 1870–1949; pp. 108–109 for five South European Countries, 1900–49; pp. 110– 111 for seven East European Countries 1920–89; pp. 112–113 for seven Latin American Countries 1900–49; pp. 114–115 for ten Asian Countries 1900–49. Annual real GDP indices for the same countries and same years are shown (as far as they are available) on pages 148–159 in Appendix B. These GDP indices are generally compatible with the present estimates for 1950 onwards and can be used to backcast the 1950 levels shown here in Tables C–1b, C–2b and C–3b. Revised annual estimates for 1900–50 for India are shown in Table A–h, and for Japan 1870–1950 in Table A–j of the present work.

Source: First column from A PPP Comparison for the NIS, 1994, 1995 and 1996 , OECD, Paris, February 2000, Annex B, Table B–1. Column 2 is the ratio of 1990 GDP to that of 1996 (derived from Table D–3 above). Third column is column 1 multiplied by column 2. Fourth column is column 3 multiplied by US GDP deflator 1990–96 (0.863082). Last column shows my estimates (from Table A1–b of Appendix A). My figures are based on the ECE estimates for the former USSR (as shown in Table A1–h of Appendix A). The breakdown by republic for 1990 is from Bolotin (1992). Bolotin also used the ICP approach. I prefer my estimates because they are consistent with those I used for East European countries, because the Geary–Khamis approach is distinctly superior to the EKS approach, and because the quality of the data was probably better in the 1990 comparison than in 1996.

Source: 1870–1973 from Maddison (1995 a), updated from OECD, Labour Force Statistics 1978–1998, Paris 1999 for West European countries, Japan and Western Offshoots. In the case of Germany, the 1870–1913 figures refer to the 1913 boundaries (excluding Alsace–Lorraine) and for 1950–98 to 1991 boundaries; for 1950–98, the figures for East Germany (given in the table) were added to those for the Federal Republic. For 1870, and 1913 employment in the territory of the Federal Republic, as given in Maddison (1995 a) was adjusted upwards by the ratio of population within the 1913 frontiers including Alsace–Lorraine to population in the territory of the Federal Republic (see Table A–d in Appendix A). For the United Kingdom, the 1870 and 1913 figures include Southern Ireland; the employment estimates in Maddison (1995 a) for 1870 and 1913 were adjusted upwards by the population ratio. For the other countries in this group the figures refer throughout to employment within present frontiers. For Eastern Europe; 1870–1973 from Maddison (1995 a). East Germany 1950 and 1973 derived from Merkel and Wahl (1991) p. 73; 1990 and 1998 from Van Ark (1999).

Source: Tables F–2, F–3, and B–18. See Maddison (1997), Table 13 for a comparison of ratios at current and constant prices. As export prices have risen less over the long run than GDP deflators, the ratios for earlier years are higher in current than in 1990 prices, e.g. the UK ratio in current prices for 1870 was 17.3; for 1913, 20.9; for 1950, 14.4 and for 1973, 16.3.

# Foreword 

This book is intended as a quantitative reference work and guide to current and past research in macroeconomic history. It is a companion volume to The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective ,published by OECD in 2001. The major purpose of that study was to provide an analytic survey of developments in the world economy over two millennia, and to explore the reasons for the great divergence in the momentum of advance in different regions. The analysis was underpinned by a comprehensive quantification of levels and movement in population, output, and per capita income. The statistical appendices provided annual estimates for 1950–1998, and for 8 benchmark years back to the first century. Annual estimates for 1870–1950 appeared in my earlier book Monitoring the World Economy 1820–1992. 

The present work revises and updates the population estimates for 1950–2003, GDP and per capita GDP estimates for 1820–2001. It shows annual figures back to 1820 wherever possible and provides fuller source notes and explanations of proxy procedures for filling data gaps. For the period before 1820, there are fewer revisions, but detail is given for more countries and there is closer scrutiny of the contours of development in Latin America and Africa. Estimates of benchmark levels of output in 1990 international dollars are unchanged except for seven African countries. The possibilities for extended annual coverage of population, GDP and per capita GDP were greatest for Europe and Western Offshoots. There were about 4 200 annual entries for individual countries in the 2001 volume and 15 200 here. For Latin America, Asia and Africa combined, there were about 15 300 entries in the earlier volume and 22 600 here. The prologue provides a brief survey of the development of historical national accounts and demography from the 17th century to the present. It is based on some of the material I presented in the Kuznets lectures at Yale University in 1998. Sections HS–1 to HS–6 explain the sources and procedures used to derive the basic estimates for countries in the major regions. Section HS–7 summarises the procedures and problems involved in deriving the world totals for 1950–2003. HS–8 does the same for the estimates from the first century to 1950. Research on quantitative economic history has made great strides in the past quarter century, and the efforts of individual scholars have been reinforced by the creation of international networks as explained in HS–8. As a result we have a clearer notion of the range of growth experience, processes of catch–up, convergence and divergence, and underlying causal forces. Research has concentrated on the past two centuries of accelerated growth. Much less has been done on earlier centuries. As a consequence, there are conflicting views on relative levels of income in Europe and Asia around 1800. In my view, it is possible to resolve some of these differences by extending quantitative research further into the past. There were two reasons for indifference to or neglect of distant horizons. One is that quantitative evidence is scarcer the further back one goes in time, and earlier centuries were regarded as impenetrable to quantitative analysis. Another is that economic growth was much slower before the nineteenth century and therefore seemed irrelevant or uninteresting. There was a belief that the roots of modern growth lay in a sudden take–off (an industrial revolution) in the late eighteenth century, that agriculture originated eight thousand years ago and that there was a Malthusian torpor for most of the intervening interval. I disagree with this interpretation for reasons explained in HS–8. The World Economy: Historical Statistics ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 386

# Preface 

This is the eighth study by Angus Maddison published by the Development Centre since 1965. It is a companion volume to The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective, which appeared in 2001. This earlier work had an excellent reception from historians, economists and a broader public and has been a best–seller. This book updates and supplements his earlier panoramic survey of the dynamics of growth, patterns of inequality and their deep–rooted causes. It provides fuller source notes and much more detailed estimates of population, GDP and per capita income. His rigorous handling of the data, systematic comparison and assessment of the reliability of sources and his suggestions about how gaps in the data should be filled are exemplary. There is a closer scrutiny of the contours of African development over the past two millennia; and of Latin American experience since Columbus. It provides a critical review of the literature on macroeconomic measurement from its seventeenth century origins to the present, and is intended as a research guide for future comparisons of economic performance in space and time. A comparative quantitative approach to the world’s regions over a very long period is useful for policy formulation for several reasons. For developing countries, it augments the statistical information on which to base policy decisions in face of uncertainty. For OECD countries, it is a reminder of the key role of long–term processes such as demographic change, technological change and the operation of market forces in determining economic outcomes. It also provides an insightful account of the forces of convergence or divergence across economies and regions and is a valuable contribution to the complex debate about the benefits and costs of globalisation.

# Prologue: The Pioneers of Macromeasurement 

National accounts are an indispensable tool for assessing the growth potential and performance of contemporary economies. They are fundamental in international comparison of development levels. They have become an important tool of analysis for quantitative economic historians. They are sometimes considered too “modern” to be applicable to the distant past. In fact, national accounting, international income comparisons, and historical demography originated in the seventeenth century, when “the art of reasoning by figures on things relating to government” was called Political Arithmetick. 

The 17th Century Pioneers 

The pioneer was William Petty (1623–87), a major figure in the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century. He was research assistant to the philosopher Thomas Hobbes in Paris in the 1640s, Professor of Anatomy in Oxford and organiser of the cadastral survey of Ireland after the Cromwellian conquest in the 1650s, one of the founders of the Royal Society in the 1660s, inventor, cartographer, economist, entrepreneur and founder of a wealthy dynasty. Verbum Sapienti (1665) presented his estimates of population, income, expenditure, stock of land, other physical assets and human capital in an integrated set of accounts for England and Wales. They were intended to provide a quantitative framework for effective implementation of fiscal policy and mobilisation of resources in time of war (the second Anglo–Dutch war of 1664–7). 

Political Arithmetick (1676) was a comparative study of the economic performance of the Netherlands and France, using key indicators to demonstrate Dutch superiority. The French population was ten times the Dutch, but the Dutch merchant fleet was nine times as big, its foreign trade four times as big, its interest rate half the French level, its foreign assets large, those of France negligible. The Dutch economy was highly specialised, importing a large part of its food, hiring mercenaries to fight its wars, concentrating its labour force in high productivity sectors. High density of urban settlement, good ports and internal waterways reduced transport and infrastructure costs, cheapened government services and reduced the need for inventories. Property rights were clear and transfers facilitated by maintenance of registers. An efficient legal system and sound banking favoured economic enterprise. Taxes were high but levied on expenditure rather than income. This encouraged savings, frugality and hard work. The Dutch were a model of economic efficiency with obvious lessons for English policy, whereas popular notions of French power were greatly exaggerated. Both these works were circulated in manuscript in Petty’s lifetime, and published posthumously, in 1690 and 1691. Their publication sparked renewed interest in political arithmetic. The second major contribution came from Gregory King (1648–1712), in reaction to Charles Davenant’s (1694), Essay upon Ways and Means of Supplying the War (war of the League of Augsburg, 1688–97). Davenant (1656–1714) had literary talent as a clear expositor of economic issues (his father was poet laureate, and he was reputed by some to be the grandson of William Shakespeare). As former commissioner of excise when tax collection was taken out of the hands of tax farmers, he was able to present a first consolidated and transparent picture of the government’s actual and potential revenues The World Economy: Historical Statistics 394 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 

and expenditure. King was impressed by the possibilities of using fiscal information for macroeconomic analysis. He established a close relationship with Davenant who quoted his work in detail and called him “that wonderful genius and master in the art of computing”. Publications on sensitive matters of public policy required an official license, and exposed the author to sanctions of official disapproval. King preferred to avoid this risk, circulated copies of his manuscript accounts for comment to Davenant, 

Robert Harley (1661–1724) and others, but did not publish them. Unlike Davenant who was a well connected member of parliament, King was a cautious public servant in course of moving from the antiquated world of heraldry to more lucrative employment as Commissioner of Public Accounts. Harley was later Chancellor of the Exchequer and effectively Prime Minister under Queen Anne. King’s work in this field was intense from 1695 to 1700. His Natural and Political Observations and Conclusions on the State and Condition of England (1696) presented his results in highly concentrated form, but his 300 page Notebook (published in facsimile form by Laslett, 1973) provides an understanding of his meticulous procedures and the sophistication of his analysis. King’s Observations was first published in complete form by George Chalmers in 1802 as an annex to his book on the Comparative Strength of Great Britain . This sparked the interest of Patrick Colquhoun (1745–1820) who exploited new sources of information (the first two censuses and the first income tax accounts) to replicate King’s income account, and provide a more comprehensive production account showing value added for 1812. However, King’s 

Notebook did not surface until 1917, and was first explored by David Glass in 1965. It is a treasure trove which deserves to be mined more thoroughly by quantitative historians. The modern standardised system of national accounts provides a coherent macroeconomic framework covering the whole economy, which can be crosschecked in three ways. From the income side, it is the total of wages, rents and profits. It is also the sum of final expenditures by consumers, investors and government. From the production side, it is the sum of value added in different sectors– agriculture, industry and services, net of duplication. The framework can be expanded to include measures of labour input and capital stock, labour and total factor productivity. King had four dimensions to his accounts which anticipated this modern system of interrelated balances: 

a) the best–known is his depiction of the 1688 social hierarchy, showing 26 types of household, their number, average size, income and expenditure, savings or dependency on social transfers, and type of economic activity. In constructing it, King drew on 30 years experience in the Herald’s office, making visitations to various parts of England to examine credentials of succession to aristocratic titles, the status and social standing of people who accounted for about two–thirds of national income. As a commissioner for the graduated poll tax on births, deaths, and marriage which came into force in 1695, he had access to a great deal of new information on the structure of incomes. The hearth tax was a further guide to the number of households and their average size; 

b) his second account showed government spending and consumer expenditure by type of product, based on information derived from land and excise taxes for food, drink and tobacco, and a special survey he made for clothing and textiles. In Observations this account is very summary, but it is clear from the Notebook that his aggregate was the fruit of detailed estimation, and contains enough information to provide an approximation to the modern notion of gross domestic product (see Table 1 where I augment his aggregate which had narrower boundaries than is now standard); 

c) his production account was incomplete. It showed value added in farming (crops and livestock) and forestry. His Notebook provides detailed quantification of many other items–textiles, value added in the paper industry, a breakdown of material inputs and labour costs in construction and shipbuilding. It shows expenditure on furniture, ceramics, pottery, glass, tools and transport equipment which can be converted into production estimates, with adjustment to deduct material inputs, transport and distributive margins; 395 Prologue 

d) a fourth dimension was his consolidated wealth and income account for 1688, showing property and labour income, the capitalised value of physical assets and of human capital. This resembled Petty’s account for 1665, though the techniques of capitalisation were different. King had a fifth account which compared levels of per capita consumption, public expenditure and revenue in England, France and Holland in 1688 and in 1695 in order to demonstrate differences in capacity to mobilise resources for war. It also contained a forecast of English national income to 1698. The estimates for France and the Netherlands were in most respects very rough, and he did not discuss the problem of measuring changes in the volume of output over time or adjusting for differences in the purchasing power of currency in making international comparisons.

Box 1. Political arithmeticians were also pioneers of demography 

The first serious demographer was John Graunt (1620–74), a close friend of Petty. Graunt’s Observations on the Bills of Mortality published in 1662 involved a meticulous assemblage and adjustment of a very large weekly and annual database on burials and christenings in London for 1603 onwards. For 20 years he had data on causes of death, broken down by 81 categories. He had access to returns of a partial census for 1631 which provided a benchmark for his growth estimates. Graunt distinguished the regular pattern of chronic ailments from epidemics. Plague was endemic but recurred at irregular intervals. The worst year was 1603, when it caused 82 per cent of deaths. He had no direct information on age at death, but constructed a rough proxy by grouping illnesses which affected infants and children, and those associated with old age. He constructed a crude survival table which showed 36 per cent mortality for those aged 0–6, with only 3 per cent surviving beyond age 66. This was the ancestor of life tables, and attracted wide interest in England, France and Holland where life annuities and tontines (a lottery on life expectation invented by Lorenzo Tonti in 1652) were part of the public debt. 

Edmond Halley (1656–1742) improved on Graunt’s crude analysis of life expectation and articulated the fundamental mathematical principles of life insurance in (1693) “Degrees of Mortality of Mankind; with an Attempt to ascertain the Price of Annuities”, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. 

In confronting data on London burials and christenings, Graunt found that burials were bigger. By comparison of the average discrepancy between births and deaths, he concluded that there was net immigration from small towns and rural areas of about 6 000 persons a year. As a crosscheck, he analysed annual data for Romsey, a town near Southampton. Over 90 years there was a net increase of 1 059 persons, of which 300 remained in Romsey, 400 emigrated to the Americas and 300–400 emigrated to London. In the third edition, in 1665, Graunt extended the analysis of country towns to Tiverton in Devon and Cranbrook in Kent, which confirmed the Romsey/London differentials. As births were rising substantially over time, it was clear that the population was growing, and the growth of the housing stock corroborated this. Using inferences about age structure and likely fertility in conjunction with his other material, he suggested that London had grown two and a half fold in the previous 56 years. Graunt concluded that the population of England and Wales was 14 times as big as that of London. His multiplier was derived from several indicators, i.e. London’s share of the tax burden; cartographic analysis of the area of different parts of the country, likely density of settlement, the average size of parishes. Prior to Graunt, nobody had thought of using the mortality bills to reconstruct the demography of London. His meticulous inspection of data, adjustments for coverage, the caution and modesty with which he explained his carefully structured inferences and techniques of analysis are the foundation of modern historical demography, and he clearly belonged to the pantheon of seventeenth century science. Gregory King made a significant improvement on Graunt’s estimate of the population of England and Wales. He had much more information for areas outside London. He had the hearth tax returns on the number of houses (1 million rural and 300 000 urban). From Davenant (1694) he had evidence from the chimney tax on house occupancy. He organised mini–censuses for Lichfield, Harfield and Buckfastleigh as a crosscheck on household size. His estimate of family size was smaller than Graunt’s. He found an average household of 4.23 persons, but this included domestic servants, apprentices and unmarried farm labourers who lived in. Deducting these the average family size was 3.8 persons. King’s estimate of the population of England and Wales in 1695 was 5.5 million, significantly lower than Graunt’s 6.4 million, but virtually identical with the estimate of Wrigley et al. (1997) in their detailed reconstitution of English demographic history 1580–1837 using the sophisticated techniques and massive computing power of modern demography. King also made an estimate of world population in 1695, based on a calculation of the surface area of the globe, the proportion of land in the total and the likely density of settlement on different types of land. His world total in the Notebook was 626 million, much closer to my 604 million for 1700 than Petty’s estimate of 320 million in his day or Riccioli’s (1672) estimate of 1 billion.

Between 1695 and 1707, there was interest in national income estimation in France. In 1695 

Pierre de Boisguilbert (1646–1714), lieutenant–general (chief judge and president of the appeals court) in Rouen (capital of the province of Normandy), published anonymously La France ruinée sous la règne de Louis XIV, a very pessimistic assessment of the economic condition of France, the need to make its fiscal structure more effective and equitable and to be less dirigiste in economic policy. In 1697 another version appeared, still anonymous but with a less provocative title Le détail de la France .Boisguilbert was impressed by the hunger crises and population decline which hit France in the early 1690s. He asserted that the national income had fallen by a third since 1660, but in fact provided no detail. Boisguilbert’s books attracted little notice but stimulated the interest of Sebastien le Prestre de Vauban (1633–1707), a military engineer, who designed and supervised the construction of fortifications on the Northern and Eastern frontiers, successfully besieged many enemy cities, and constructed ports and forts on the Atlantic coast. Marshal Vauban had experience in galvanising regional and local authorities and mobilising resources for construction projects in many parts of France over a period of decades, so it is not surprising that he developed aspirations as a social engineer at the end of his career. There is a striking difference in tone between the work of Boisguilbert and Vauban and the English school of political arithmetic. The French writers were both convinced that the economy of their country was in a parlous state and the English were much more upbeat about England. In 1707 Vauban published La dîme royale, a detailed proposal to transform the tax structure, which included a detailed assessment of potential revenue under a new tax regime. He was encouraged in this endeavour by the success of a proposal he made to the king in January 1695 for a temporary wartime capitation tax. This was adopted in 1695 and terminated in 1697 when the war ended. It was similar to the English poll tax of 1695–1705. Its incidence was graduated by descending order in the social hierarchy for 22 classes of taxpayer from the Dauphin down; social position being a proxy for income assessment. It was reintroduced in 1701 as a regional supplement to the taille without the key feature of graduation by ability to pay (see Collins, 2001, pp. 133–4 and 165–7). The French revenue system Boiguilbert and Vauban wanted to transform was highly inefficient and inequitable. The main direct tax, the taille , involved large exemptions for the nobility and office holders. Some of these were for individuals ( personnelle ), others exempted specified properties ( réelle ). Tax rates varied regionally, between the pays d’élection and the pays d’état (Brittany, Burgundy, Languedoc and Provence, where tax rates were largely determined by the regional authorities). There were internal transit duties ( traites ) on merchandise crossing regional frontiers, inhibiting the development of a national market. Collection of direct and indirect taxes was done mainly by tax farmers and traitants , who made advance payments to the authorities and kept what they could collect. At the bottom level, in the 36 000 parishes, tax liability was fixed collectively. A large proportion of public officials obtained their posts by purchase, or inherited them from relatives. Most of them paid an annual fee ( paulette ) to guarantee inheritability of their office. In fact their salaries ( gages ) were equivalent to interest on the money they paid for their post. As a result the bureaucracy was swollen by officials who were only partially employed. The major indirect tax ( gabelle ), was on salt; the rate of tax varied between regions, virtually zero in producing regions like Brittany, and high in Burgundy, where wine taxes were low. As a consequence, there was large–scale smuggling and expenditure on revenue police. In all these respects, England had a more efficient, transparent and equitable fiscal system. In 1694 it acquired a central bank and established effective foundations for a market in long–term government debt. In France the first attempt a national budget was Necker’s Compte Rendu au Roi in 1781, and the Banque de France was not created until 1800. Vauban proposed to abolish all the existing taxes on property, income and internal transit, and replace them with a single tax on income without exemptions or regional variation. He proposed to simplify the rate structure of the salt tax to reduce smuggling. He suggested new indirect taxes on luxuries and on liquor consumed in bars ( cabarets ). 399 Prologue 

In order to assess potential revenue from his new system he made estimates of national income, population and area. For area, he used a rough average of five different cartographic sources for 38 regions of France. His estimated total was the equivalent of 60 million hectares. This was an exaggeration. The present area is 55 million and at that time (before Lorraine and Savoie were incorporated) was about 50 million (see Le Roy Ladurie, 1992, p. 280). In fact, King’s estimate of the area of France (51 million hectares) was much more exact. For population Vauban used estimates from 28 provincial officials for years between 1694–1700. His total was 19.1 million, which tallies fairly well with modern estimates for the area he covered (see Bardet and Dupaquier, 1997, p. 449). King’s estimate for France (14 million) was much too low. Vauban’s estimates of national income were rough and hybrid. His measure for agriculture referred to gross output, with no deduction for feed, seed and upkeep of buildings and equipment. He did not distinguish between different categories of agricultural income, and did not cover non–agricultural activity in rural areas. He specified 10 types of non–agricultural income from property and labour. The sophistication of the analysis was greatly inferior to that of Gregory King, and he was dealing with a country where fiscal and other evidence for a coherent national analysis was much more exiguous than in England. Vauban estimated agricultural output on the basis of a sample study of Normandy. For this he had help from an anonymous friend (possibly Boisguilbert). He assumed that 80 per cent of the land yielded income from crops, livestock, vineyards and forestry, with a third of cropland in fallow. He estimated the physical crop yield for wheat and its value per square league (20 square km.). He assumed this value yield per league was also valid for pastoral activities, vineyards and forestry. From this he estimated a tax yield about 24 per cent higher than the ecclesiastical tithe for Normandy. Nevertheless, he took the latter as representative and blew up it up by the ratio of the land area of France to that of Normandy. After a further conservative reduction of about 10 per cent, he concluded that the tax yield at the national level would be 60 million livres, assuming a 5 per cent levy ( vingtième ) on gross output. If we multiply his 5 per cent tax yield by 20, gross agricultural output for France would have been 1 200 million livres; his first estimate implied 1667 million livres. However, if we deduct inputs into agriculture, adjust for his overstatement of the area of France and the fact that Normandy was more densely populated than the country as a whole, it seems likely that he was overstating national income from agriculture substantially. Vauban’s estimate of non–rural income was 352 million livres. Rent and imputed rent (net of repair and maintenance) from 320 000 urban houses he estimated to be 32 million. Interest on government debt 20 million, mixed income from commerce, banking, fishing, shipping, and grain milling 58 million, pensions and emoluments of government officials 40 million, legal income 10 million. He assumed there were 1.5 million servants with emoluments of 30 million. 2 million non–agricultural labourers and artisans were assumed to earn 162 million–he derived this from their average daily wage, and assumed a working year of 185 days (deducting 52 Sundays, 38 days for public holidays, 50 for intemperate weather, 20 days attending fairs and markets, and 25 for illness). Except for the last three groups, he gave no indication of the number of people involved in rural and non–rural activity. He proposed the introduction of a Chinese–style household registration system to remedy this defect, and appended a form showing the type of detail by age, sex and occupation which should be garnered annually by local worthies. Vauban must have realised that his assessment of non–rural income was inadequate, as he started his analysis by asserting that it was bigger than rural income. However, he could have crosschecked his estimates more closely for consistency. His estimate of the number of non–rural houses (320 000) is manifestly too low for a non–rural labour force of more than 3.5 million and their families.

Vauban insisted that the costs of collection would be greatly reduced with his system and that the transition from the existing order would be painless. He felt that one could dispense with the sevices of tax farmers and traitants whom he classified as bloodsuckers ( Sang-suës d’État) . He felt that there could be a smooth tansition to collection of agricultural levies in kind to be stored in government warehouses. He did not explain how the government would dispose of these commodities. He was also insouciant about the protests of the elite who would lose their tax–exempt status. In chapter VIII he identified all the groups who might oppose his proposition and suggested that with 200 000 armed men at his disposal the king could easily quell any opposition. Politically his proposition was both naïve and provocative. In February 1707, a month before Vauban’s death, the book was officially condemned and the remaining copies were destroyed. 

The 18th Century Onwards 

From the beginning of the eighteenth century to the 1940s, there were about thirty attempts to measure national income in Britain. There were significant differences in their coverage and methodology. Most concentrated on the income dimension without crosschecks from the expenditure or production side. Most were spot estimates for a given point of time and it was difficult to link them to measure economic growth, as there was only a limited and belated effort to develop appropriate price deflators (see Colin Clark, 1937). Nevertheless, these estimates are still very useful to quantitative economic historians. Thanks to detailed scrutiny by Phyllis Deane (1955–7) they provided a starting point and inspiration for pioneering studies of British economic growth by Deane and Cole (1964), Feinstein (1972), Matthews, Feinstein and Odling–Smee (1982) and Crafts (1985). The retrospective estimates of this new generation of quantitative historians are generally based on the modern international standardised system of national accounts. Studenski (1958) cites nine attempts to measure French national income later in the 18th century. Some of these were an improvement on Vauban, notably Lavoisier’s De la richesse territoriale du royaume de France (1791), and Arthur Young’s (1794, chapter 15) detailed estimates of French agricultural output for 1787–9. Young found that land productivity in Normandy was much higher than in the rest of France, which strengthens the impression that Vauban overstated agricultural output. Between 1800 and the first world war, the statistical basis for macroeconomic measurement improved a good deal in Europe, North America and the Antipodes. Population censuses provided a much better basis for demographic analysis. Statistical offices collected data on trade, transport, fiscal and monetary matters, employment, wages and prices. There was an increasing array of information on commodity output in agriculture, mining and manufacturing. Index number techniques were developed which would have made it possible to measure temporal change and inter–spatial variance of complex aggregates. Although there was a proliferation of national income estimates, there was little improvement in their quality or comparability. They provided little help for serious analysis of economic growth, and there were significant differences in their coverage and methodology. 

Michael Mulhall (1836–1900) made a serious contribution to international comparison of levels of performance. Mulhall was Irish, educated in Rome, and spent his early working life as a journalist in Argentina. He published four major books between 1880 and 1896, drawing on census, trade, and commercial information to demonstrate developments in the world economy. His Industry and Wealth of Nations 

(1896) was devoted entirely to providing consistent comparisons of national output and wealth. He gave detailed sources and a mass of carefully structured statistical material in comparative form for 22 countries representing about 60 per cent of world product in 1894–5. He referred to other national income estimates where available, but used his own standard rules of thumb to assess value added for all countries. He also provided standard guidelines for his measures of national wealth. His methods 401 Prologue 

were simple and described transparently. To determine total value added, he divided each national economy into 9 sectors, estimated gross output in each sector, and to avoid double counting, deducted inputs as specified below. His coverage of Europe and Western offshoots was pretty comprehensive, but for the rest of the world was confined to Argentina and South Africa. He provided current price estimates of the level in income in eight countries at dates ranging from 1812 to 1895. His cross–country comparison for 1894 was at current prices (in £ sterling) using exchange rates. Mulhall had a powerful influence on Timothy Coghlan, the government statistician for New South Wales who made the first official estimates of national income for the Seven Colonies of Australasia 

which were published regularly from 1886–1905. 

Colin Clark (1905–89) took a major step towards world accounts in his Conditions of Economic Progress in 1940. He assembled income estimates for 30 countries (pp. 40–1). He adjusted them to mitigate national idiosyncrasies of measurement and made rough proxies for another 20 countries (based on indicators of real wages) to make a rough estimate of world income for 1925–34 (p. 56). He constructed a crude PPP measure to make the individual country estimates additive in terms of his “international unit” (US dollars with average purchasing power of 1925–34). Unlike Mulhall, who made his own multicountry estimates on a standardised basis, Clark was in large degree a compiler of other people’s estimates, seeking maximalist coverage. To measure economic growth, he made time series comparisons in real terms for 15 countries for disparate years between 1850 and the 1930s (pp. 146–148), but in many cases these were weak because he was willing to make crude links between different and not always comparable “spot” estimates, and to make use of some dubious deflators. All of Clark’s 1940 estimates have now been superseded, but his work is still of substantial historical interest, because he made an exhaustive survey of the work of virtually all the economists and statisticians who had published in his field in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and had extensive correspondance with the statisticians of his day who were engaged in such work. He never hesitated to adjust these estimates to conform to his own ideas about the appropriate coverage of the accounts or methods of treatment of particular items. He also used the estimates analytically. Systematic comparative confrontation is a particularly good way of testing the plausibility and consistency of estimates and may well induce careful scrutiny of “outlier countries”. In 1940, however, there was no agreement on the coverage and methodology of national accounts, and the comparability of the different estimates was therefore restricted. Table 3.

## The Modern Era 

The first official estimates for the United States were made by Simon Kuznets (1901–85) in 1934, at a time when the economy was in deep depression. The accounts were felt to be an important tool for improving public policy. In the United Kingdom, the outbreak of war in 1939 led to a replication of the Davenant–King partnership of the 1690s. In February 1940, Maynard Keynes published How to Pay for the War: A Radical Plan for the Chancellor of the Exchequer . The structure of his argument was butressed by national accounts developed by Colin Clark (they were already closely associated in 1931–7, when Keynes was analysing the causes and cure for unemployment). Keynes persuaded the chancellor to include a first official set of accounts in his 1941 budget. The accounts were an important tool in Whitehall strategy for winning the war. The integrated statistical perspective led to much more effective resource mobilisatiton than in Germany (see Kaldor, 1946). In 1944 there were consultations between British, Canadian and US statisticians with a view to standardisation of their concepts and procedures (see Denison, 1947). In the postwar years, comparable accounts were felt to be a political necessity to facilitate assessment of needs for Marshall Aid and burden–sharing in NATO. The standardised system was designed in large part by Richard Stone (1913–1991), who together with James Meade made the first official estimates of national income for the United Kingdom in 1941. He also produced guidelines for OEEC and OECD on Quantity and Price Indexes (1956), 

Input–Output and National Accounts (1961) and Demographic Accounting and Model Building 

(1971). His magnum opus was his posthumously published (1997) Some British Empiricists in the Social Sciences, 1650-1900 . Stone and Milton Gilbert (chief of US national income accounts until 1951 and Director of the OEEC Economics and Statistics Department until 1960) were very active in the 1950s in seeing that the 1952 standardised system was implemented in OEEC countries. Shortly after, the OEEC system was merged with that of the UN which was applied by official statisticians in most countries in the postwar years, except in communist countries whose accounts excluded many service activities, and involved some duplication. Milton Gilbert (1909–79) and Irving Kravis (1916– 92) pioneered the first official measures of the purchasing power parity of currencies, published by OEEC in 1954. Kravis greatly expanded the scope of the PPP measures by starting the International Comparison Project (ICP) in 1968, and in 1978, together with his colleagues Robert Summers and Alan Heston inaugurated the Penn World Tables (PWT) to fill gaps in ICP coverage. Thanks to these pioneering efforts, there are now official estimates of GDP growth for years since 1950 for 179 countries, and purchasing power parity measures which permit comparison of levels of performance. They have become a major instrument of economic policy in virtually all countries. Western Europe, 1500–2001 403

I also comment on new estimates for Austria and Greece which I have not adopted. 1950 onwards from Appendix C of Maddison (2001), The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective, updated as follows: GDP volume movement 1995–2001 from OECD, National Accounts of OECD Countries, 1989–2000 ,vol. 1, and OECD, Quarterly National Accounts Statistics , 2/2002; Maddison (2001), pp.171–4 and 189– 90 explain the derivation of the benchmark 1990 GDP levels. Except for Germany and the United Kingdom, the estimates are adjusted to eliminate the impact of frontier change.

Kausel, “Österreichs Volkseinkommen 1830 bis 1913“ in Geschichte und Ergebnisse der zentralen amtlichen Statistik in Österreich 1829–1979, Beitrage zur österreichischen Statistik ,Heft 550, Vienna, 1979, pp. 692–3. 1820–30 per capita movement assumed to be the same as that for 1830–40 (see Kausel, p. 701). 1913–50 gross national product in 1937 prices by expenditure and industry of origin, from A. Kausel, N. Nemeth, and H. Seidel, “Österreichs Volkseinkommen, 1913– 63“, Monatsberichte des Österreichischen Institutes für Wirtschaftsforschung , 14th Sonderheft, Vienna, August 1965, p. 38 and 42; 1937–45 from F. Butschek, Die Österreichische Wirtschaft 1938 bis 1945 ,Fischer, Stuttgart, 1979, p. 65. 1950 onwards from OECD sources. Kausel’s estimates are corrected for territorial change, and refer to population and product within the present boundaries of Austria. Kausel (1979) also presented 1830–1913 estimates for Cisleithenia (the Austrian half of the Austro–Hungarian Empire). Other Cisleithenia included Bohemia, Moravia, Galicia, Bukowina, the Trieste region, and Dalmatia (subsequently parts of Czechoslavakia, Poland and Yugoslavia). Kausel was head of the national accounts division and subsequently Vice President of the Austrian Central Statistical Office. His 1979 article was part of a large–scale exercise in quantitative economic history to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the Statistical Office. The anniversary volume contained many other papers, including a comprehensive demographic analysis of the different components of the Austro–Hungarian Empire(“Die Bevölkerung Österrreich–Ungarns“, by H. Helczmanovszki). David Good and Tongshu Ma (1999), “The Economic Growth of Central and Eastern Europe in Comparative Perspective, 1870–1989“, European Review of Economic History , vol. 3, Part 2, pp. 105 and 107 reject the Kausel (1979) estimates as “back–of–the envelope“ calculations. They suggest a “more plausible“ alternative with “firmer foundations“. In fact, it is derived from regression and three proxy measures: letters posted per capita, crude birth rate, and share of non–agricultural employment in the labour force. Their estimate refers to 1870–1910 and shows slower growth than Kausel. In an earlier estimate, using five proxies and a different estimating procedure, Good (1994) appeared satisfied to have found growth “almost identical to that of Kausel“. The Good and Ma characterisation of Kausel’s direct estimate is inaccurate and there is no justification for dropping it in favour of their proxy for Austria. However, their other proxies are useful as they cover countries and periods for which direct estimates are not available (see HS–2 below).

Max–Stephan Schulze, “Patterns of Growth and Stagnation in the Late Nineteenth Century Habsburg Economy“, European Review of Economic History , December 2000, pp. 311–40 provides well– documented annual GDP and per capita GDP estimates for 1870–1913 for Cisleithenia and Transleithenia (the Hungarian half of the Habsburg Empire). He made no estimate for present–day Austria, but used Good and Ma results. He shows slower growth for present–day Austria than for Cisleithenia, whereas Kausel showed the opposite. Kausel’s 1913 per capita GDP was more than 60 per cent higher than he found for Cisleithenia. The Schulze differential is 29 per cent. Table 1–1 shows my estimates for 1830, 1870 and 1913 derived from Kausel; the bottom panel shows those of Schulze.

Carbonnelle, “Recherches sur l’évolution de la production en Belgique de 1900 à 1957“, Cahiers Économiques de Bruxelles , no. 3, April 1959, p. 358. Carbonnelle gives GDP figures for only a few benchmark years but gives a commodity production series for many more years. Interpolations were made for the service sector to arrive at a figure for GDP for all the years for which Carbonnelle shows total commodity production. GDP movement 1914–19 and 1939–47 are interpolations between the 1913 and 1920 estimates and those for 1938 and 1948 respectively, assuming the same pattern of movement as in France.

Estimates are adjusted to eliminate the impact of the acquisition of North Schleswig in 1921, which added 5.3 per cent to population, and 4.5 per cent to GDP. 

Finland: 1860–1960 GDP by industry of origin at market prices from R. Hjerppe, The Finnish Economy 1860–1985: Growth and Structural Change , Bank of Finland, Helsinki, l989, pp. 198–200. 1820–60 per capita GDP assumed to increase by 22.5 per cent, as indicated in S. Heikkinen, R. Hjerppe, Y. Kaukiainen, E. Markkanen and I. Nummela, “Förändringar i levnadsstandarden i Finland, 1750– 1913“ in G. Karlson, ed., Levestandarden i Norden 1750–1914 , Reykjavik, l987, p. 74. Population 1820–1950 from O. Turpeinen, Ikaryhmittainen kuolleisuus Suomessa vv. 1751–1970 , (Mortality by Age-group in Finland, 1751-1970 ), Helsinki, 1973. The 1940 and 1944 treaties which ceded territory to the USSR had no impact on population as all inhabitants were moved to Finland. 

France: GDP estimates for 1820–70 in Maddison (1995) have been revised. I used J–C. Toutain’s volume movement for agriculture and services, but not for industry where he showed much faster growth than other scholars (see Toutain, Le produit intérieur de la France de 1789 à 1982 , Presses Universitaires de Grenoble, 1987). Instead I used the industrial index of M. Levy–Leboyer and F. Bourguignon (1984) 

L’économie Francaise au XIXe siècle , using Toutain’s sector weights for 1870. Toutain has revised his 1820–70 estimates significantly (see J.–C. Toutain, “Le produit intérieur brut de la France, 1789–1990 “, 

ISMEA, Histoire et Sociétés, histoire économique et quantitative , 1, no. 11, 1997, pp. 5–136 Presses Universitaires de Grenoble), showing faster growth for services. I now use his new estimates for agriculture and services, together with the Levy–Leboyer/Bouguignon estimate for industry. Sources for 1870 onwards are unchanged–see Maddison (1995), pp.127–130. Growth rates of per capita GDP for 1500-1600 and 1700-1820 are unchanged, but modified for 1600-1700. For the second half of the seventeenth century I assume stagnant per capita income because of hunger crises and the depressing impact of more or less continuous warfare as noted by Boisguilbert and Vauban. Population and GDP estimates refer to the present territory of France, excluding the impact of the loss of Alsace–Lorraine 1871–1918 and acquisition of territory in 1861 (Savoie, Haute Savoie, Nice and surrounding parts of the Alpes Maritimes), which represented 600 000 of the 37 390 000 population of 1861. Population 1820–1860 from L. Henry and Y. Blayo, “La population de la France de 1740 à 1860“, Population ,November 1975, pp. 97–9; 1861–1950 from Annuaire statistique de la France , 1966, pp. 66–72. 

Germany: The present estimates refer to GDP and population within 1870 frontiers until 1918, 1936 frontiers for 1919–45, and present frontiers from 1946 onwards. Maddison 1995 provided estimates for 1820–1992 adjusted to exclude the impact of territorial change for the area of the Federal republic within its 1989 boundaries. As frontier changes have been very complicated it is difficult to make adjusted estimates at this stage for the whole period for reunified Germany. 

a) In 1871 Germany took Alsace–Lorraine from France. This increased its population and GDP by 4 per cent; 

b) between 1918 and 1922 Germany lost Alsace–Lorraine, Memel, Danzig, Eupen and Malmedy, Saarland, North Schleswig and Eastern Upper Silesia. These territories had a population of 7 330 000 in 1918 out of a total of 66 811 000 within the 1918 Reich frontiers, i.e. the old Reich was 12.3 per cent bigger in terms of population. However, as 1913 per capita income in the truncated area was 2.4 per cent higher than in the former Reich, the total income loss due to these changes was 9.7 per cent (for the population changes see A. Maddison, Dynamic Forces in Capitalist Development , 1991, pp. 232–5; for the per capita income difference see F. Grünig, “Die Anfänge der volkswirtschaftlichen Gesamtrechnung in Deutschland“, Beitrage zur empirischen Konjunkturforschung , Berlin, 1950, p. 76); The World Economy: Historical Statistics 406 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

c) in 1935, Germany regained the Saarland which added 1.79 per cent to population and income; 

d) in 1938, Germany incorporated Austria and took the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia. Later it took Alsace–Lorraine and parts of Poland and Yugoslavia. In 1941 these areas added 22.4 per cent to the GDP generated with the 1937 frontiers; 

e) after the second world war, Germany within its 1936 frontiers was effectively split between the Federal Republic, the DDR (East Germany) and the territory East of the Oder–Neisse which went to Poland, and to the USSR (Koenigsberg became Kaliningrad); 

f) in 1991, East German territory became part of the Federal Republic. A detailed account of German border changes and their impact on GDP can be found in Maddison (1977), “Phases of Capitalist Development“, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro Quarterly Review , no. 121, pp. 134 and Maddison (1995), p. 130–33. For the impact of territorial change on population see Maddison (1991), Dynamic Forces in Capitalist Development , pp.226–237. Maddison (2001), p. 178 provides a summary presentation of the impact of frontier change on population and GDP. Sources for GDP 1820–2001 were as follows: 1820, 1830 and 1850 derived from Tilly’s estimates for Prussia–see R.H. Tilly, “Capital Formation in Germany in the Nineteenth Century“, in P. Mathias and M.M. Postan (eds.), Cambridge Economic History of Europe , vol. VII, I, 1978, pp. 395, 420, and 441. Prussian per capita output in agriculture and industry were multiplied by population in Germany as a whole. Output in services was assumed to move with population. GDP aggregate estimated with 1850 weights for the three sectors from W.G. Hoffmann, F. Grumbach and H. Hesse, Das Wachstum der deutschen Wirtschaft seit der Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts , Springer, Berlin, 1965, p. 454. 1850–1938 annual GDP volume movement and link to 1950 derived from Hoffmann, Grumbach and Hesse, op. cit. , pp. 454–5. As Hoffmann et al. omit 1914–24, the pattern of movement in these years in industry and agriculture was derived from the output estimates of J. Dessirier, “Indices comparés de la production industrielle et production agricole en divers pays de 1870 à 1928“, Bulletin de la statistique générale de la France, Études spéciales , October–December 1928. Service output was interpolated between the 1913 and 1925 estimates of Hoffmann et al. for this sector. 1938–44 GNP in 1939 prices (from the expenditure side) for the 1938 territory (including Austria and Sudetenland) from W.C.

Figures are adjusted to offset territorial change. Greece gained independence from Turkey in the 1820s, and gradually extended its area to include the Ionian Islands in 1864, Thessaly in 1881, Crete ( de facto ) in 1898, Epirus, Macedonia, Thrace and the Aegean Islands in 1913, Rhodes and the rest of the Dodecanese in 1947. George Kostelenos, Money and Output in Modern Greece , Centre of Planning and Economic Research, Athens, 1995 provides annual estimates of output in current prices for primary, secondary and tertiary activity for 1858–1938. He does not estimate the volume of sector output, but constructs an aggregate deflator to derive a GDP estimate at 1914 prices (pp. 457–9). He measures growth of the money supply for the same period and uses the apparent velocity of circulation as a crosscheck on his GDP estimates (leading him to modify the results for 1858–9). Although Kostelenos throws more light on the available evidence than was previously available, there are three problems with his direct measure: a) his GDP deflator is very crude; with prices of only 11 items (6 for the whole period). All are agricultural or mining products, and the weights are gross output of the same items (in 1860, 1875, 1899, and 1914). The acceptibility of the GDP measure would be enhanced by construction of sectoral volume indices. I am not clear whether this is feasible, but it is certainly desirable. b) the second problem is territorial change. Kostelenos refers to Greece within the boundaries of the years he covers. His population figures show the impact of change very clearly. There were four major breaks: population jumped by 21 per cent in 1864, by 18 per cent in 1881, 77 per cent in 1913, and 15 per cent in 1920, but he does not discuss the problems this created in finding appropriate data on output, adjusting for differences in level between old and new territories, etc. His estimates suggest that these problems were difficult to resolve. For 1910–12 he shows a rise in per capita income of 63 per cent, a drop of a quarter in 1913, and a rise of a quarter in 1914. There is a similar problem for 1883–87 where his per capita GDP rises by nearly 90 per cent. It is not clear whether it is possible to accommodate these problems successfully, and one cannot criticise Kostelenos for attempting to overcome such an inherently difficult challenge. The third problem is that Kostelenos shows a very stagnant economy in the nineteenth century, with per capita income 6 per cent lower in 1910 than in 1860. If his estimates were linked to mine at 1938, per capita GDP in 1858 would be 1550 international 1990 dollars–a level similar to that in Germany and Sweden and about 70 per cent higher than the average for Eastern Europe. This seeems highly improbable. Recently, Kostelenos has revised his estimates, and his new results (in cooperation with Petmezas and others), show much faster and smoother growth, and are carried back to 1833. The main reason for faster growth is the use of a new deflator — a “rolling index“ with a moving base, merging segments with weights of 1860, 1886 and 1914 respectively. The results are more plausible, but are still tentative. They will be more fully explained in a forthcoming publication of the National Bank of Greece. See Kostelenos (2001), “Economic Growth and Inequality in Greece in the 19th and 20th Century: A Tentative Approach“, available on the Groningen website: www.eco.rug.nl/ggdc. 

Ireland: For Ireland before 1920, see note below for the United Kingdom. 1920 per capita GDP level taken to be 54 per cent of that in the UK (excluding Southern Ireland) as estimated by C.H. Feinstein,

Italy: 1820 and annual 1861–1970 GDP movement from A. Maddison, “A Revised Estimate of Italian Economic Growth 1861–1989“, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro Quarterly Review , June 1991. The official ISTAT estimates I used for 1970 onwards have a more complete coverage of the underground economy than is the case in other countries (20.2 per cent of total GDP). In other countries, underground activities which escape the net of official national accounts statisticians are typically about 3 per cent of GDP (see D. Blades, “The Hidden Economy and the National Accounts“, OECD, Occasional Studies ,June 1982, p. 39). I therefore made a 3 per cent downward adjustment to the benchmark level of GDP to enhance international comparability. This has no effect on GDP volume movement, but reduces the level for all years. 1820 population derived from K.J. Beloch, Bevölkerungsgeschichte Italiens , de Gruyter, Berlin, 1961, pp. 351–4; annual change in resident population, 1861–1950 from Sommario di statistiche storiche dell Italia, 1861 –1975 , Istat, Rome, 1976, adjusted to midyear. Annual estimates for 1821–61 derived by logarithmic interpolation; average annual growth was 0.644 per cent. Galloway’s estimates for Northern Italy show an annual growth rate of 0.703 per cent for the period I interpolated (see P.R. Galloway, “A Reconstruction of the Population of Northern Italy from 1650 to 1881 using Annual Inverse Projection“, European Journal of Population , 10, 1994, pp. 223–274). Population and GDP are adjusted to eliminate the impact of territorial change. In 1866, after the war with Austria, the Venetian territories became part of Italy, and after 1870 the Papal states were added. In 1919 South Tirol, the old Austrian Kustenland provinces and the port of Zara were acquired. Fiume was added in 1922. In 1945, Zara, Fiume and part of Venezia–Giulia were ceded to Yugoslavia. Until the settlement of 1954 Trieste was in dispute and under international occupation; thereafter the city and a strip of coast went to Italy and the hinterland to Yugoslavia. In 1947, Tenda and Briga were added to France. The impact of these changes can be seen in Maddison (1995), p. 231.

Norway: 1865–1950 GDP by category of expenditure at constant market prices from National Accounts 1865–1960 , Central Bureau of Statistics, Oslo, 1965, pp. 348–59, with gross fixed investment adjusted downwards by a third to eliminate repairs and maintenance. For the 1939–44 gap in these estimates, I used the movement in national income (excluding shipping and whaling operations carried out from Allied bases 1940–4) from O. Aukrust and P.J. Bjerve, Hva krigen kostet Norge , Dreyers, Oslo, 1945, p. 45. 1945 assumed to be midway between 1944 and 1946. For 1820–65 I assume per capita GDP movement was the same as in Sweden. There are interesting estimates of GDP back to 1835 in F. Hodne and O. H. Grytten, “Gross Domestic Product of Norway 1835-1915”, Occasional Papers in Economic History, Umeå University, 1994. They adjust and link three nineteenth century spot estimates for 1835, 1845 and 1850 with the official estimate for 1865. They show faster growth than I have assumed (their per capita estimate for 1850 is about one fifth lower than mine). A more definitive estimate for 1820-65 will probably emerge when the Nordic Group complete their review of estimates for Scandinavia.

Portugal: Annual GDP movement 1851–1910 derived from C. Bardini, A. Carreras and Pedro Lains, “The National Accounts for Italy, Spain and Portugal“, Scandinavian Economic History Review ,1, 1995, p.135. They estimate agricultural and industrial output and use the combined movement in these two sectors to measure aggregate physical output, which they use as a proxy for GDP movement. I used their estimates for agriculture and industry, and derived a crude measure of GDP, using sector weights for 1910 and assuming that half of output in the rest of the economy (trade, transport and Western Europe, 1500–2001 409 

services) moved parallel to population and half parallel to aggregate physical ouput. GDP 1910–58 and 1910 sector weights from D. Batista, C. Martins, M. Pinheiro, and J. Reis, “New Estimates for Portugal’s GDP, 1910–1958“, Bank of Portugal and European University Institute, October, 1997. There are annual estimates of GDP movement 1834–1946 in A.B. Nunes, E. Mata, and N. Valerio, “Portuguese Economic Growth, 1833–1985“, Journal of European Economic History , Fall, 1989, They were derived by regression, using three proxy indicators (exports, fiscal receipts and public expenditure) and their relationship to GDP movement for 1947–85. For 1834–51 they show a bumpy trajectory, without much indication of growth. This was a period of political and economic instability, following the upheavals of the Napoleonic wars and loss of the Brazilian Empire. I used their estimate of the 1850– 51 movement and assumed that the per capita GDP level in 1820 was the same as in 1850.

# HS–2: W ESTERN O FFSHOOTS : 1500–2001 (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States) 

These four countries have experienced much more rapid growth since 1820 than Western Europe or the rest of the world. Between 1820 and 2001 their combined population increased 35–fold, compared with less than 3–fold in Western Europe. Their GDP increased 679–fold compared with 47–fold in Western Europe. Average per capita GDP (in terms of 1990 international dollars) rose from $1 202 to $26 943; Western Europe’s from $1 204 to $19 256. The disparity was due partly to huge differences in natural resource endowment. In 1820, land per head of population in France, Germany and the United Kingdom averaged 1.5 hectares compared to 240 hectares in the Western Offshoots. Their growth was facilitated by large–scale immigration, foreign investment and distance from foreign wars. They inherited institutional arrangements and traditions which gave them political stability, a fair degree of social mobility, relatively high levels of education, secure property rights, and a willingness to use market forces, which were more favourable to growth than was the case of the Iberian offshoots in Latin America.

In the past, most measures of their performance have concentrated on the economies created by European settlement, and disregarded the fact that they displaced and destroyed indigenous economies whose output and populations contracted. I have attempted to provide a crude measure of this disruptive impact up to 1870, estimating what Noel Butlin called a “multicultural“ estimate of GDP. For the indigenous economies the population figures are rough and the per capita GDP estimates are stylised. For the settler economies the estimates are at least as good as those for Western Europe. 

Australia: Australia has a distinguished record of national income measurement. It was the first country with official estimates. . They were started in 1886 by Timothy Coghlan (1857–1926), government statistician for New South Wales who published estimates of the Wealth and Progress of New South Wales as well as a Statistical Abstract for the Seven Colonies of Australasia covering New Zealand and the six colonies which became the constituent states of Australia. Publication was discontinued in 1905 when he accepted a diplomatic post as agent general for New South Wales in London, and official national accounts did not reappear until 1946. Bryan Haig is the custodian of the Coghlan archive, and has written an as yet unpublished memoir on Coghlan’s work “The First Official National Accounting Estimates“ (see also Heinz Arndt, “A Pioneer of National Income Estimates“, Economic Journal , December, 1949). In 1938, Colin Clark (1905–89) and John Crawford (1910-84) published estimates of income and product for the 1920s and 30s, annual estimates of real income for 1914–39, and rough estimates of productivity for some years back to 1886 (see their National Income of Australia , Angus and Robertson, Sydney, 1938). Clark used this material in the first edition of Conditions of Economic Progress , 1940, pp. 84–5, improved on it in the 1951 edition, pp. 140–1, and modified his estimates showing faster growth of real product for 1914–38 in the 1957 edition, pp. 90–7 (see Table 2–4). Noel Butlin (1921–91) published a continuous stream of studies on the quantitative economic history of Australia from 1946 onwards (see Graeme Snooks, “Life and Work of Noel George Butlin“, 

Australian Economic History Review , September 1991). He was an admirer of Kuznets and much of his work is in the Kuznetsian tradition with meticulous indication of sources and transparent explanation of methodology. His first major book (1962) provided annual estimates of GDP, GNP, net domestic and net national product from 1861 to1938/9. It showed nominal and real value added by industry of origin at factor cost and market prices, together with very detailed estimates of capital formation and the balance of payments on current and capital account. It contained more than 200 pages describing his sources and estimating procedures, and 274 tables. As Butlin’s work covered the whole span of Australian history, I relied heavily on his estimates in Maddison (1995 and 2001). 1820 to 1828 GDP movement was derived from N.G. Butlin, “Our 200 Years“, Queensland Calendar , 1988. 1828–60 annual GDP volume movement by eight industries of origin at 1848–50 prices from N.G.

Where necessary, GDP figures were adjusted to a calendar year basis. Population 1788–1949 from Butlin (1988), adjusted to a calendar year basis from 1870. Butlin’s estimate of the pre–contact population is much higher than is conventional (1.1 million instead of 300 000). His analysis of the destructive impact of white settlement makes it difficult to accept the conventional estimate, but his depopulation coefficient seems exaggerated. As a compromise, I assumed a pre–contact population of 450 000, 1820–70 from L.R. Smith, The Aboriginal Population of Australia , ANU, Canberra, 1980, p. 210. Western Offshoots 451 

Recently, Bryan Haig rejected Butlin’s estimates en bloc (see his “New Estimates of Australian GDP: 1861–1948/49“, Australian Economic History Review , March 2001, pp. 1–34). He argues that Butlin’s approach (deflation of nominal estimates of value added by price indices) is “unworkable“ because of the weakness of existing price indices, and the inherent difficulty of improving them; Butlin “relied on existing series of wholesale prices, wage rates and retail price indices“, and “no useful research has been undertaken by academics on Australian price indices since Butlin produced his estimates“. Butlin did not take his price indices from the shelf, but constructed ten special deflators for sectors of GDP, and eight for components of capital investment. Butlin’s deflators are imperfect but improvable. Australian academics have not abandoned the field (see Ian McLean and S.J. Woodland “Consumer Prices in Australia, 1850– 1914“ Working Paper 92–4 , Economics Dept, University of Adelaide, 1992), and Australia seems better endowed with historical price statistics than many other countries (see Shergold’s chapter in Vamplew,1987). Haig’s second fundamental objection is that Butlin’s results are “unreasonable“ as they show contours of development which conflict with traditional views and generated a new interpretation of Australian economic history. I see no harm in this. It is up to those who disagree with Butlin to prove him wrong. Table 2-3. Alternative Measures of Australian Sector Growth and Structure, 1861-1938/9

A more legitimate objection is that Butlin probably exaggerated the long boom from 1861 to 1891 by understating manufacturing employment and output at the beginning of the period. This is a point which Haig should have tackled more rigorously, showing his own employment estimates for Australian manufacturing and comparing them with those of Butlin (see Butlin and Dowie, “Estimates of Australian Work Force and Employment, 1861–1961“, Australian Economic History Review ,September, 1969). Instead he presents a comparison for the state of Victoria. Haig’s alternative to the Butlin approach is to use quantitative measures of output for seven sectors of GDP. This is a desirable crosscheck, but for 1861–1911 Haig does not have quantitative measures for 70 per cent of GDP, and uses employment (available in direct form only for NSW and Victoria) as a proxy. He amalgamates his sector estimates using 1891 output weights which Coghlan published in 1893. Although he makes a few comparisons between his results and those of Butlin they are limited and casual. A further problem is that Haig describes his estimating procedure parsimoniously in five pages whereas Butlin provided 200. Table 2–4 facilitates systematic confrontation of their sector growth rates and structure (Butlin’s value added and Coghlan’s gross output). Haig relies heavily on measures for New South Wales and Victoria to fill gaps in information for Australia as a whole, whereas Butlin covers a wider and perhaps more representative range of states. For 1861–1911, Haig’s estimates imply per capita growth of 1.6 per cent a year in NSW, 0.42 in Victoria, and 0.57 per cent in Australia. For 1911–12 to 1938–39, Haig’s estimates are of better quality. He has quantity indicators for manufacturing from his “Manufacturing Output and Productivity, 1910 to 1948/9“, Australian Economic History Review , September, 1975. For the rest of the economy he was able to adjust his employment indicators for productivity change. The weights from his “1938/9 National Income Estimates“, Australian Economic History Review , 1967, p. 176, are also more satisfactory. I have now adopted Haig’s estimates for 1911–38, but would like to see more detail of his evidence before adopting his estimates for 1861–1911. All the above refers to the white settler economy. In the 1980s Butlin made a major innovation in proposing a “multicultural“ estimate. In 1983 he published a masterpiece of demographic modelling (Our Original Aggression , Allen & Unwin, Sydney and London) analysing the impact of white settlement on the Aboriginal population and its economy, with detailed specification of the different vectors of mortality. This was similar in intent to studies by Borah and others on the impact of European conquest on the Americas, but Butlin was much more rigorous. His analysis of Aboriginal history was enlarged in Economics and the Dreamtime: A Hypothetical History, Cambridge University Press, 1993. A further posthumous work Forming A Colonial Economy: Australia 1810–1850 , Cambridge University Press, appeared in 1994.

United States: GDP Estimates 

1700–1820: Robert Gallman, “The Pace and Pattern of American Economic Growth“, in L. Davis and Associates (eds.), American Economic Growth: An Economist’s History of the United States , Harper and Row, New York, 1972, estimated per capita growth in net national product of 0.42 per cent a year between 1710 and 1840 (taking the mid–point of the range he suggested for 1710). His figures refer to the neo–European economy of the white and black population. Adjusting for the faster growth of their per capita income in 1820–40 (see below), Gallman’s estimate implies a per capita growth of about 0.29 per cent a year from 1700 to 1820 (from a level of $909 to $1 286). Assuming an unchanged per capita income of $400 a year in the indigenous hunter–gatherer economy, the average level for the whole population would have risen from $527 in 1700 to $1 257 in 1820.

P.C. Mancall and Weiss, “Was Econonomic Growth Likely in British North America?“, Journal of Economic History , March 1999, made a “multicultural“ estimate which shows much slower growth for the eighteenth century. I consider their growth rate to be much too slow, given the huge change in the relative size of the neo–European and indigenous populations. They show no figures for total population or GDP, so it is not possible to replicate their multicultural measure. They make no reference to the Gallman estimate I used. 

1820–2001 

Modern GDP estimation relies heavily on the massive contribution of Simon Kuznets. He took over the NBER research in this field around 1930, and also prepared the first official estimates, National Income 1929–32 , which were transmitted to the Finance Committee of the US Senate by the Dept. of Commerce in January 1934. This showed the flows of different categories of income broken down by industry together with corresponding employment estimates prepared by Robert Nathan. A cost of living index was provided as a tentative deflator, together with very fully documented appendices with sources. This approach was further elaborated in S. Kuznets, National Income and Its Composition 1919–38 , NBER, New York, 1941, which contained estimates (at current and 1929 prices) of the industrial distribution of different categories of income (wage, property, and entrepreneurial). Kuznets also derived estimates by category of expenditure for 1919 onwards by the “commodity flow“ method, i.e. he used census and other information on production, and determined what part represented the final flow to consumers and capital formation. These flows from producers were given distributive mark–ups to reflect final sales values. Rougher estimates were made for services. This work was sponsored by the Committee on Credit and Banking which was interested in commodity flows as a counterpart to its interest in flows of financial resources. The details of this approach are described in S. Kuznets, Commodity Flow and Capital Formation , NBER, New York, 1938. The expenditure estimates were extended back to 1869 in S. Kuznets, L. Epstein and E. Jenks, National Product Since 1869 , NBER, New York, 1946 (but these referred to overlapping decades and were not annual). This extension back to 1869 relied very heavily on W.H. Shaw, Value of Commodity Output Since 1869 , NBER, New York, 1947, who used the same procedure for making commodity flow estimates of values as Kuznets (1938) did. Shaw also supplied price deflators. Estimates in the same form can also be found (in an analytical context) in S. Kuznets, Income and Wealth of the United States: Trends and Structure , Income and Wealth Series II, Bowes and Bowes, Cambridge, 1952. This study contains an annex on the estimates for 1800 to 1870 by Martin and King. Kuznets had a poor opinion of these, and although he did not produce alternative estimates, he gave a clear indication of the direction in which they were biased, and some clues for constructing estimates with limited information. The final version of Kuznets’ massive work appeared in his Capital in the American Economy ,NBER, Princeton, 1961. Here he published annual estimates of GNP by type of expenditure in current and in 1929 dollars (pp. 555–8) back to 1889. As the underlying census information was inadequate before 1889, he showed only 5–year moving averages back to 1871 (pp. 559–64). He had three variants of GNP with different assumptions about which products were intermediate. The US Department of Commerce did not adopt the Kuznets’ definitions of the scope of GNP. He explained his disagreement with their procedures in S. Kuznets, “Discussion of the New Department of Commerce Income Series“, Review of Economics and Statistics , August 1948. The official side was not convinced by his arguments, see M. Gilbert, G. Jaszi, E.F. Denison and C.F. Schwartz, “Objectives of National Income Measurement: A Reply to Professor Kuznets“ in the same publication. The Kuznets estimates were published in transparent form with the full scholarly apparatus characteristic of the NBER. It was therefore possible for John Kendrick (who in any case had access to the worksheets) to convert the Kuznets annual estimates of GNP (variant III) back to 1889 (with some minor adjustment) by type of expenditure to a Dept. of Commerce basis, see J.W. Kendrick, Productivity Trends The World Economy: Historical Statistics 456 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

in the United States , NBER, Princeton, 1961, pp. 298–9. Like Kuznets, Kendrick used fixed 1929 weights for his volume estimates, but he also gave a chain weighted alternative, which for 1889–1929 shows a growth rate of 3.82 per cent a year compared with 3.68 for his fixed weight index for the private domestic economy (p. 327). For 1869–1889 Kendrick presented only decade averages, as it seemed probable that they exaggerated growth. Kendrick (1961) augmented the NBER sectoral production studies (by Barger, Fabricant and others) to show annual movements in output or value added on an annual basis back to 1869 in many cases. However, he did not construct an estimate of GDP by industry of origin. His aggregate (pp. 302–3) covers 9 production sectors in combination with total private GDP by type of expenditure. The bulk of private service activity was derived as a residual. Even then his estimates were presented only for 10 benchmark years. Thus we have the paradox that the United States is one of the few countries where the construction of historical accounts by industry of origin has been neglected, though the statistical basis for such estimates is better than elsewhere. 

1820–40: For this period the evidence is still rather weak, and one must still rely on the kind of reasoning which Kuznets (1952) first applied, and which can be found in P.A. David, “The Growth of Real Product in the United States before 1840: New Evidence, Controlled Conjectures“, Journal of Economic History , June 1967, and more recently in T. Weiss, “US Labor Force Estimates and Economic Growth, 1800–1860“, in R.E. Gallman and J.J. Wallis, eds., American Economic Growth and Standards of Living Before the Civil War , University of Chicago Press, 1992, p. 27. I used a variant of the Kuznets– David inferential approach. I calculated agricultural productivity 1820–40, taking agricultural value added (output of crops and livestock products plus change in livestock inventories, minus intermediate products consumed) from M.W. Towne and W.D. Rasmussen, “Farm Gross Product and Gross Investment in the Nineteenth Century“, in Parker, ed. (1960), p. 25, and agricultural employment from Weiss (1992), p. 51. Agricultural productivity (thus measured) grew by .62 per cent a year from 1820–40. Like Kuznets and David, I assumed that productivity growth in the rest of the economy was faster (1 per cent a year). Although service productivity growth is likely to have been modest, the assumption of faster growth in non–agriculture seems warranted as K.L. Sokoloff found manufacturing productivity to have grown by 2.2 per cent a year, see his “Productivity Growth in Manufacturing During Early Industrialisation: Evidence from the American Northeast, 1820–1860“, in S.L. Engerman and R.E. Gallmann, Long Term Factors in American Economic Growth , Chicago, 1986, p. 695. 

1840–69: derived from Robert Gallman who revised and extended the Kuznets estimates backwards (variant I) using the same commodity flow approach and techniques of presentation. He first estimated value added (in 1879 prices) for agriculture, mining, manufacturing and construction for benchmark years, see R.E. Gallman, “Commodity Output, 1839–1899“, in W.N. Parker, Trends in the American Economy in the Nineteenth Century , NBER, Princeton, 1960, p. 43. He used these results, census, and other information to construct his estimates of GNP by type of expenditure (four–way breakdown of consumption and three–way breakdown of capital formation) in 1860 prices, see R.E. Gallman, “Gross National Product in the United States 1834–1909“, in D.S. Brady, ed., Output, Employment and Productivity in the United States after 1800 , NBER, New York, 1966, p. 26. Unfortunately he provided figures only for five benchmark years, 1839, 1844, 1849, 1854, and 1859 and for overlapping decades from 1834–43 to 1899–1908, and did not publish the full detail of his procedures. 

1869–90: from N.S. Balke and R.J. Gordon, “The Estimation of Prewar Gross National Product: Methodology and New Evidence“, Journal of Political Economy , February 1989, p. 84. They revamped the Gallman–Kendrick–Kuznets commodity flow estimates, using additional information on construction, transport and communications, to provide annual estimates of nominal GNP, real GNP and a GNP deflator. For 1869–90, their average annual estimate for real GNP growth was 4.16 per cent a year, which is lower than the unpublished Kendrick figure of 5.44 per cent, or the 5.55 per cent of Kuznets. As both Kuznets and Kendrick thought their 1869 level (as described above) was too low, the Balke– Gordon estimate seems acceptable.

White and black population, 1630–1949 from Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970 , US Department of Commerce, 1975, pp. 8 and 1168. The figures refer to the present territory of the United States. 1820–1949 increased by 0.39 per cent to include Alaska and Hawaii, incorporated in l950. 1950–2001 from International Programs Center, US Bureau of the Census. In 1820, the territory of the United States was half of what it is today. The increase was due to the acquisition of Texas, California and other Western lands from Mexico between 1845 and 1853. The settlement of the border with Canada brought in the territory which is now Idaho, Oregon and Washington in 1846. These territories were sparsely settled and consisted very largely of the indigenous population which was not separately specified in US censuses before 1860. Before 1890 the censuses excluded those living in Indian territory or reservations. I added 325 000 for the indigenous population in 1820 and 180 000 for 1850, (see Maddison, 1995, p. 97). 

## Three Recent Modifications in US Official Measures of GDP 

Annual Chain Indices for GDP : The official figures I use for 1950 onwards are based on a chain index as described in J.S. Landefeld and R.P. Parker, “BEA’s Chain Indexes, Time Series and Measures of Long Term Growth“, Survey of Current Business , May 1997. This is an index where the weights change every year. The annual GDP volume change is measured by a Fisher index which is the geometric mean of two indices, one of which (a Laspeyres index) uses the prices of year t-1 as weights, and the other (a Paasche index) uses prices of year t. Annual changes calculated this way are multiplied together to form a time series. This procedure is a sharp break with the tradition of the Department of Commerce which for six decades used a fixed weight for the whole period it covered (though the chosen year was changed quinquennially). Before making the switch, BEA experimented with alternative weighting systems. A.H. Young, “Alternative Measures of Changes in Real Output and Prices, Quarterly Estimates for 1959–92“, Survey of Current Business , March 1993 presented three alternative indices for 1959– 92. The old fixed weight index showed a real GDP growth rate of 2.88 a year, the annual Fisher chain index 3.12 per cent and a Fisher index with weights changed every 5 years 3.16 a year. In Maddison (1995) I used the third measure because it was closer to the procedure used in other OECD countries at that time. BEA did not present these three options for earlier years as it announced. Instead it made a sudden switch to chain indexation back to 1929. The new measure shows a GDP growth of 3.5 per cent a year for 1929–50, the traditional measure 2.6 per cent. This is a much bigger difference between fixed and chain weights than Young found for 1959–92 or Kendrick for 1889–1929. Acceptance of the new measure for this period would involve a major reinterpretation of American economic history. It implies a GDP level in 1929 16 per cent lower than the old index and would lower the level for earlier years. If used as a The World Economy: Historical Statistics 458 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

link, it would imply a US level of labour productivity in 1913 below that in the United Kingdom. The new BEA index also changes the picture of the war and immediate postwar recovery. It seems hazardous to use it for 1929–50 without further investigation of the reasons why the new method had such a big impact. One must also remember that no other country uses a chain index technique for such a long period in the past. 

Hedonic Indices for the New Economy : A major reason why BEA switched to chain indexation was its adoption of “hedonic“ price indices for computers and peripherals in 1985 and extended use of this type of measure back to 1959. By the year 2000, the components of GDP deflated by this technique represented 18 per cent of the total (see J.S. Landefeld and B.T. Grimm, “A Note on the Impact of Hedonics and Computers on Real GDP“, Survey of Current Business , December 2000). This technique imputes quality improvements by specifying computing power in terms of several characteristics, e.g. speed, memory etc. and estimating price change by regression. The manufacturers of computers were understandably helpful in suppying detail of these improved characteristics and the application of hedonic techniques to the measuerement of computer prices was in fact pioneered by IBM. The hedonic measure implied that prices dropped 32 per cent a year from 1994 onwards. If this rate had prevailed for the 1990s, it would mean that a consumer who spent $1 000 on a computer in 1990 and again in 2000, would be getting sixteen times as much for his money in the latter year. Hedonic weights (advocated since 1961 by Zvi Griliches) are perfectly respectable, but one can be a bit sceptical about the assumption that quality change was so large and monotonically positive. The hedonic techniques used by BEA imply a direct connection between computing power (speed, memory etc.) and computer output without considering the quality of the software that converts power to output. In addition, hedonic techniques assume competitive markets where prices accurately reflect consumer utility, but recent anti–trust cases suggest that this assumption may be unrealistic. One would like to see a more rigorous and detailed examination of alternatives and a smaller dose of euphoric reassurance that the results are robust. However, adoption of annual chain weights helped moderate the accelerative impact of hedonic indices on GDP growth. 

Treatment of Computer Software as Investment : A third innovation which raised the level of GDP modestly and raised the growth rate, was the decision to treat computer software as investment rather than as an intermediate product. This practice was introduced in 1999 and applied retrospectively to 1959. The average service life for such investment is assumed (rather generously) to be 3–5 years (see BEA, “Recognition of Software as Investment in the US National Accounts“, OECD Meeting of National Accounts Experts , September 1999). The change was recommended in the 1993 revision of the System of National Accounts of EU, IMF, OECD and World Bank, and has been adopted by other OECD countries. Given the fact that hedonic indexation already makes generous allowance for quality change in computers which derive in large part from improved software, there is an element of double– counting in the new procedure. It is also a little odd to treat this rapidly depreciating advance in knowledge as investment, whilst ignoring the more durable impact of scientific academies. However, the hallowed status of computer technology seems to be firmly esconced in most statistical offices. Western Offshoots 459

# HS–3: A. E ASTERN E UROPE AND F ORMER USSR 

Until 1990, there were 8 countries in this group, 5 still have the same frontiers, but 22 successor states have emerged, 2 from Czechoslovakia, 5 from Yugoslavia, and 15 from USSR. The tables show GDP, population and per capita GDP for the 8 countries, 1820–2001 within their 1989 frontiers and 1990–2001 for the 22 successor states within their new boundaries. The former DDR (German Democratic Republic) lasted from 1946 to 1990, when it was absorbed into the Federal Republic. As the estimates for Germany in HS–1 include the area of the former DDR, it is not shown here (see Maddison, 1995, p.132 for East German population and GDP, 1936–1993). 

Estimates for 1820–2001 

POPULATION : 1950 onwards all countries of Eastern Europe and the former USSR from the International Programs Center of the US Bureau of the Census, October 2002 revision. For 1820–1949, I have made some revisions and filled gaps from Colin McEvedy and Richard Jones (1978), Atlas of World Population History, Penguin, London. They provide estimates adjusted throughout to 1978 frontiers. Sources for 1820–1949 are indicated in the country notes below. 

GDP LEVELS : sources are indicated in the country notes below. For 1820–1913, there are significant gaps in the GDP estimates for Eastern European countries, which makes it difficult to get meaningful group totals and averages. I have therefore used the proxy estimates of Good and Ma (1999) to fill most of these gaps as indicated below. In all cases the GDP estimates for the communist period have been adjusted to correspond to the norms of the UN standardised system of national accounts. The problems in doing this and the relevant sources are discussed in Maddison (1995), pp. 139–43 and in Maddison “Measuring the Performance of a Communist Command Economy: An Assessment of CIA Estimates for the USSR”, Review of Income and Wealth , September, 1998. 

Albania: 1950 and 1990 GDP levels from Maddison, 1995, p. 217. 1870–1950 per capita GDP was assumed to move in the same proportion as the average for the other 6 East European countries.

Lazarcik, “Czechoslovak Gross National Product by Sector of Origin and Final Use, 1937, and 1948–65”, Occasional Paper 26, Research Project on National Income in East Central Europe, New York, 1969. 1965–90 as for Bulgaria. 1990– 2001 for Czech republic from OECD sources; Slovakia from Statistics Division, Economic Commission for Europe. Population 1820–50 from McEvedy and Jones (1978), 1870–1910 supplied by David Good, 1913–49 as for Bulgaria. 

Hungary: 1870–1900 GDP from Max–Stephan Schulze, “Patterns of Growth and Stagnation in the Late Nineteenth Century Habsburg Economy”, European Review of Economic History , no. 4, 2000, pp. 311– 340. Schulze’s estimates refer to imperial Hungary, but the movement he shows is the best available proxy for development within present frontiers. 1900–38 net national product within present frontiers from A. Eckstein, “National Income and Capital Formation in Hungary, 1900–50”, in S. Kuznets, ed.,

Thereafter from OECD sources. Population 1820–70 assumed to grow at the same pace as in imperial Hungary as shown in Kausel (1985), p. 12. 1870–1949 as for Bulgaria. Friedich von Fellner estimated the breakdown of population, income, and wealth between present– day Hungary and other successor states of imperial Hungary for 1910. Present–day Hungary had 36.7 per cent of the population (7 605 thousand out of a total 20 745) and 39.7 per cent of the national income. 21.4 per cent of income went to an area which became part of Romania, 20.2 to Yugoslavia, 16.9 to Czechoslovakia and 1.8 per cent to present–day Austria. See “Die Verteilung des Volksvermögens und Volkseinkommens der Länder der ungarischen Heiligen Krone zwischen dem heutigen Ungarn und der Successions–Staaten”, Metron , July 1923, pp. 302–3. Per capita income was about 8 per cent higher in present–day Hungary than in the rest.

USSR: 1820–70 per capita GDP movement assumed to parallel the average for Eastern Europe. 1870–1913 volume movement of GDP components from R.W. Goldsmith, “The Economic Growth of Tsarist Russia 1860–1913”, Economic Development and Cultural Change , April 1961, pp. 450, and 462– 3. I used his estimates of crop and livestock output, his industrial index and estimate for handicraft activity. I assumed forestry and fishing to move parallel to agriculture; construction, transport and communication parallel to industry. I used 1913 weights for the components from M.E. Falkus, “Russia’s National Income 1913: A Revaluation”, Economica , February 1968, pp. 62 and 67. For 1913–28, I used the same technique of estimation and weights, taking net agricultural product from S.G. Wheatcroft in R.W. Davies, ed., From Tsarism to the New Economic Policy , Macmillan, London, 1990, p. 279, and industrial output from G.W.

Nutter, The Growth of Industrial Production in the Soviet Union , NBER, Princeton, 1962, p. 519. For the Tsarist period to 1928 there are alternative estimates by P.R. Gregory, Russian National Income 1885–1913 , Cambridge University Press, 1982, pp. 56–7. He measures expenditure components (private consumption, government current spending, and investment) in current prices and deflates by price indices. The two methods concord well. The industry of origin approach yields a GDP index of 43.2 for 1890, 66.3 for 1900 and 100.0 for 1913. Gregory’s two net national product alternatives average 42.9, 66.2 and 100.0 for these years. 

Proxy Estimates to Fill Gaps in GDP Estimates for Eastern Europe, 1820–1913 

David Good and Tongshu Ma, “The Economic Growth of Central and Eastern Europe, 1870–1989”, 

European Review of Economic History , August 1999 provide proxy estimates of the level and movement of GDP per capita for the years 1870, 1890 and 1910 for Austria and 6 East European countries. For the 1920s onwards they used Maddison (1995) estimates, and my numeraire (1990 international Geary– Khamis dollars). These estimates are shown as relatives to the United States. Virtually identical results are given in Good and Ma (1998), “New Estimates of Income levels in Central and Eastern Europe, 1870– 1910”, in F. Baltzarek, F. Butschek and G. Tichy (eds.), (1998), Von der Theorie zur Wirtschaftspolitik–ein österreichische Weg , Lucius, Stuttgart, where they are shown as levels rather than relatives. In 1998, they showed figures for 1880 and 1900, but not the link with years after the first world war. Their proxy estimates are derived by regression using three indicators (letters posted per capita, crude birth rate and the share of non–agricultural employment in the labour force). The relationship of GDP per capita to this cocktail of indicators is tested for 12 countries deemed to have reasonably good national income data. Although I reject the proxies as a substitute for direct estimates, they seem plausible enough to fill gaps in the database until direct estimates become available. Table 3–1 shows their proxies. Table 3–2 shows my estimates and my use of their proxies (in italics). I extrapolated the proxies to 1913, using 1900–1910 growth rates. Per capita proxies were multiplied by population to derive GDP. The World Economy: Historical Statistics 472 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

Estimates for 1500–1820 

Population 1500–1820 from McEvedy and Jones (1978), except for Hungary 1820, as noted above. Direct estimates of GDP movement for 1500–1820 are not available. As a proxy, I assumed slower per capita growth than in Western Europe at 0.1 per cent per annum for 1500–1820 (as I did in Maddison, 1995). It should be noted that the Good and Ma proxies refer mostly to territory within the Austro– Hungarian empire where comparison was facilitated by the existence of a currency and customs union. Their estimates are likely to be less representative for Poland, where only 15 per cent of the population lived within the borders of the Habsburg empire. Table 3-1.

# HS–4: L ATIN A MERICA 1500–1820s: Impact of Conquest and Colonisation on Output and Population 

At the end of the fifteenth century, at the time of Spanish conquest, the Americas were thinly settled. The population was a third of that in Western Europe and the land area eleven times as large. The technological level was greatly inferior. There were no wheeled vehicles or draught animals, no metal tools, weapons or ploughs. There were no cattle, sheep, pigs or hens. The most densely populated areas (Mexico and Peru) had significant urban centres and a sophisticated vegetarian agriculture. Elsewhere, most of the inhabitants were hunter–gatherers. American populations had no resistance to European (smallpox, measles, influenza and typhus) and African diseases (yellow fever and malaria). By the middle of the sixteenth century two thirds of them were wiped out. Mortality was twice that of Europe during the Black Death of the fourteenth century. The two advanced civilisations (Aztec in Mexico and Inca in Peru) were destroyed. Their populations were reduced to anomie and serfdom. Hunter–gatherer populations elsewhere were marginalised or exterminated. The economy of these relatively empty lands was completely revamped. The Latin part of the continent was repopulated by shipment of 7.5 million African slaves and arrival of 1.5 million European settlers. By 1820, 22 per cent of the population were white, 24 per cent black or mulatto, 37 per cent indigenous and 16 per cent mestizo. European settlers had higher fertility, longer life expectation, and very much higher average incomes than African slaves and the indigenous population. Although the initial impact of conquest was massively destructive, the long–term economic potential was greatly enhanced. Capacity to support a bigger population was augmented by the introduction of new crops and animals. The new items were wheat, rice, sugar cane, vines, cabbages, lettuce, olives, bananas, yams and coffee. The new animals for food were cattle, pigs, chickens, sheep and goats. The introduction of transport and traction animals — horses, oxen, asses and mules — along with wheeled vehicles and ploughs (which replaced digging sticks) were a major contribution to productive capacity. There was a reciprocal transfer of New World crops to Europe, Asia and Africa– maize, potatoes, sweet potatoes, manioc, chilis, tomatoes, groundnuts, haricot, lima and string beans, pineapples, cocoa and tobacco–which enhanced the rest of the world’s production capacity and ability to sustain population growth. The experience of the Americas from 1500 to 1820 was very different from other continents. The demographic catastrophe of the sixteenth century and the collapse of the indigenous economy had no parallel elsewhere. Population and output recovered somewhat in the seventeenth century, but in 1700 were still well below 1500 levels. Growth accelerated in the eighteenth century. By 1820, GDP was twice as big as in 1500, and average per capita income above the world average. The economy, technology and economic institutions had been transformed. Most of the continent was in process of attaining political independence. From 1820 to 2001, demographic expansion was the most dynamic aspect of Latin American development. Population rose 24–fold, compared to 3–fold in the former metropoles (Spain and Portugal). Per capita performance was less impressive. GDP per head rose 8–fold, compared with 15–fold in the old metropoles and 22–fold in North America. The World Economy: Historical Statistics 492 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006

The striking differences between the growth trajectories of Latin and North America were due in significant degree to differences in the type of colonialism and their enduring impact on institutions and social structure. 

Spain concentrated its colonial activity in Mexico and Peru, which were the most densely populated at the time of conquest. The Aztec and Inca elites and their priesthood were exterminated. Old gods, calendars, records, relics, property rights and indigenous institutions disappeared. Churches and convents were built on the ruins of Aztec and Inca temples. The main agents of social control were the religious orders. Land was allocated to a privileged elite of Spaniards, giving them control of a traumatised Indian population, which was compelled to supply labour to mines and agriculture. There were rigid social distinctions between the ruling elite and the indigenous population which had no legal rights, access to education or land. The main aim of this tribute imperialism was to transfer a fiscal surplus (in precious metals) to finance government aspirations in Europe. Spain was well prepared to exercise this type of hegemony. It had several centuries of experience in reconquest of territory from the Moors. It had the military know–how and organisation for conquest, and a church experienced in evangelising, converting and indoctrinating a conquered population. Islam and Judaism were proscribed in Spain, just as the Aztec and Inca religions were extirpated in Mexico and Peru. The church was firmly under national control; the king being free to appoint bishops under a sixteenth century treaty with the Papacy. Centuries of militant struggle had concentrated power and legitimacy on the monarchy as the ultimate arbiter, against which rebellion even in very distant colonies was seldom imagined before the last quarter of the eighteenth century. By 1825, the American empire had collapsed and more than 14 million people were no longer Spanish. In 1790, it had covered 16 million square km. Cuba and Puerto Rico were all that was left– with an area of 12 thousand square km, and a population less than 700 000. In South America, nine new nations had emerged with a total area of 8.8 million square km. Mexico had an area of 4.4 million square km. Five countries in Central America had formed a temporary union. Independence was achieved by armed struggle, and the process of state–formation was not smooth. The new states inherited the deep inequalities of the colonial period. In Mexico there were five decades of political anarchy after independence, half the land area was lost to the United States, and per capita income was a good deal lower in 1870 than in 1820. This was not untypical of what happened elsewhere. 

Portugal had much more pragmatic objectives in Brazil, developing an export agriculture based on sugar plantations, with much looser imperial control. As indigenous labour was scarce, its labour force was composed largely of African slaves. Between 1500 and 1870, 3.6 million were shipped to Brazil. At the end of the colonial period, half the population were slaves. They were worked to death after a few years of service, and fed on a crude diet of beans and jerked beef. A privileged fraction of the white population enjoyed high incomes but the rest of the population (indigenous, free blacks, mulattos, and large numbers of whites) were poor. Land–ownership was concentrated on slave owners. A very unequal distribution of property buttressed a highly unequal distribution of income. Independence came very smoothly by Latin American standards. In 1808, the Portuguese Queen and the Regent fled to Rio to escape the French invasion of the motherland. They brought 10 000 of the mainland establishment with them. After the Napoleonic wars, Brazil became independent with an Emperor who was the son of the Portuguese monarch. Brazil abolished slavery and became a republic in 1889. 

The Netherlands, the United Kingdom and France copied the Portuguese model in Caribbean islands they seized from Spain in the seventeenth century. These colonies were highly specialised in sugar production, importing most of their food. By 1820, they had imported 3.7 million African slaves. Output rose tenfold between the 1660s and the 1780. A large part of the profits were siphoned off to absentee owners who preferred the healthier climate of the metropoles. The loss of privileged export markets in North America after 1776, interruptions to trade during the Napoleonic wars, and the successful slave revolt in Haiti persuaded the planting lobby that their days were numbered and that it was in their interest to settle for compensation. The prohibition of the slave trade and subsequent abolition of slavery raised costs and weakened the competitive position of most Caribbean producers Latin America 495 

(in spite of the introduction of 700 000 indentured Asian workers between 1838 and 1913). In 1787 the Caribbean accounted for 90 per cent of world sugar exports; in 1913 about a sixth. Except for Cuba and Puerto Rico, the Caribbean became an economic backwater. Real GDP per head fell by a quarter in Jamaica between 1832 and 1870, exports fell from 41 to 15 per cent of GDP. In 1930, the per capita GDP level was about the same as in 1832. For the British and French islands, this experience was probably fairly typical.

Population: The size of the indigenous population at the time of the Spanish conquest was a matter of considerable controversy, and there were two extreme schools of thought. Borah and Cook (1963) estimated 25 million for central Mexico on the basis of ambiguous pictographs describing the incidence of Aztec fiscal levies. They assumed a 95 per cent depopulation ratio for the indigenous population for 1519–1605, and backcast Spanish estimates for 1605 by a multiplier of 25. Rosenblat (1945) made a careful survey of literary evidence, and estimated the pre–conquest population to have been 4.5 million with a drop of less than 15 per cent in the sixteenth century. There are two reasons for scepticism about the Borah estimates for Mexico and Latin America as a whole: a) they assume very much higher disease mortality than European experience with the Black Death; b) they assume that population did not recover its alleged pre–conquest levels until the twentieth century. On the other hand, Rosenblat’s depopulation ratio is clearly too low. There is a discussion of the subsequent literature and rationale for the estimates I adopted in Maddison (2001), pp. 232–236. 

GDP: I made a multicultural estimate, with a stylised per capita GDP for the indigenous population ($400 international 1990 dollars for the hunter–gatherers and $425 for Mexico and Peru, which had developed agriculture and urbanisation). For the non–indigenous population, I assumed the 1820 level of per capita GDP was valid for the whole period 1500–1820. The income level for each group was assumed to be stable, but the average for the two combined was lower in earlier years when the non– indigenous proportion was smaller — see Maddison (2001), p. 250. For the Caribbean, the estimates for 1600–1820 were based largely on evidence about sugar production, inferences on per capita GDP levels at the end of the period from G.

Jamaica is the only Caribbean economy for which GDP estimates are available for this period. Eisner’s estimates imply a 24 per cent fall in per capita GDP between 1820 and 1870 as Jamaica’s sugar economy decayed. I assumed that the 1820–70 per capita GDP movement in this group paralleled that in Jamaica. For the benchmark years 1870, 1913 and 1950, average per capita GDP movement in these economies was assumed parallel to the average for the 8 core countries.

Perez Lopez (1987), Measuring Cuban Economic Performance, University of Texas Press, Austin, p. 111 who recalculated Cuban GDP according to SNA concepts. The Cuban Statistical Office published estimates of GDP by industry of origin for 1975–2000 (see Oficina Nacional de Estadisticas, Cuba: Indicadores Seleccionados, 1950–2000, Havana, 2001, pp. 15–16. Where these estimates overlap with those of Perez Lopez (for 1975–82) they show a growth rate twice as fast. I used these official estimates for 1982–90, but scaled down the year–to–year growth by a coefficient of the differential between them and those of Perez Lopez for the overlap years. 1990– 1998 from ECLAC, Economic Survey of Latin America and the Caribbean: Current Conditions and Outlook (2001); 1998–2001 ECLAC, Preliminary Overview of the Economies of Latin America and the Caribbean, Santiago (2002). These ECLAC figures are based on official Cuban sources which now seem more acceptable as the estimating procedure has been revised to conform with the UN standardised system (see Anuario Estadistico de Cuba 2001, Oficina Nacional de Estadisticas, Havana, 2002).

# HS–5: Asia 

Estimates for Asia are shown in three groups. The first consists of 16 East Asian countries which produced 88 per cent of Asian GDP and had 89 per cent of Asian population in 2001. For these countries the GDP estimates are well documented and of reasonable quality for 1950 onwards and scholars have been active in developing historical accounts for earlier years. There have been major problems for China where official estimates of GDP exaggerate growth and understate its level. Maddison (1998), 

Chinese Economic Performance in the Long Run , OECD, Paris, provides a detailed examination of these problems and makes adjustments to provide a close approximation to Western SNA accounting practice. Chinese official statisticians adopted SNA norms several years ago. Misstatement is not deliberate, but is a transitional problem in moving away from a detailed reporting practice inherited from the long period in which the norms of the Soviet material product system (MPS) prevailed. The second group consists of 26 East Asian countries, which produced 1.6 per cent of Asian GDP and had 4.3 per cent of Asian population in 2001. The third group consists of 15 West Asian countries, which produced about 10 per cent of Asian GDP and had 6.5 per cent of Asian population in 2001. The biggest countries in this group, in terms of GDP are Turkey, Iran, and Saudi Arabia. Eight independent Asian countries emerged from the collapse of the former Soviet Union in 1991, and a third of the GDP of the Russian Federation is generated in Asia. It is not possible to construct satisfactory GDP estimates for this area before 1973, because the problem of disaggregating the former USSR is compounded by the difficulty of converting from an MPS to an SNA basis. Estimates for 1973–2001 are shown in HS–3. Inclusion of the 8 new states would have added 1.9 per cent to our Asian GDP for 2001.

Population: 1820–1949 as in Maddison (2001) and Maddison (1995), except as specified below. 1950 onwards revised and updated from International Programs Center, US Bureau of the Census (October 2002), except for China, India and Indonesia where estimates were derived from sources specified below. 

GDP: 1820–1993 movement from Maddison (2001) revised and updated to 2001 from IMF, 

World Economic Outlook, April 2002, except as specified below. Benchmark 1990 levels in international Geary–Khamis dollars were derived as shown in Maddison (2001), pp. 174, 219–20. 

China: Population and GDP 1820–1998 from Maddison (1998), pp. 155–9, 167–170. 1933 GDP level from Maddison (1998), p. 158, and annual volume movement 1929–38 from Maddison (1995), p. 158. Updating to 2001 from China Statistical Yearbook, Beijing, (2001) with adjustment of growth rate to conform to SNA measurement procedure as indicated in Maddison (2001), p. 202, and described in detail in Maddison (1998). Unfortunately the IMF and many journalists continue to cite the official growth rates or levels without caveat or correction. One also finds frequent references to Japan being The World Economy: Historical Statistics 530 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

the world’s second biggest economy. My estimates show a GDP growth rate for China about threequarters the official estimate and a GDP level about 70 per cent higher than in Japan (when converted by purchasing power parity rather than exchange rates). See Xu Xianchun, Ye Yanfei and Derek Blades (2000), National Accounts for China: Sources and Methods, OECD, Paris and Maddison (1998). 

India: 1900–1990 real GDP and population from Siva Sivasubramonian, The National Income of India in the Twentieth Century, Oxford University Press, Delhi, 2000, updated from his posthumous work, The Sources of Economic Growth in India, 1950 to 1999, OUP, Delhi, forthcoming. GDP movement 1820–1900 from Maddison 2001, pp. 202–3, annual movement 1884–99 from Alan Heston, in Kumar and Desai, eds., Cambridge Economic History of India, vol. 2, 1983, pp. 397–8. The present estimates refer to undivided India until 1946, and to the Indian Union since 1947. The GDP and population estimates are centred on October 1st (the middle of the fiscal year). The following table shows the population breakdown for India, Bangladesh and Pakistan for 1820–1946. Population figures for 1932–46 were misplaced in Maddison (2001), p. 203 and have been corrected. Per capita GDP in 1946 in undivided India was 622 in 1990 Geary–Khamis dollars, 624 in the Indian Union, 566 in Bangladesh, and 672 in Pakistan. Table 5-1.

> Source: 1910-44 total from Suh (1978), p. 41,linked to 1820-1910 population movement from Kwon and Shin (1977), p. 328. The latter estimates are an upward adjustment of the old household registers. Suh used the population censuses which began in 1925, as the basis of his estimates. For the overlap year, 1910, Kwon and Shin show a higher level than Suh. I assume that their upward adjustment was too big, but this should not affect their 1820-1910 growth rate.

Sri Lanka: New annual estimates of population, 1820–1949, and GDP, 1820–1990, were supplied by Pierre van der Eng. His GDP estimates are by industry of origin for 11 major sectors, with considerable commodity detail for agriculture. He draws to some extent on the statistical appendix in D.R. Snodgrass, 

Ceylon: An Export Economy in Transition, Irwin, Illinois, 1966, and on N.K. Sarkar, The Demography of Ceylon, Colombo, 1957, but there is substantial new research, significant revision, and a much more complete annual coverage.

For 1913, there were two gaps. I assumed the 1913–50 per capita GDP movement in Hong Kong was parallel to that in Singapore; in Nepal parallel to India. For 1870, there were eight gaps. For Hong Kong and Singapore I assumed 1870–1913 per capita GDP movement was proportionately the same as in Japan. For the other six countries (Burma, South Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines and Taiwan), per capita GDP was assumed to move parallel to the average 1870–1913 for Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Thailand. For 1820, there were nine gaps. Per capita GDP in Korea was taken to be the same as in China. Per capita GDP in Burma and Nepal was assumed to have been stagnant between 1820 and 1870 as it was in India. Average per capita GDP movement for the other six countries was assumed to be parallel to that in Japan. For 1820, the proxy estimates represented 3.8 per cent of the total GDP of the 16 countries, 4 per cent in 1870, and 0.6 per cent in 1913. In the basic tables the proxy entries are shown in italics.

Conjectures to Fill Gaps in the Estimates: There are no gaps for population for benchmark years 1820, 1870 and 1913, but several countries for which GDP estimates are not available. As the objective is to provide a picture for the world as a whole, it was necessary to fill gaps in the dataset by conjectures (see Table 5–3).

For 1820–1913, provisional estimates of Vietnamese GDP volume movement were supplied by Jean–Pascal Bassino; North Korea was assumed to have the same per capita GDP as South Korea. For other countries no GDP estimates were available. I assumed the average per capita GDP, 1820– 1913, for the whole group was the same as the average for North Korea and Vietnam (see Table 5–5). Population levels from McEvedy and Jones (1978), except for Vietnam, where I used Maks Banens’ provisional estimate for 1913, with 1820–1913 population movement from McEvedy and Jones.

Before the First World War, most of this area was part the Ottoman Empire. It accounted for 28 million of the 1913 population. The other 11 million lived in Iran. The 1820, 1870 and 1913 population figures shown in Table 5–6 are from Colin McEvedy and Richard Jones, Atlas of World Population History, Penguin (1978), pp. 133–154. Sevket Pamuk has recently made tentative estimates of per capita GDP for several countries which permit estimates for the region much better than those in Maddison (2001), pp. 210–215. See Pamuk, “Economic Growth in Southeastern Europe and the Middle East since 1820”, European Historical Economics Society Conference, Oxford, September 2001. They were derived from a variety of evidence in Ottoman archives and other research material on the region. He linked them to the Maddison (2001) estimates for later years and used the same numeraire, i.e. 1990 international Geary–Khamis dollars. Table 5–6 contains estimates for three groups of countries in the region. For the countries in Arabia no GDP estimates are available before the second world war. They have now been transformed by the discovery and development of oil resources, but production did not start until the inter–war period. However, in the nineteenth century there was significant income from trade in the Persian Gulf, Southern Arabia and the Red Sea coast. Oman controlled large trading territories on the East African littoral. Yemen was a major exporter of coffee. For this group, I assumed a modest increase in per capita income from $550 to $600 between 1820 and 1913, as world trade expanded. The second group consists of five more prosperous countries (Iraq, Jordan, Palestine, Syria and Lebanon) with an ancient history as sophisticated traders with East Asia, Africa and Europe. Pamuk provides per capita estimates for Syria, which I assumed valid for Lebanon as well. His estimate for Jordan was taken to be valid for Iraq and Iran. I used his estimate for Palestine.

For Turkey see Table 5–7. The GDP benchmark for 1990 is from Maddison (2001), p. 219. GDP volume movement for 1948 onwards from OECD National Accounts, various issues, 1923–48 from T. Bulutay, Y.S. Tezel and N. Yilderim, Turkiye Milli Geliri 1923–48, Ankara, 1974, with 1913 per capita GDP assumed to be the same as in 1929. I linked the 1913 level to the per capita volume movement for 1820–1913 shown in Pamuk (2001). His major source was V. Eldem, Osmanli Imparatorlugunun Iktisadi sartlari Hakkinda Bir Tetkik (A Study of Economic Conditions in the Ottoman Empire), Is Bank, Istanbul, (1970). Population is from McEvedy and Jones (1978).

# HS–6: A FRICA Contours of African Development 

As the long–term economic development of Africa is difficult to quantify with any precision, it is useful to consider the broad contours and salient features I had in mind when making conjectures about the development of per capita income. There is a marked difference between the historical experience of the lands North of the Sahara and the rest of the continent. For most of the past two millennia, there were higher levels of income and urbanisation, more sophisticated economic and political institutions in the North than in the South. North African history is reasonably well documented because there are substantial written records. Knowledge of the South is based on archaeological or linguistic evidence until the ninth century when written evidence of northern visitors becomes available. Over the long run, population growth was much more dynamic South of the Sahara. Two thousand years ago, about half lived in the north; by 1820, four–fifths in the south. Between the first century AD and 1820, the population of the North had increased by a third (with many intervening setbacks). In the South it increased nearly eightfold (see Table 6–1). In terms of extensive growth (i.e. capacity to accommodate population increase), the south clearly had the edge. In terms of per capita real income, it seems likely that the average Northern level was lower in 1820 than in the first century. South of the Sahara, it is probable that it increased modestly (see Table 6–2). The greater demographic dynamism of the south is surprising, because of its substantial losses from the slave trade. There seem to be three reasons for this: a) in Egypt and the Maghreb, plague seems to have been endemic from the sixth to the early nineteenth century. It does not seem to have crossed the Sahara; b) before the eighth century, there was virtually no contact between North and South. Possibilities for trade across the Sahara were revolutionised by the introduction of camels between the fifth and eighth centuries. They could carry about a third of a ton of freight, go without food for several days, and without water for up to 15 days. The growth in trade benefitted both parties. The partial Islamisation of black Africa increased the sophistication and organisational ability of the ruling elites in the Sahel and savannah lands of West Africa south of the Sahara; c) probably the most important was the spread of improved agricultural technology and new crops. Two thousand years ago, much of black Africa was inhabited by hunter–gatherers using stone–age technology. By 1820, they had been pushed aside and were a fraction of the population. The proportion of agriculturalists and pastoralists with iron–age tools and weapons increased dramatically. Land productivity was also helped by the introduction and gradual diffusion of maize, cassava and sweet potatoes from the Americas from 1500 onwards. 

Egypt 

In the first century AD, all of North Africa was under Roman rule. The Mediterranean was a Roman lake with magnificent ports in Italy and Alexandria and substantial flows of trade between Africa, Europe and the Middle East. Egypt was the most prosperous area, with a relatively large urban population, a sedentary agriculture, a substantially monetised economy, a significant industrial and The World Economy: Historical Statistics 570 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

commercial sector, and a very long history as an organised state. Its natural waterways lowered the cost of transporting freight and passengers through its most densely populated area. As the prevailing winds blew from the North, one could sail upstream and float downstream. Agricultural productivity was high because of the abundant and reliable flow of Nile water and the annual renewal of topsoil in the form of silt. Egypt produced a surplus that the Pharoahs and the Ptolemies used to support a brilliant civilisation. From the first to the tenth century, it was siphoned off; first to Rome, then to Constantinople. After the Muslim conquest, it was redirected by the authorities in Damascus then Baghdad. Under the Fatimid, Ayyubid and Mamluk regimes, tribute ceased, but in 1516 Egypt became a provincial backwater under a Turkish viceroy, paying tribute to the Ottoman sultan. Foreign rule generally impeded trade through the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean which had flourished in the first and second centuries, and was restored from the tenth to the fifteenth century. Virtually all trade with Europe disappeared from the fourth until the twelfth century. The entrepot trade, manufactured exports and population of Alexandria withered away. Table 6-1.

By 1820, the Egyptian population was below its level in the eleventh century and the same is likely to have been true for per capita income. In the same period, Western Europe trebled its per capita income and increased its population more than fivefold. 

The Maghreb 

In West Africa, Roman ships did not venture beyond Cape Bojador (just south of the Canary Islands), because the prevailing winds made it impossible for them to make the return journey. Overland trade between the western provinces of Africa and the lands to the south was negligible. Roman settlement was essentially coastal except in Tunisia where large irrigated estates were worked mainly by tenant farmers. Exports from these provinces were heavily concentrated on grain shipped to Italy from Carthage and olive oil from Tripolitania. Roman economic activity in Morocco was vestigial. Table 6-2.

Source: The stylised conjectures are for per capita income in each of the five regions at different points of time; GDP is derivative (i.e. per capita conjectures are multiplied by population estimates in Table 6-1). The rationale for the conjectures is derived from the analysis of main currents in African history in the following text. In the first century AD, North Africa belonged to the Roman Empire. Egypt was the richest part of the Roman world because of the special character of its agriculture, which had yielded a large surplus for governance and monuments in Pharaonic times, and was generally siphoned off as tribute by Roman and Arab rulers. Libya and most of the Maghreb (except Morocco) had a prosperous and urbanised coastal fringe in Roman times, with Berber tribes between them and the Sahara. There was no contact then with black Africa which I assume had an average income only slightly above subsistence ($400 in my numeraire ). After the Arab conquest of North Africa in the seventh century, camel transport permitted trade across the Sahara, permitting a rise in per capita income in Morocco, the Sahel and West Africa. I assume that the gradual transition within Black Africa from a hunter-gatherer to an agricultural mode of production permitted greatly increased density of settlement with higher per capita labour inputs, but had little impact on per capita income.

When the Arabs conquered the Maghreb they severed the Mediterranean trading links which had previously existed and explored new opportunities across the desert. They established camel caravan routes from Tunisia and Libya deep into the Sahara to places where it was possible to trade horses for black slaves. Bigger profits could be derived from the gold trade with ancient Ghana (about 800 kilometres north–west of modern Ghana, between the Senegal and Niger rivers, just inside the southern boundary of modern Mauretania), which had a lengthy history as state before the Arabs established contact in the early eighth century. The most direct route was through Morocco, the area which received the greatest stimulus from the new contacts with black Africa. Muslim merchants on these new routes were active in making converts to Islam. Early in the eleventh century, ancient Ghana was the first of the black African states to convert to Islam. Gold production increased steadily in West Africa from the eighth century onwards. Until the twelfth century most of the output circulated within the Muslim world, but from then onwards there was increasing demand from Europe, mainly from Genoa, Venice, Pisa, Florence and Marseilles. European traders conducted their operations in Muslim ports on the Mediterranean coast. They had only minimal contact with African gold producing areas until the second half of the fifteenth century when Portugal gained access to the West African coast. From the eighth to the twelfth century, the main market for Muslim traders was Awdaghast in Ghana. The goldfield was at Bambuk, somewhat further south, but its exact whereabouts was kept secret. Most exports were in the form of gold dust which was melted and moulded into ingots. In the fourteenth century, pressure of demand was such that production was started further south at the Akan mines (in present–day Ghana). In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries the main trading centre for gold was Timbuktu in the empire of Songhay. Mining wealth was the main reason why ancient Ghana, Mali and Songhay were able to emerge as powerful states. Income from gold produced an economic surplus which allowed the rulers to maintain the attributes of power. It made it possible for them to import horses and weapons and maintain cavalry forces. The main barter transactions between the Maghreb and black Africa were exchange of salt for gold. In the Sahel region, salt was very scarce, but was a necessity for people doing heavy work. Some of the salt came from maritime sources on the Atlantic coast. But it was much easier to transport rock salt. From the eleventh to the sixteenth century, the main source was in the Sahara at Taghaza, where it was mined by slave labour, cut into large blocks, and transported south by camel. Salt was not the only trade item in this north–south trade. There was also a lively exchange between trading centres within the Sahel and West Africa, particularly in kola nuts — the African equivalent of coffee or tobacco. Further east, Kanem was the main centre of the slave trade. At a later stage there was a diversity of gold routes to Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Egypt and from Mediterranean ports to European customers. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, Muslim countries were the only ones to mint gold coins. Marseilles first issued them in 1227, Florence in 1252, and Venice in 1284. 

Black Africa 

In spite of the advance beyond hunter–gatherer techniques, the agriculture of black Africa contrasted sharply with that of Egypt. There was an abundance of land in relation to population, but soils were poor, and were not regenerated by manure, crop rotation, natural or human provision of irrigation. As a consequence, there was an extensive, shifting cultivation, with land being left fallow for a decade or more after the first crops. Nomadic pastoralists were generally transhumant over wide areas for the same reason — poor soils. The main agricultural implements were digging sticks, iron hoes for tillage, axes and machetes for clearing trees and bush. There were no ploughs (except in Ethiopia) and virtually no use of traction animals in agriculture. There were no wheeled vehicles, no water mills, windmills or other instruments of water management. Africa 573 

There were no individual property rights in land. Tribes, kin–groups or other communities had customary rights to farm or graze in the areas where they lived, but collective property rights and boundaries were vague. Chiefs and rulers did not collect rents, land taxes, or feudal levies. Their main instrument of exploitation was slavery. Slaves were generally acquired by raids on neighbouring groups. Hence there was a substantial beggar–your–neighbour element in inter–group relations. It is not clear how widespread slavery was before contact with Muslim Africa, but the contact certainly reinforced the institution because it made it possible to derive a substantial income from export of slaves across the Sahara. The traffic was organised by Muslim traders from the North. The flow from north to south was negligible. Slaves usually walked through the desert with a caravan of camels carrying food, water, slave drivers and other passengers. Transport facilities in black Africa were poor. Camels thrived in the dry heat of the desert but could not function further south. Muslim Africa had ships which could navigate and trade in the Mediterranean, and in Egypt there was substantial and relatively safe travel on the sailing boats of the Nile. In the Sahel and West Africa, there were partially navigable rivers, particularly the Niger, the Senegal and Gambia, but river traffic moved in rather primitive paddle–boats made of hollowed–out tree trunks and the frequency of cataracts meant that merchandise frequently had to be trans–shipped by head porterage. Horses were very expensive and had a short life expectation, because of the climate and the fact that they were highly sensitive to tsetse flies. They were used almost exclusively for military and prestige purposes by the ruling groups and their lightly armed cavalry (horses and riders wore padded armour as a defence against arrows). A striking feature of black Africa before contact with the Islamic world, was universal illiteracy and absence of written languages (except in Ethiopia). This made it difficult to transmit knowledge across generations and between African societies. Contact with Islam brought obvious advantages. The Arabs who came as traders had a written language, and an evangelising bent. They included sophisticated members of the Muslim intelligentsia ( ulama ), who were able to promote knowledge of property institutions, law, and techniques of governance as well cutting business deals. Before the Moroccan conquest of Songhay in 1591, Muslim visitors were generally peaceful and posed no threat to African chiefs and rulers. They saw clear advantages in Islamisation which helped them build bigger empires and acquire stronger instruments of coercion. They were able to exchange gold and slaves for horses and weapons (steel sword blades and tips for spears, and, at a later stage, guns and gunpowder). Black African traders also saw the advantages of conversion. As converts ( dyulas ) they became members of an œcumene with free access to markets well beyond their previous horizons. Thus there was a gradual spread of hybrid Islam in black Africa from the eleventh century onwards. Conversion had its main effect on the ruling groups whose insignia and sanctions of power were a mix of Islam and tradition, whilst most of their subjects continued to be animists. Analysts of state formation in black Africa make a distinction between complex and acephalous groups (see Goody, 1971). There were a great variety of polities within black Africa. The differentiation grew wider as a result of the varying degree of contact with Islam. Slave traders were generally the most Islamised. Slaves tended to be taken from the acephalous, stateless, and least Islamised groups. There were two reasons for this. The Muslim states tended to have the most powerful armed forces, and they generally avoided enslaving Muslims. 

The European Encounter with Africa 

Between the eleventh and the fourteenth centuries, European contact with Africa took place in the Mediterranean. European merchants were able to buy Asian spices in Alexandria and African gold on the Tunisian coast until the Ottomans captured Egypt and most of North Africa early in the sixteenth century.

Portugal attacked Morocco in 1415 with intent to conquer and get access to African gold. It captured Ceuta, and, by 1521, established several bases on its Atlantic coast, but Moroccan forces recaptured these in 1541 and in 1578 annihilated a Portuguese invasion force. However, Portuguese innovations in the design of ships and navigational instruments made it possible to circumnavigate Africa and trade directly with India and other Asian destinations from 1497 onwards.

Curtin’s total for 1500-1870 is 9.4 million compared to more than 11 here. Part of the difference is that Curtin shows arrivals whereas Lovejoy does not allow for deaths in transit. The difference is also due to Lovejoy’s use of the Du Bois archive in Harvard.

They created a trading base at Arquim on the Mauretanian coast in 1445, where they exchanged cloth, horses, trinkets and salt for gold. In 1482, a strongly fortified base was created at Elmina, on the coast of present day Ghana, which gave better access to the Ashanti gold mines. They succeeded in diverting a substantial part of West African gold exports from the Maghreb (see Table 6–4), and got smaller amounts in East Africa from Mutapa in Northern Zimbabwe. The Portuguese discovered quickly that the disease environment in sub–Saharan Africa was very hostile to European settlement. It was, in fact, the reverse of the situation in the Americas. Europeans had very high mortality from African diseases, but Africans were not particularly susceptible to European diseases. Portugal created an island settlement at São Tomé (in the Bight of Guinea), where sugar production was developed with slave labour. Portuguese also acted as intermediaries in the slave trade, buying and selling between African coastal markets. With the discovery of the Americas, it became more profitable and healthier for Europeans to expand sugar production in Brazil than in Africa. Portugal became the major slave–trader across the Atlantic. Although the Portuguese pioneered the export of African slaves for plantation agriculture in the Americas, they did not invent African slavery. Between 650 and 1500, 6.5 million slaves had been shipped from black Africa across the Sahara; to Arabia, the Persian Gulf, and India (see Table 6–5). However the Atlantic trade led to a massive increase in enslavement. In the course of the seventeenth century, Portuguese slaving activity in Africa met fierce competition from the Dutch, British and French. The British exported more than 2.5 million slaves; most of them from Sierra Leone and the Guinea coast. The French took 1.2 million from the Senegal–Gambia region and the Dutch about half a million, mainly from the Gold Coast. The Portuguese were driven out of these regions and concentrated on shipments from Angola to Brazil and Spanish America. Their total shipments from 1500 to 1870 were about 4.5 million. In the majority of cases, African traders controlled the slaves until the moment of sale. They brought them to the coast or the riverbanks where they were sold to European traders. Within Africa, slaves were acquired in several ways. Some were the offspring of slaves. A large proportion were captured in wars or were supplied as tribute by subject or dependent tribes. Criminals of various kinds were a steady source. There was large–scale raiding of poorly armed tribes without strong central authorities, and kidnapping of individual victims. The flow across the Atlantic rose from an average of 9 000 a year in 1662–80 to a peak of 76 000 in 1760–89. Lovejoy shows the average price per slave in constant (1601) prices for 1663–1775. In 1663–82, the average price was £2.9 and £15.4 in 1733–75. African income from slavery therefore appears to have risen more than 40–fold from the end of the seventeenth to the end of the eighteenth century. At their peak, in the late eighteenth century, H.S. Klein (1999), The Atlantic Slave Trade, CUP, p. 125, suggests that it probably represented less than 5 per cent of West African income. The demographic losses were concentrated on tribes and people who were least able to protect themselves. Population growth in black Africa was certainly reduced by slave exports. Between 1500 and 1820 it grew about 0.16 per cent a year compared with 0.26 in Western Europe and 0.29 in Asia. The disruption caused by slavery reduced income in the areas from which slaves were seized. The trade goods which slave exporters received in exchange raised consumption but had little impact on production potential. In the eighteenth century, they included Indian textiles made specially for the West African market, tobacco and alcohol, jewellery, bar iron, weapons, gunpowder and cowrie shells from the Maldives. Slavery within black Africa rose substantially after the abolition movement reduced the Atlantic flow and the price of slaves dropped. The momentum of enslavement continued, and a much larger proportion of the captives were absorbed within Africa. Lovejoy (2000), pp. 191–210 estimates that, at the end of the nineteenth century, 30–50 per cent of the population of the western, central and Nilotic Sudan were slaves. In the 1850s half the people in the caliphate of Sokoto in northern Nigeria were The World Economy: Historical Statistics 576 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

slaves. In Zanzibar, the slave population rose from 15 000 in 1818 to 100 000 in the 1860s. There was a large increase of slave employment in peasant and plantation agriculture producing palm oil products, peanuts, cloves and cotton for export. In the Belgian Congo, Southeast and South Africa there was a rapid expansion of mining activity at the end of the century, with a servile labour force, whose de facto 

situation was equivalent to slavery. An important result of Portuguese contact with black Africa was the introduction of crops from the Americas. The most important for the food supply and capacity to expand population were roots and tubers. Cassava (manioc) was brought from Brazil to the Congo, the Niger delta and the Bight of Benin early in the sixteenth century. It had high yields, was rich in starch, calcium, iron and vitamin C. It was a perennial plant, tolerant of a wide variety of soils, invulnerable to locusts, drought resistant and easy to cultivate. It could be left in reserve, unharvested, for long periods in good condition after ripening. Cassava flour could be made into cakes for long distance travel and was a staple food for slaves in transit across the Atlantic. Maize was an American crop which the Portuguese introduced on the west and east African coasts. By the seventeenth century it was present in Senegal, the Congo basin, South Africa and Zanzibar. Sweet potatoes were another significant addition to Africa’s food supply. Over the centuries these crops were widely diffused. In the mid–1960s, threequarters (43 million tons) of African output of roots and tubers came from cassava and sweet potatoes (see FAO, Production Yearbook, 1966). Maize (15 million tons) represented a third of black Africa’s cereal output, the traditional millet and sorghum 47 per cent, rice 12 per cent and other cereals 8 per cent. Other significant American plants which were important in the long term were beans, peanuts, tobacco and cocoa. Bananas and plantains were Asian crops widely diffused in East Africa before the Portuguese arrived; coffee, tea, rubber and cloves were later introductions from Asia. European countries did nothing to transmit technical knowledge to Africa, nor did they attempt to promote education, printing, development of alphabets etc. China had printing in the ninth century, Western Europe from 1453, Mexico in 1539, Peru 1584, and the north American colonies from the beginning of the seventeenth century. The first printing press in Africa was established in Cairo in 1822. In 1820, there were only 50 thousand people of European descent in Africa (half of them at the Cape), compared to 13.4 million in the Americas. Africa had diseases which caused very high rates of mortality to Europeans, though Africans were not particularly susceptible to European diseases. Africans had much better weapons to defend themselves than the indigenous population of the Americas. The situation changed in the nineteenth century. Due to improvements in European weaponry, transport (steamboats and railways) and medicine (quinine), the number of European origin in Africa rose to 2.5 million in 1913. We should note some African institutions which hindered development, but were not due to European influence. One of these, on which Ibn Khaldun commented at length, was the fragility of the states which emerged in the Muslim world (a point which applies a fortiori to black Africa). He demonstrated the persistence of tribal affiliations and lineages, and the continuence of nomadic traditions destructive of attempts to develop sedentary agriculture and urban civilisation. He stressed the cyclical rise and fall of Muslim regimes and saw no measure of progress from the seventh to the fourteenth century in which he lived. African societies failed to secure property rights. The power elite were autocratic and predatory, which inhibited accumulation of capital and willingness to take business risks. This was very obvious in the Mamluk regime in Egypt. There were few countervailing forces in African societies. Goitein’s (1967–93) detailed scrutiny of the Cairo Geniza archive led him to be very upbeat about the emergence of a commercial business class in Fatimid Egypt, but freedom of enterprise was snuffed out in later dynasties. The most striking example of deficient property rights was slavery itself, which was closely linked with the polgygamous family structure and limitation on the rights of women. These two institutions were probably the major impediment to physical and human capital formation. Africa 577 

Evidence and Conjectures on the Pace of Development, 1820–1950 

Six Country Sample: Maddison (2001) contained pre–1950 estimates for Egypt, Ghana, Morocco and South Africa. I have added Algeria and Tunisia, and extended the estimates for Egypt and Ghana. Sources for the sample countries were as follows:

The last column of Table 6–6 compares my results with the proxy estimates of Tarik Yousef (2002), “Egypt’s Growth Performance under Economic Liberalism: A Reassessment with New GDP Estimates, 1886–1945”, Review of Income and Wealth, 48/4 December, pp. 561–79. He derives nominal GDP by a regression procedure using the money supply and assumed velocity of its circulation. He deflates it with a price index and divides by population. I show his per capita GDP movement linked to my estimate of the 1945 level. Yousef cites a miscellany of sources (including those I have used) to show that the broad contours of his proxy estimates are congruent with direct estimates for the first half of the twentieth century. However, there is a big discrepancy between his 1886–1913 per capita movement and mine. His 1886/7 level seems implausibly low, given the substantial expansion in agricultural output, exports and infrastructure investment between 1820 and the 1880s (which he acknowledges at the beginning of his article).

I linked his GDP volume movement to my estimate of the 1955 level in 1990 international dollars; 1870 per capita GDP derived by logarithmic interpolation between his 1880 estimate and my conjecture for 1820, 1913 by interpolation between his figures for 1910 and 1920.

Ghana: R.

Table 6–8 links his GDP movement to the 1960 level in 1990 international dollars. 1913 GDP is an extrapolation of his 1901–11 sector growth rates; the 1870 per capita level an interpolation between 1891 and my conjecture for 1820.

Szereszewski distinguished between the traditional and modern sectors. He assumed the traditional sector expanded in line with population from 1891–1911 and rose about half in per capita terms from 1911 to 1960. The new components rose nearly 8 per cent a year in the two decades he scrutinised in detail. Cocoa exports rose from 80 lbs. in 1891 to 89 million in 1911, when 600 thousand acres and 185 thousand man–years were absorbed in its production. To a large degree the cocoa boom was sustained by more intensive use of land and previously underemployed rural labour. Table 6.7.

The second dynamic element was gold. It had been exported for centuries, and in the 1870s there was a beginning of modern operations. The discovery of huge reserves in South Africa in 1886 sparked an analogous euphoria and investment boom in Ghana. By 1901, 42 companies were operating, and by 1911, a railway connection had been built from the coast to Kumasi through the gold mining areas. There were also improvements in transport facilities from Accra to its cocoa– growing hinterland, investment in modern port facilities in Secondi and Accra, and development of internal river transport by steam launches. The export ratio rose from 8 to 19 per cent of GDP between 1891 and 1911. The main benefits of growth were felt by the locals. In 1911 there were 2 245 Europeans (about 0.1 per cent of the population). In Algeria at that time there were three–quarters of a million European settlers (about 14 per cent of the total). 

South Africa: GDP movement 1912–20 from Bureau of Census and Statistics, Union Statistics for Fifty Years, Pretoria, 1960; 1920–50 from L.J. Fourie, “Contribution of Factors of Production and Productivity to South African Economic Growth” IARIW, processed, 1971. 1870 per capita GDP level was derived by interpolation of the direct estimate for 1913 and my conjecture for 1820. Although direct GDP estimates are not available, it seems clear that South Africa was the most dynamic of the sample countries from 1820 to 1913. The chief beneficiaries were white settlers. In 1820 they were 30 000 (2 per cent of the population) displacing relatively weak and thinly settled indigenous herdsmen and hunters (Khoisan) in the Cape settlement which was then mainly a staging post for trade with Asia. By 1870 there were quarter of a million whites who had fanned out East and North into Natal, the Orange Free State and Transvaal, taken the best land and water supplies from Xhosa, Zulu and other indigenous groups and exploited various forms of semi–servile labour. In the next twenty years the discovery of diamonds and gold created a boom in investment and immigration. By 1913, there were 1.3 million whites (22 per cent of the population), with an elaborate system of social segregation to buttress their privileged position. Table 6–9 on the expansion of the rail network per head of population provides a clue to the comparative dynamics of African development. Table 6-9.

The top panel of Table 6–10 shows population in the 6 sample countries 1820–2001, the total for the non–sample countries and for Africa as a whole. The pace of population growth, 1820–1950, was about twice as fast in the sample as in the other countries, 1.19 per cent a year compared with 0.77 per cent. Average per capita income in the sample countries in 1950 was more than twice the level in the rest of Africa, as can be seen from the bottom panel, and in 2001, it was more than three times as high.

Per capita income was assumed to increase at the same pace in the non–sample as the average for the sample countries between 1913 and 1950. Non–sample per capita GDP in 1870 is an interpolation between the conjecture for 1820 and that for 1913.

Updates for 1950–2001 

Annual estimates for 1950–2001 are an update and revision of those for 1950–1998 in Maddison (2001), pp. 310–327; with detail for another nine countries. Population 1950–2001 is from International Programs Center, US Bureau of the Census, October 2002 (USBC at www.census.gov). GDP volume movement 1950–2001 revised and updated for 1993 onwards from IMF, World Economic Outlook, 

September, 2000. I amalgamated Eritrea and Ethiopia. Eritrea became part of a federation with Ethiopia in 1952. Ten years later it was annexed as a province. It seceded in 1991, and independence was approved in a 1993 referendum. There was a border war 1998–2000. Eritrean population was 6.5 per cent of the total for the two countries in 1950, 6.2 per cent in 2001. 1990 benchmark GDP levels in million 1990 international Geary–Khamis dollars were derived from Penn World Tables version 5.6 in Maddison (2001). Here (see Table 6–11), I have used the new PWT 6.1 (October 2002) and raised the 1990 GDP level for Burkina Faso (from $5 482 to $6 748 million), Burundi (from $3 520 to $3 879), Egypt (from $112 873 to $143 000), Ethiopia and Eritrea (from $18 964 to $29 593), Lesotho (from $1 828 to $2 033), and Zaire from ($17 304 to $19 922).

Source: This table compares three sets of PWT estimates with ICP5 results (which are available for only 22 African countries). Col. 1 from annex to R.S. Summers and A. Heston, “The Penn World Table (Mark 5): An Expanded Set of International Comparisons, 1950– 1988”, Quarterly Journal of Economics, May 1991. Col. 2 from their January 1995 diskette. Col. 3 from Alan Heston, Robert Summers and Bettina Aten, PWT Version 6.1, Center for International Comparisons at the University of Pennsylvania (CICUP), October 2002 (http://pwt.econ.upenn.edu). In some cases PWT 5.6 referred to a year before 1990, and in Maddison (2001) I updated using the volume movement of GDP, and the change in the US GDP deflator between that year and 1990. I also made proxy estimates for Libya, Equatorial Guinea, Mayotte, St. Helena, São Tomé & Principe, and W. Sahara. Although some PWT 6.1 estimates are lower than those of 5.6, the overall result for the 45 countries now available is to raise African GDP by 28 percent. Italics indicate countries where the GDP level has been raised. Other striking cases are a 63 percent rise for South Africa and a 47 percent rise for Algeria. As some of the changes are very large, I prefer to wait until a further PWT round is available before adopting the new African estimates en bloc . I have adopted 6.1 estimates for Burkina Faso, Burundi, Egypt, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Lesotho and Zaire, as PWT 5.6 estimates seemed implausibly low. ICP 5 from UN/Eurostat, World Comparisons of Real GDP and Purchasing Power 1985, New York, 1994, p. 5. adjusted to a 1990 basis.

# HS–7: The World Economy, 1950–2001 

Tables 7a–7c show annual estimates of economic activity in 7 regions and the world for the year 1900, and annually 1950–2001. They aggregate the detailed estimates by country in HS–1 to HS–6 and there are analytical tables showing percentage year–to–year movement in real terms. Three basic ingredients are necessary for these estimates. These are time series on population which we have for 221 countries, time series showing the volume movement in GDP in constant national prices for 179 countries, and purchasing power converters for 99.3 per cent of world GDP in our benchmark year 1990. With these converters we can transform the GDP volume measures into comparable estimates of GDP level across countries for every year between 1950 and 2001. For countries where all three types of measure are available, the estimates of per capita GDP level are derivative. However, to arrive at a comprehensive world total, we need proxy measures of GDP movement for 42 countries, and proxy per capita GDP levels for 48 countries for the year 1990. These proxies collectively represent less than 1 per cent of world output. 

a) World Population Movement 1950–2003 

There are two comprehensive and detailed estimates of world population which are regularly updated and revised. They both provide annual estimates back to 1950 and projections 50 years into the future. No other source provides such comprehensive detail, length of perspective, or causal analysis of birth and death rates, fertility and migration. Here I have used the latest (October 2002) estimates of the US Bureau of the Census (USBC) for all countries except China, India and Indonesia. In Maddison (2001), I used the USBC 1999 version for 178 countries, OECD sources for 20 countries and Soviet sources for 15 countries. USBC estimates are available at http://www.census.gov/ipc. The United Nations Population Division (UNPD) is the alternative. Its latest estimates, World Population Prospects: The 2000 Revision, 

were prepared in February 2001; the previous version was issued in 1998. The UN shows estimates for quinquennial intervals, but annual country detail is available for purchase on a CD ROM. Table 7a shows my estimates, based mainly on USBC. Table 7* shows UNPD figures with the same regional breakdown. The easiest way to compare the two sources is the ratio of the two alternatives shown in Table 7**. On the world level the differences are minimal, and the regional differences are not very large after 1973. On the country level there are larger differences between the two sources. These are biggest for small countries and the UNPD omits Taiwan. Both sources provide a similar long–term view, showing the fastest demographic momentum in Africa and a general reduction in the pace of growth in the 1990s. Differences are mainly due to use of different sources or conjectures for cases where evidence is poor. It is clear from inspection of the country detail that the USBC takes better account of short–term interruptions due to war, flight of population or natural disasters. Their impact is smoothed by UNPD interpolation between census intervals. One example is the genocide and exodus from Rwanda: USBC shows a 25 per cent fall of population in 1993–5, UNPD 9 per cent. USBC shows a 55 per cent fall in Kuwait in 1991 during the Gulf war, UNPD 2 per cent. USBC shows a 70 per cent fall in Montserrat in 1998 due to volcanic activity, UNPD tapers this decline over several years. In fact, a major objective of the UN is to provide alternative projections of population trends which are of fundamental importance in assessing prospects for its development programmes. USBC is probably more interested in monitoring past and present performance. The World Economy: Historical Statistics 606 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006

b) Movement in Volume of GDP 1950–2001 

Table 7–1 shows the coverage of our GDP estimates for five benchmark years since 1820. For 2001 there were direct estimates for 179 countries representing 99.8 per cent of world output with proxies for 42 other countries (mostly very small), for which direct measures were not available (see Tables 1–4, 4–5 and 5–4). Generally speaking the proxies assume per capita GDP movement parallel to the average for other countries in the same region. The total number of countries was bigger in 2001 than 1950, but this was due to the emergence of new states in Eastern Europe and the USSR. The area covered and the degree of reliance on proxies was in fact similar in 1950. Coverage was much more comprehensive than for the nineteenth century.

Measures of GDP volume movement for 1950–2001 are mainly derived from official sources, because of the widespread governmental commitment to their publication, and, from 1953, adherence to the methodology of a standardised system of national accounts (SNA), now endorsed by the EU, IMF, OECD, United Nations, and World Bank (see UN, 1993). Communist countries were an exception. They used the Soviet material product approach (MPS), which exaggerated growth and left out most service activities. Fortunately Kremlinologists (guided by the work of Abram Bergson and Thad Alton) were able to adjust estimates for many of these countries to conform more closely to SNA criteria — see the assessment of their work in Maddison (1995) for Eastern Europe; Maddison (1997) for the USSR; and Maddison (1998) on China. The MPS system has now been abandoned, but there are still residual measurement problems of adjustment to the SNA in the successor countries of the USSR, China, Cuba, North Korea and Vietnam. There are also countries, particularly in Africa, where real GDP estimates are still of low quality, because resources for statistics and trained statisticians are very scarce and in many cases, data collection has been interrupted by war. For OECD countries, a full set of national accounts statistics, with adjustment to secure comparability, has been published regularly since 1954, with annual data for 1938, and for 1947 onwards. For Eastern Europe official estimates are available in publications of the Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), and adjusted figures by the CIA were published regularly for 1950–90 in the proceedings of the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress. The Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) has published detailed national accounts annually since 1950 in its Statistical Yearbook for Latin America , with updates in its monthly ECLAC Notes. East Asian national accounts are published in detail by the Asian Development Bank in its annual Key Indicators. West Asian accounts are published by the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) in its annual National Accounts Studies of the ESCWA Region. Estimates for African countries 1950–90 were derived mainly from the database of the OECD Development Centre whose Latest Information on National Accounts of Developing Countries was published annually from 1969 to 1991. For 1990 onwards, annual GDP movements for virtually all African countries are shown in the IMF Economic Outlook .

c) Derivation of 1990 Benchmark Purchasing Power Converters in order to Permit Cross–country Comparison of GDP Levels and Construction of Regional and World Aggregates 

In order to make cross–country comparison of GDP levels and aggregate estimates of regional or world totals, we need to convert national currencies into a common unit (numeraire). Table 7–2 shows the derivation of the numeraire for measurement of GDP levels in my benchmark year 1990, which is the interspatial–intertemporal anchor for my comprehensive world estimates. The 1990 cross–section level estimates are merged with the time series for real GDP growth to show GDP levels for all other years. There are four options for deriving GDP converters: 

i) Exchange Rates: Conversion of nominal estimates by exchange rates is the simplest option, but exchange rates are mainly a reflection of purchasing power over tradeable items. They may also move erratically because of speculative capital movements or surges of inflation. In poor countries where wages are low, non–tradeable services, like haircuts, government services, building construction, are generally cheaper than in high–income countries, so there is a general tendency for exchange rates to understate purchasing power of their currencies. China is an extreme case. Mr Patten, the last British governor of Hong Kong, stated in an article in the Economist newspaper of 4 January 1997 that “Britain’s GDP today is almost twice the size of China’s”. This was an exchange rate comparison. PPP conversion shows British GDP to have been less than a third of China’s in 1997. There are very strong reasons for preferring PPP converters which are now available for most of the world economy. Correction for the The World Economy: Historical Statistics 608 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

wide disparity in price levels between countries is a logical interspatial corollary to the use of national GDP deflators to correct for intertemporal changes in the price level. However, there was understandable reluctance on the part of some countries to abandonment of exchange rate comparisons. Although the World Bank made a major contribution to finance work on PPPs, it did not use them for its analytical work because they raise the relative income levels of poor countries substantially compared to their standing in an exchange rate ranking. They feared that this would make them ineligible to borrow from IDA (the cheap loan window of the Bank). For this reason the Bank continued to rank countries by income level in its Atlas, by using a three–year moving average of exchange rates. 

ii) Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) conversion: This concept was first used by Gustav Cassel in 1918, and crudely implemented by Colin Clark in 1940. A substantial part of Clark’s price material was derived from a survey made for the Ford Motor Company, together with his own price comparisons for luxury goods and ILO material on rents in different countries. Much more sophisticated measures have been developed by co–operative research of national statistical offices and international agencies in the past few decades. They have become highly sophisticated comparative pricing exercises involving collection of carefully specified price information on a massive scale by national statistical offices for representative items of consumption, investment goods and government services. The latest OECD exercise for 1999 involved collection of prices for 2 740 items. The OEEC first developed these comparisons of real levels of expenditure and the purchasing parity of currencies in the 1950s for 8 of its member countries and rough proxies for the rest. OECD reactivated this work in 1982 in cooperation with Eurostat (see Michael Ward, 1985). In the meantime Irving Kravis, Alan Heston and Robert Summers set up their International Comparisons Project (ICP) in 1968 and published three major studies in 1975, 1978 and 1982. Their work made major contributions to the methodology of international income comparisons and greatly expanded their coverage. Their last volume covered 34 countries. Their work was taken over by the United Nations Statistical Office which made comparisons for 1980 and 1985. Altogether the two UN comparisons covered 82 countries. There were regional comparisons for some Asian, African and Middle Eastern countries by UN agencies in 1993, but UNSO did not attempt to integrate them. ICP estimation has now been taken over by the World Bank and the next exercise is planned for 2004.The main current activity in this field is by OECD–Eurostat; in 2002 they published a 1999 level comparison for 43 countries. When the ICP approach was originally developed in OEEC, the main emphasis was on binary comparison. The three most straightforward options were: i) a Paasche PPP (with “own” country quantity weights); ii) a Laspeyres PPP (with the quantity weights of the numeraire country — the United States); or iii) , as a compromise, the Fisher geometric average of the two measures. The corresponding measures of real expenditure levels were i) Laspeyres level comparisons based on the prices (unit values) of the numeraire country; ii) Paasche level comparisons based on own country prices (unit values); or iii) a Fisher geometric average of the two measures. Binary comparisons, e.g. France/US, and UK/US can be linked with the United States as the “star” country. The derivative France–UK comparison will not necessarily produce the same results as direct binary comparison of France and the United Kingdom. Such star system comparisons are not “transitive”. However, in studies I made of comparative performance of advanced capitalist countries (Maddison, 1982 and 1991), I preferred to use the Laspeyres level comparison at US prices, because this was the price structure to which the other countries in this group were converging as their productivity and demand patterns approached US levels. Comparisons can be made transitive if they are done on a “multilateral” rather than a “binary” basis. The Geary–Khamis approach (named for R.S. Geary and S.H. Khamis) is an ingenious method for multilaterising the results which provides transitivity and other desirable properties. It was used by Kravis, Heston and Summers as a method for aggregating ICP results available at the basic heading level. They used it in conjunction with the commodity product dummy (CPD) method (invented by Robert Summers) for filling holes in the basic dataset. I used PPPs of this type for 70 countries representing The World Economy, 1950–2001 609 

93.7 per cent of world GDP in 1990 (see Table 7–2). The Geary–Khamis approach gives a weight to countries corresponding to the size of their GDP, so that a large economy, like the United States, has a strong influence on the results. Eurostat (the statistical office of EU) uses a multilateral method in which all its member countries have an equal weight. This is the EKS technique (named for its inventors, Eltöto, Kovacs and Szulc). For my purpose an equi–country weighting system which treats Luxemburg and Germany as equal partners in the world economy is inappropriate, so I have a strong preference for the Geary–Khamis approach. Fortunately the OECD–Eurostat joint exercise derives both EKS and Geary– Khamis measures — see Maddison (1995), pp. 164–79 for a detailed confrontation of all the binary and multilateral PPPs published up to that time. 

iii) Penn World Tables (PWT): For countries not covered by ICP, Summers and Heston devised short–cut estimates. Their latest Penn World Tables (PWT 6.1, October 2002) provide PPP converters for 168 countries. Their estimates for countries which have never had an ICP exercise are necessarily rougher than for those where these exercises are available. For these they use much more limited price information from cost of living surveys (of diplomats, UN officials, and people working abroad for private business) as a proxy for the ICP specification prices. I used PPPs from PWT for 84 countries, 5.6 per cent of world GDP in 1990 (see Table 7–2). 

iv) ICOP (International Comparison of Real Output and Productivity): The fourth option is to compare levels of real output (value added) using census of production material on output quantities and prices. Rostas (1948) pioneered this approach for manufacturing. The first study of this type for the whole economy was a binary comparison of the United Kingdom and the United States by Paige and Bombach (1959) published by OEEC. This approach was not used in subsequent ICP comparisons, but I used it in a comparative study of economic growth in 29 countries ( Economic Progress and Policy in Developing Countries, 1970, Norton, New York). At that time there were no ICP estimates for non– OECD countries. I made estimates of value added and productivity in agriculture, industry and services and total GDP in US relative prices for the 29 countries for 1965. I merged these benchmark estimates to time series of GDP movement in the 29 countries back to 1950, 1938, 1913 and 1870, wherever possible. The basic approach was very similar to that in this volume, although the measures of GDP levels in the benchmark year and the time series for GDP growth were much cruder than they are now. In Maddison (1983) I compared my production–side estimates with those of Kravis, Heston and Summers (1982). I also used the two sets of estimates as benchmarks for merger with time series on economic growth to see what the implications were for comparative levels of performance back to 1820. I concluded provisionally that the ICP approach probably exaggerated service output in the poorer countries, but that an authoritative view on this topic required more careful study on the production side. I therefore set up the ICOP (International Comparison of Output and Productivity) project at the University of Groningen in 1983. The Groningen Growth and Development Centre has produced nearly 100 research memoranda on productivity as well as Ph. D theses on economic growth and levels of performance by Bart van Ark, Tom Elfring, Pierre van der Eng, Andre Hofman, Sompop Manarungsan, Kees van der Meer, Nanno Mulder, Dirk Pilat, Jaap Sleifer and Marcel Timmer. These theses are in the Kuznetsian tradition with fully transparent and complete statistical appendices showing sources and methods of approach (see Maddison and van Ark, 2000). The ICOP programme puts primary emphasis on analysis of labour, capital and joint factor productivity for major sectors of the economy. It was not intended as a rival to IPC, but provides and alternative and complementary approach to the problem of international comparison of GDP levels. So far, the project has covered one or more sectors of the economy for more than 30 countries which together represent more than half of world GDP (see http://www.eco.rug.nl/ggdc/dseries/icop.shtml#top). Recently the scale of its systemic comparative exercises has increased in country coverage and sector detail, in co–operation with international agencies including Euostat, ILO and OECD. The most recent ICOP work was a study for 19 countries, covering more than 30 sectors. These results are a useful crosscheck on the ICP measures and on the validity of my 1990 benchmarks as an anchor for analysis of levels of performance in the past (see HS–8 below). The World Economy: Historical Statistics 610 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

Europe and Western Offshoots: 99.5 per cent of regional GDP from ICP 6 for 1990; 22 countries from OECD–Eurostat and 6 countries from ECE (see OECD, 1993; ECE, 1994; Maddison, 1995, p. 172 and Maddison, 2001, pp. 189–90); 0.4 per cent of regional GDP (Bulgaria, Cyprus and Malta) from PWT version 5.6; 0.1 per cent from proxy estimates (Albania, Andorra, Channel Isles, Faeroe Isles, Gibraltar, Greenland, Isle of Man, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino). 

Latin America: 95.1 per cent of regional GDP (18 countries) from ICP. As there was no Latin America ICP exercise for 1990 or later; I used ICP 3 for 2 countries and ICP 4 for 16 countries updated to 1990 (see Kravis, Heston and Summers, 1982; UN, 1987; and Maddison, 2001, p. 199). Updating involves adjustment for the GDP volume change in the specified country between the reference year and 1990, and for the movement in the US GDP deflator in the same interval. 3.2 per cent of regional GDP (Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Nicaragua, Puerto Rico, St. Kitts Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago) from PWT version 5.6; 1.7 per cent from proxy estimates (Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, Cuba, French Guyana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, Montserrat, Netherlands Antilles, St. Pierre and Miquelon, Turks and Caicos, Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands). 

Asia: 92.9 per cent of regional GDP (24 countries) from ICP or equivalent. I used ICP 3 for 2 countries, ICP 4 for 5 countries. ICP 5 for 3 countreis and linked Bangladesh and Pakistan to their 1950 level relative to India. All 12 were updated to 1990. OECD estimates were available for Japan and Mongolia for 1990, and I made an estimate for China for 1990 based on Maddison (1998) and Ren (1997). ICP 7 estimates were available from ESCAP(1999) and ESCWA (1997) for 9 countries for 1993 and backdated to 1990 (see Maddison, 2001, pp. 202, 208, 219–20). Backdating involves the same procedure as updating. 6.1 per cent of regional GDP (Bhutan, Burma, Fiji, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Papua New Guinea, Saudi Arabia, Solomon Islands, Taiwan, Tonga, UAE, Vanuatu, Western Samoa, and Yemen) from PWT version 5.6; 1 per cent of regional GDP from proxy estimates (Afghanistan, American Samoa, Brunei, Cambodia, French Polynesia, Guam, Kiribati, Lebanon, Macao, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Micronesia, New Caledonia, North Korea, Northern Marianas, Palau, Wallis and Futuna. 

Africa: 75.8 per cent of regional GDP from PWT 5.6 and 22.7 per cent from PWT 6.1; proxy estimates for 1.5 per cent of regional GDP (Equatorial Guinea, Libya, Mayotte, St. Helena, São Tomé & Principe and Western Sahara); see source note HS–6 and Table 6–11.

d) Alternative Estimates of Movement of World GDP, 1970 onwards 

The IMF now makes annual estimates of the growth of world GDP in real terms, available back to 1970. Their preference is for PPP adjustment, but they publish an alternative with exchange rate weights (see IMF, Economic Outlook , September 2002, pp. 189–199, which describes their method). Their PPP estimates (with 1996 weights) are derived from ICP. For countries not covered by ICP, they estimate PPPs using a regression technique in which exchange rates are one of the independent variables. Table 7–3 compares the year–to–year movement of their world aggregate and mine. The IMF measure with PPP weights shows faster growth for 1970–2001 than I do (3.9 per cent a year instead of 3.3 per cent). One would not expect complete concordance as my PPP weights are different and my coverage more complete, but it seems clear that the IMF exaggerates growth. Its measure excludes non–member countries, and makes no proxy estimates for countries where estimation is difficult. Some of these — Afghanistan, Bosnia, Cuba, North Korea, Serbia — have had negative growth. It is clear from their database that they have not adjusted growth estimates for countries which formerly used the Soviet system of national accounts. For China they show GDP growth averaging 8.5 per cent a year for 1970–2001, whereas my adjusted estimate is 6.5 per cent. For Germany for the same period, they show growth averaging 2.2 per cent a year. I show 2.0 per cent as I include East Germany for the whole post–war period. For 1973–2001 they show Russian growth averaging 0.7 per cent and –0.7 for the Ukraine, whereas I have –0.2 per cent for Russia and –1.5 for Ukraine The Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations also publishes annual estimates of world GDP, available back to 1980. Their preference is for an aggregate with exchange rate conversion, but they publish an alternative using PPP converters (see World Economic Survey 2002 , pp. 4, 278–280 and 285). Their PPP weights are for 1995, and are derived from ICP and PWT. It is not clear from the published description how many countries are included, but their world aggregate is probably more comprehensive than that of the IMF. The UN measure shows slower growth than the IMF, and is closer to mine. Table 7-3.

# HS–8: The World Economy, 1–2001 AD 

Tables HS–8 show levels of population, GDP and per capita GDP in 20 countries, 7 regions and the world for eight benchmark years in the past two millennia. There are also 5 analytical tables showing rates of growth and shares of world population and GDP. HS–7 explained the derivation of estimates for 1950–2001. Earlier than this, it is useful to distinguish between estimates for 1820–1950 and those for the centuries before 1820 where the documentation is weaker and the element of conjecture bigger. 

Population Movement 1820–1950 

For West European countries and Western Offshoots, population estimates for this period are based mainly on censuses dating back to the eighteenth century for Scandinavia and Spain and the early nineteenth for most other countries. The sources are described in HS–1 and HS–2. For Western Europe, annual estimates, adjusted to a midyear basis are shown for all countries back to 1820. For Western Offshoots, they are shown separately for the indigenous population and those of European/ African origin at decade intervals for 1820–1870, with annual estimates for the total population thereafter. For Eastern Europe, annual estimates are shown from 1920. Before the first world–war, these countries were divided between the Austro–Hungarian, Ottoman, Russian and German Empires. Derivation of estimates in the territory corresponding to present boundaries is possible, but they are too rough to warrant presentation on an annual basis. Estimates for the territory of the former USSR are also too rough to warrant annual presentation before 1920. Population sources are described in HS–3. For Latin America annual estimates are shown back to 1900 for 23 countries. The 1820 and 1870 estimates in Maddison (2001) for the smaller countries are revised and augmented from the Cambridge History of Latin America , Engerman and Higman (1997) and other sources cited in HS–4. For Asia annual estimates are shown from 1913 for the 16 core countries, and for benchmark years 1820, 1850 1870 1890 and 1900. For China, India, Indonesia and Japan annual estimates are shown back to 1870. For other countries there are estimates for benchmark years 1820, 1870, 1900 and 1913. In most cases the sources in HS–5 are the same as in Maddison (2001). For Africa, the statistical basis is weaker than elsewhere. I show no annual estimates before 1950, but give detail for the sample countries for 1820, 1870 and 1913 in Table 6–10 of HS–6. 

Population Change 1–1820 AD 

For the centuries before 1820 the most comprehensive evidence is for population and it is of greater proportionate importance for analysis as per capita income growth was much slower then and economic growth was largely extensive. The World Economy: Historical Statistics 622 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

Demographic changes, e.g. increases in life expectancy, changes in average age which affect labour force participation, changes in the structure of the labour force, are important in providing clues to per capita income development. A striking example is the urbanisation ratio. Thanks to the work of de Vries for Europe and of Rozman for Asia, one can, for some countries, measure the proportion of population living in towns with more than 10 000 inhabitants. In the year 1000, this ratio was virtually zero in Europe (there were only 4 towns with more than 10 000 inhabitants) and in China it was 3 per cent. By 1800 the West European urban ratio was 10.6 per cent, the Chinese 3.8 per cent. When countries are able to expand their urban ratios, it indicates a growing surplus beyond subsistence in agriculture, and suggests that the non–agricultural component of economic activity is increasing. These changing differentials in urban ratios were used to buttress other evidence on per capita progress in China and Europe in Maddison (1998). The Chinese bureaucracy kept population registers which go back more than 2 000 years. These records were designed to assess taxable capacity, and include information on cultivated area and crop production, which was used by Perkins (1969) to assess long run movements in Chinese output per capita. Bagnall and Frier (1994) made brilliant use of fragments of ancient censuses to estimate occupational structure, household size, marriage patterns, fertility and life expectation in Roman Egypt of the third century. Serious work on historical demography started in the seventeenth century with John Graunt (see Prologue). Modernised techniques and similar types of evidence have been used to make retrospective estimates of population for other European countries for periods before census material was available. Investigations of this character have been carried out by a) the Office of Population Research in Princeton University (established in 1936); b) INED (Institut National des Études Démographiques) founded in the 1950s to exploit family reconstitution techniques developed by Louis Henry; c) the Cambridge Group for the History of Population and Family Structure (established in the 1970s) has carried out a massive research project to reconstitute English population size and structure on an annual basis back to 1541 (Wrigley et al ., 1997). This kind of analysis has been sharpened by the application of massive computing power. Research on Japanese population history has blossomed under the leadership of Akira Hayami and Osamu Saito. Ester Boserup’s (1965) analysis of the interaction between demographic pressure, agricultural technology and intensity of labour input in Asia has helped discredit simplistic Malthusian interpretations. There has been a flood of publications on Latin American demography and the shipment of slaves from Africa. As a result of these efforts we are better placed to measure long term changes in world population. The most detailed and best documented are those in McEvedy and Jones (1978). This was the source of my estimates for Africa (see also the masterly analysis of African development in McEvedy, 1995). Appendix B of Maddison 2001 provided source notes and estimates for 20 countries and 7 regions for benchmark years between the first century and 1700. In this study more country detail is shown for Western Europe, Western Offshoots, Latin America back to 1500 and for Africa back to the first century. There are some changes in the regional totals for Africa (see Table 6–1), but none for other regions. 

GDP Growth 1820–1950 

Before the second worldwar, only 10 countries had official estimates of national income, assembled without international guidelines to provide comparability. None of these are suitable for our purpose, but there are retrospective official estimates of fairly recent vintage which I used for Austria from 1830, Norway from 1865, Netherlands from 1913, Canada from 1926 and the United States from 1929. There were non–official estimates in pre–war years. Colin Clark (1940) made a comprehensive survey, but all those he cited have now been superseded. In the past 60 years, work on retrospective national accounts has been undertaken by a large number of scholars who have generally linked their The World Economy, 1-2001 AD 623 

series to official post–war estimates. The initial thrust for these exercises in quantitative economic history was given by Simon Kuznets. His very long career included creation of official US accounts in 1934 and 5 monographs of historical accounts for the United States in 1941–61. These set high standards of scholarship with meticulous and transparent description of sources and methods. These characteristics have permitted succeeding generations of scholars to stand on his shoulders. His persuasive power and influence stemmed from professional integrity and depth of scholarship. He was free from partisanship, open to new ideas and willing to comment sympathetically in detail on the work of others. His influence was reinforced by his style of analysis–use of ideas that could be clearly expressed in literary form, and implemented with relatively simple statistical techniques. He encouraged a band of scholars all over the world to consider that such an enterprise was feasible, exciting, important and rewarding. He encouraged comparable studies for Australia, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Sweden and the United Kingdom. To facilitate this research he helped found the International Association for Income and Wealth in 1947, persuaded the US Social Science Research Council to finance comparative research in other countries, and played a major role in the creation of the Yale Growth Center, which produced basic growth studies for Argentina, Egypt, Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, and the USSR. Between 1953 and 1989 he published 8 volumes containing 70 analytical essays comparing the results which emerged from these quantitative studies and assessing their significance for the study of “modern economic growth”. The temporal horizon of this new generation of Kuznetsian scholarship was concentrated on developments since the mid–nineteenth century. Several university centres are now active in this field, sponsoring their own research and strengthening international networks by holding workshops. Kazushi Ohkawa organised a 14–volume study (1966– 1988) of Japanese growth at Hitotsubashi University. The University now has an ambitious comparative project on the quantitative economic history of China, Indonesia, Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. In the Netherlands, the University of Groningen has been active in this field since 1982. Its Growth and Development Centre has played a major role in international studies of productivity levels and in developing an international database on economic growth. It has published research studies on GDP growth in Brazil, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, Taiwan, Thailand, and a six–country comparison for Latin America. It maintained close links with Jan Luiten van Zanden’s team working on Dutch growth in the University of Utrecht and with the University of Leuven’s research on long–run growth in Belgium. It is also linked with the COPPAA group (Comparisons of Output, Productivity and Purchasing Power in Asia and Australia), based in Brisbane, which has carried out a number of studies of comparative performance of economies in the Asia–Pacific region, and was associated with the research of Maddison (1998) on China and Sivasubramonian (2000) on India. Scandinavia has a long history in this field. There have been five rounds of research in Sweden since 1937, and Olle Krantz has made annual estimates of GDP growth since 1800. Riitta Hjerppe supervised a 13 volume study for Finland which was completed in 1989. Svend Aage Hansen produced the second major study of Danish growth in 1974, with annual GDP estimates back to 1818. There is now a Nordic Group, which is revising the Scandinavian historical accounts to enhance their comparability. The International Association for Research in Income and Wealth (IARIW) has held conferences and workshops on measurement of comparative GDP growth and levels of performance, problems of methodology and definition since 1949, and has published its quarterly Review of Income and Wealth since 1968. Its membership has always included official statisticians, established scholars working on historical accounts, and younger researchers serving their apprenticeship in this field and has played a major role in developing a standardised approach and extending the range of countries for which studies are available. The European Historical Economics Society (EHES) has also been active in promoting research on quantitative economic history since 1997 when it created the European Review of Economic History. 

The vitality of recent research activity is clear from Table 8–1 which shows amendments to my estimates since publication of Maddison (2001). The proxy estimates I use for Bulgaria, Poland, Romania and Yugoslavia for 1870 to the 1920s were derived from David Good and Tongshu Ma (1999). Their approach is a variant of that developed originally by Wilfred Beckerman (1966) as a shortcut cross– section technique to measure comparative income levels. Nick Crafts (1983) was the first to use it for diachronic analysis (see Maddison, 1990). The World Economy: Historical Statistics 624 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

GDP Growth before 1820 

Western Europe: Per capita GDP growth rates prior to 1820 in Maddison (2001) are unchanged for Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and 13 small territories, but levels for 1500–1700 for these countries are affected by the amendments for 1820. In the case of France, the 1700–1820 growth rate is unchanged, but for the second half of the seventeenth century I assume stagnant per capita income because of hunger crises and the depressing influence of more or less continuous warfare, as noted by Boisguilbert and Vauban. 

Western Offshoots: There are changes in the “multicultural” per capita GDP estimates 1700–1820 for Australia, Canada and New Zealand, as specified in detail in Tables 2–1 and 2–5; estimates for earlier centuries are unchanged. 

Eastern Europe: Per capita GDP growth rates prior to 1820 are unchanged (0.1 percent a year), but the level for 1500–1700 is higher due to use of the Good–Ma proxies for the nineteenth century. There was no significant change for Russia. 

Latin America: More detailed scrutiny of the evidence for the Caribbean sugar colonies led to upward revision of their per capita GDP and population levels in 1700–1820. See Table 4–1 for a more detailed sub–regional specification for 1500–1820 than in Maddison (2001). Table 8-1. Amendments to GDP Estimates in Maddison (2001) for 1820-1950

Asia: GDP estimates for China, India, Indonesia and Japan in Maddison (2001) are unchanged, but I was able to make a more detailed scrutiny for West Asia thanks to recent work by Sevket Pamuk (see Tables 5–6 and 5–8). This raised the 1820 per capita GDP level for this group and its rate of growth 1700–1820. However the level estimates for 1700 and earlier are unchanged. 

Africa: I have made more detailed sub–regional conjectures of long–run per capita GDP movement than in Maddison (2001), and presented a detailed analysis of the forces affecting the contours of demographic development. See source note HS–6, and Tables 6–1 and 6–2. 

Crosschecking Measures of Comparative Levels of Performance before 1950 

In this study, the bulk of the evidence consists of measures of inter–temporal change in GDP volume in individual countries, moving backwards from 2001. These are merged with measures of comparative GDP levels in the reference year 1990 at 1990 prices. The derivation of the inter–spatial estimates is explained in the source notes to HS–7 and in Table 7–2. A more comprehensive survey of the array of level estimates available for years between 1970 and 1990 can be found in Maddison (1995) pp. 162–179. This indicates the range of variance between the results of the successive ICP and PWT rounds and compares the attributes of alternative aggregation procedures (Paasche, Laspeyres, Fisher, EKS and Geary–Khamis). Heston and Summers (1993) compare the GDP growth rates implicit in ICP cross–section estimates of the relative standing of countries at different points of time with direct measures of inter–temporal GDP growth. They do not suggest that deviations between implicit and direct measures cast serious doubt on the latter. But such deviations are obviously a useful crosscheck. I am satisfied that the 1990 benchmark estimates I used are the best presently available, with the possible exception of those for Eastern Europe and Africa, where the results of the OECD (2002) and PWT 6.1 exercises were too recent to be fully digested here (see Table 6–11). My 1990 benchmark can be subjected to comprehensive review when the World Bank’s ICP exercise for 2004 becomes available. However, updates of the 1990 benchmarks are less important than crosschecks on their validity as measures of relative performance in the distant past. It is clear that patterns of expenditure have changed radically over the long–term (as illustrated by the comparison of British expenditure patterns in 1688 and 1996 in Table 1), and there have also been big changes in relative prices and output structure. Some of these changes may have had a similar impact across countries, but this certainly needs to be investigated. The most promising crosschecks on my estimates of relative standing in the past have come from binary comparisons of countries which have a significant weight in the world total. Some of these I have done myself, and there are several others which confirm my findings, e. g. those of Broadberry, Toda and van Zanden cited below. It would also be useful to have ICOP or ICP type multilateral cross–section studies for different points of time in the past. It would not be possible replicate the detail or systemic rigour of modern ICP exercises (prices for more than 2000 items for 200 categories of expenditure), but real wage analysts have accumulated quite a lot of material on price structures which could be mobilised for this purpose. It would be useful and probably feasible to construct such a measure e. g. for 1900 or 1870, using reduced information, on the same lines as PWT estimates for countries where there has been no ICP exercise. In the absence of such measures, Leandro Prados has made proxy estimates of PPPs and per capita income relatives for benchmark years since 1820, using econometrics, but no information on relative price structures. The results are too shaky to be a serious challenge to my estimates of relative levels in 1820 (see Table 8–2). The World Economy: Historical Statistics 626 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

There are some authors (Paul Bairoch, Susan Hanley and Kenneth Pomeranz) whose judgement of the relative standing of major Asian countries and Western Europe is very different from mine. I give my reasons for disagreeing with them below. Finally, I would like to comment on the real wage literature, some of which contradicts my view of West European development over the past few centuries. 

## a) Confirmatory Crosschecks 

i) Stephen Broadberry (1997 a): provides the most important of the binary cross–checks because he scrutinises the relative standing of the two successive lead counties (the United Kingdom and the United States) for benchmark years between 1870 and 1990. He found US productivity in manufacturing ahead of the United Kingdom by the middle of the 19th century, whereas I found that US productivity leadership at the aggregate level (GDP per man hour) began several decades later. At first sight these judgements seemed incompatible. As a test, Broadberry (1997 a) made an ICOP type analysis of performance in 9 sectors and aggregate GDP in the two countries for 1870–1990 using 1937 value added weights. His results were compatible with my aggregate comparison with 1990 expenditure weights. Broadberry, 1997 b, compared UK and German performance for the same period with 1935 weights. He arrived at a similar confirmatory result, reconciling my estimate of the relative standing of the two countries in terms of aggregate GDP using 1990 expenditure weights, with his aggregate of value added by sector, using 1935 weights. 

ii) Yasushi Toda (1990): presented a binary comparison of Japanese and Russian urban consumption levels in 1913 and Japan/USSR in 1975–6. He had a matched sample of 46 items at Japanese and Russian prices for 1913, and 110 items for 1975–6. He found the Japanese real per capita consumption level below that in Russia in 1913 and significantly higher in 1975–6. He had no explicit measure of growth, but the implicit differential in growth rates was very similar to what I found for per capita GDP for this period. 

iii) Jan Luiten van Zanden (2003) expressed his concern that distortions may arise in using 1990 benchmarks back to 1820 because of changes in relative price structures. As a test, he compared Dutch growth to his new estimates of Javanese GDP growth for 1815–1880 and made PPP adjustments to compare levels of per capita income in the 1820s. He concludes that “in the 1820s per capita GDP in Java was about one third of Dutch per capita GDP” and that my estimates of relative levels of the two economies in 1820 are “by and large correct”. He also makes comparative estimates of real wages, food consumption patterns, life expectation, and comparative physical stature of Dutch and Indonesians. These “direct indicators” show a narrower gap. He suggests that the relationship between real wages and average per capita GDP is highly variable and dependent on many factors such as the length of the working year, distribution of income, relative prices etc. 

## b) Conflicting Interpretations 

i) Leandro Prados (2000) offers proxy estimates of per capita GDP levels relative to the United States for 17 benchmark years between 1820 and 1990. For 1880 he shows estimates for 23 countries but the coverage drops to 6 countries in 1820. He restricts the coverage to OECD countries, Argentina and Russia. He makes no use of inter-temporal measures of change in real GDP to estimate past levels of performance, nor does he measure price structures. Instead he backcasts an econometric relationship between purchasing power parity converters and exchange rates which prevailed in 1950-90. He has 89 ICP or OEEC direct measures of this relationship to support the 155 estimates he shows for 7 reference years from 1950 to 1990 (see his tables 3 and 9). The gaps are filled by a structural equation, which attributes spreads between PPPs and exchange rates to four variables: a) openness of the economies as measured by the ratio of foreign trade (exports and imports) to GDP; b) the ratio of net The World Economy, 1-2001 AD 627 

capital inflows to GDP: c) the size of the country in terms of its surface area and population; and 

d) a periphery dummy (in cases where per capita income is less than half of the average level). His cross– section relatives are derived from estimates of these four items for the years he covers, and knowledge of the exchange rates prevailing in those years. With this information he infers the Paasche PPP for a given year in the past for each of the countries. He applies these PPPs to convert estimates of nominal GDP in each country from national currencies into US dollars of the year in question. For years before 1950, he has no ICP or PWT (reduced-information) measures of PPPs. He assumes that the PPP/exchange rate relationships for 1950-1990 are a good guide to the situation in 1820-1938. He provides two pages of source notes, but shows only his results and none of the basic material on PPPs, his four variables and estimates of nominal GDP. Estimates of variables a and b are likely to be pretty shaky for the early years, and nominal estimates of GDP are often not available. This is the case for his benchmark country, the United States where he derived a nominal value by reflating the real GDP estimates for 1820–1860 with a cost of living and a wholesale price index. Table 8–2 shows the Prados results for the 6 countries where his estimates go back to 1820. It compares his per capita relatives and mine for 1900 and 1820. It shows my estimates in 1990 international dollars, and his implicit absolute levels, derived by multiplying his relatives by my estimate for the United States. In the bottom panel I compare my estimates of per capita growth with his implicit growth rates. There are very big differences between his relatives and mine for 1820, smaller but appreciable differences for 1900. My growth rates for per capita GDP 1820–1900 are very different from his implicit rates. His growth rate for Australia is much slower than mine, but he shows much faster growth for the four European countries, with France and Denmark growing faster than the United States. Table 8–2.

ii) Paul Bairoch (1930-1999) was a very prolific quantitative historian, who published many comparative studies of GNP levels, urbanisation and labour force participation. A good deal of his analysis concentrated on the forces making for divergence in the growth of advanced capitalist countries and the third world. He argued (see Bairoch, 1967) that the third world was impoverished by the development process and policies of the rich countries. In Bairoch , 1981, pp 8, 12, 14, he showed the “third world” with a slightly higher average per capita GNP than the “developed countries” in 1750, and slightly lower in 1800. He showed China at more or less the same level as Western Europe in 1800, and Latin America ahead of North America. Bairoch’s source notes were frequently cryptic and often cited “personal estimates” he did not publish. They were most exiguous for Asia or Latin America and his results for these continents must therefore be taken with a pinch of salt. The most detailed documentation of his estimates can be found in “Europe’s Gross National Product: 1800-1975”, Journal of European Economic History , Fall 1976. I commented on the quality of these estimates in Maddison (1990), p. 104. Bairoch’s last major work, ( Victoires et Déboires, Gallimard, Paris, 1997, 3 vols., 2 788 pages) is a massive, comprehensive and fascinating survey of world economic history from 1492 to 1995. It is much less quantitative than most of his other work. He has a very small table P.4 on p. 111 of volume 1 comparing the aggregate per capita GNP performance of the “developed countries” (Europe, Western Offshoots and Japan) and the “third world” (Africa, Asia and Latin America) for 6 benchmark years between 1750 and 1995. As in his earlier work, the third world is credited with a higher level than the developed group in 1750, with minimal progress until after 1950, but he shows no country detail for the third world. Table XII.2 in volume 2, pp. 252–3, presents estimates for each of his 24 “developed countries” for 7 benchmark years from 1800 to 1913. The estimates for Europe are similar to those he presented in 1976 and are in 1960 dollars derived mainly from the OEEC (1958) study of purchasing power, augmented by the proxy PPPs in Beckerman (1966). To me the most surprising and interesting part of his 1997 study is his discussion of the relative performance and interaction of the European and Asian economies between 1500 and 1800 (pp. 527– 645). He suggests that Asia was probably somewhat more advanced than Europe around 1500 and that by the eighteenth century this advantage had disappeared. The Muslim advantage over Europe in the Abbasid caliphate peaked in the 10th century; Chinese superiority had been greatest in the 12th century; the peak for Moghul India was in the 16th century, and that of the Ottoman Empire around 1600. Stagnation or decline followed thereafter, whereas Europe made substantial progress from 1500 to 1800 (see pp. 642–5). This analysis is difficult to reconcile with his earlier position, or the estimates in Table P.4, but it is much nearer to my view of the relative performance of these two parts of the world economy between 1500 and 1800. 

iii) Susan Hanley is a demographer and social historian who has concentrated mainly on the economic history of Tokugawa Japan. She is a member of the revisionist school which found evidence to warrant a much more positive view of economic performance from 1600 to the 1860s than that of an earlier generation of scholars. However, she is an unconstrained admirer of Japan, and greatly exaggerates its level of performance in the 1860s. In Hanley (1997) she asserted that “Japanese physical well–being in the 1860s was at least as high as in nineteenth century England”. Her evidence for England is pretty flimsy. She admits that Japanese ate virtually no meat, but alleges that this was also the case in mid– nineteenth century England. She alleges that English working class diets in the mid–nineteenth century consisted largely of “bread and margarine” (i.e. at a time before margarine was invented). In fact, we can see from Table 1 (in the Prologue) that already in 1695 only 20 per cent of English food and drink expenditure consisted of bread or things made of meal or flour, and 35 per cent consisted of meat, fish, and dairy products. In assessing the relative position of two countries at a given point in the past, it is always useful to consider their growth trajectories since that point. The historical accounts of both Japan and the United Kingdom are of high quality. Our basic tables show that per capita income has risen 28–fold in Japan since 1870. In Britain it rose 6–fold. If Hanley’s judgement on nineteenth century levels were correct, Japan would now have a gigantic lead over the United Kingdom. In fact the two countries had a similar level of per capita GDP in 2001.

iv) Kenneth Pomeranz (2000) presents a fascinating comparative picture of Chinese economic performance in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The comparison is mainly with Western Europe. There are many penetrating insights into the differences between these two areas. His main argument is that both were subject to Malthusian/ecological constraints, that Chinese performance was in many respects better than that of Europe before 1800. He suggests that Western Europe was “a non–too–unusual economy; it became a fortunate freak only when unexpected and significant discontinuities in the late eighteenth and especially nineteenth centuries enabled it to break through the fundamental constraints of energy and resource availability that had previously limited everyone’s 

horizons”. Pomeranz relies mainly on illustrative evidence and partial indicators of performance to back his judgement. There are only four tables with no attempt at macro–quantification (except for his comparison of life expectancy). He does not provide a chronological profile of development in Europe or China before and beyond his point of comparison. He has one passing reference to Needham, and little discussion of the forces affecting the divergent development of technology in China and Europe. His conclusions are very different from mine. In Maddison (1998) I concluded that Western Europe drew level with China in the fourteenth century and that its average per capita level was twice the Chinese in 1820 (see Table 8–3).   

> http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/456125276116 The World Economy: Historical Statistics 630 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – ©OECD 2006

I find Pomeranz’s judgements unconvincing. In 1800, the degree of urbanisation was three times higher in Western Europe than in China, the proportion of the population employed in agriculture was a good deal smaller, though the European diet included a much higher proportion of meat and dairy products. Chinese life expectation was two–thirds of that in Western Europe. Pomeranz stresses Western Europe’s benefits from international trade, which augmented its supply of food and raw materials from the “ghost acreage” of distant lands. He treats this benefit as if it were a windfall gain. In fact, China turned its back on international trade in the middle of the fifteenth century, and the Ching dynasty forbade settlement on its own ghost acres in Manchuria. The Pomeranz position is stated with four degrees of nuance. On p. 49 he says “it seems likely that average incomes in Japan, China and parts of southeast Asia were comparable to (or higher than) those in western Europe even in the late eighteenth century.” Elsewhere his position is more cautious, and he claims Asian superiority was characteristic only for “core regions”. Thus on p. 17, he says “core regions in China and Japan circa 1750 seem to resemble the most advanced parts of western Europe”. For China, his core region is the lower Yangtse (which had about 18 per cent of China’s population). Here he is on firmer ground, but I think he still exaggerates Chinese performance. Research on Chinese economic history has increased substantially in quantity and quantity in the past two decades. Li (1998) has shown significant advances in productivity and income in the lower Yangtse area during the Ching dynasty. Ma (2003) shows its per capita land tax revenue was about 145 per cent of that for China as a whole in 1753. My estimate of Chinese and West European income levels in 1750 can be derived by interpolating between the estimates for 1700 and 1820 in Table 8c. If Ma’s fiscal estimate is taken as a proxy for lower Yangtse per capita income around 1750, it would have been about 870 dollars compared to 1 080 for western Europe as a whole and more than 1 400 for the United Kingdom. On p. 44, Pomeranz states that “Europeans were not ahead in overall productivity in 1750”. This proposition I find completely implausible, because Chinese multi–cropping of rice, intensive water management and rural industry demanded much higher labour inputs, (particularly in the lower Yangtse region) than was the case in Europe. Ester Boserup has stressed increased labour intensity as the Chinese response to land shortage. Pomeranz’s obsession with Malthusian constraints leads him to neglect this Chinese–European differential in labour inputs. Pomeranz, p. 37 suggests that Chinese longevity was “quite comparable” to European. He cites an estimate of Chinese life expectancy of 32 years at age 1 for both sexes combined in Manchuria in 1792–1867 (from Lee and Campbell, 1997). He compares this with the Wrigley and Schofield (1981) estimate of English life expectancy at birth of 37 years for 1600–1749. Following a critique by Razzell, he suggests that Wrigley and Schofield got it wrong and that their figure should be reduced to “somewhere between 31.6 and 34.0”, i.e. an average of 32.8. If this were a legitimate correction, it would mean that longevity in England and China were indeed “quite comparable”. However, their estimate for England should be adjusted upwards, not downwards. Life expectation at age 1 in eighteenth century England was about 7 years higher than at birth, because 17 per cent of infants died before their first birthday (I am grateful to Jim Oeppen for this information). The Cambridge group rebutted Razzell’s critique in their 1997 study (Wrigley, Davies, Oeppen, and Schofield). In Maddison (2001) I compared life expectation in different parts of the world in 1820. The average for Western Europe was 36 years and 24 for Asia at birth. There are at least four views on the contours of long–run Chinese development and two on West European. On China, Joseph Needham’s view was that its technology gave it a lead over Western Europe from the second century AD. “Chinese evolution represented a slowly rising curve. Running at a higher and sometimes much higher level than Europe between the second and fifteenth centuries”. Because of its meritocratic bureaucracy, its precocity in developing printing and the existence of a common written language, best–practice technology was more easily diffused than in Europe (a point stressed by Justin Yifu Lin, 1995). China lost its leadership position because it had no counterpart to Europe’s The World Economy, 1-2001 AD 631 

scientific revolution. Needham gave a graphical comparison of the contours of Chinese and European technological development in Clerks and Craftsmen in China and the West (1970), p. 414. It is similar in shape to my graph of Chinese and West European per capita GDP in Maddison, 2001, p. 42, except that Needham makes no allowance for Sung exceptionalism. Mark Elvin’s (1973) interpretation is that China made a major advance in the Sung dynasty (960– 1280), and had high–level stagnation until the nineteenth century. I think Elvin is correct in stressing the special character of Sung experience. However, he did not attempt macro–quantification, and his qualitative judgement probably implies a bigger leap in the Sung than I find. I think Elvin overstates stagnation after the Sung. Between 1400 and 1820, Chinese population grew significantly faster than that of Western Europe, and its GDP growth was only slightly less than Europe’s. China experienced extensive growth, whereas Europe had a mild degree of intensive growth. My interpretation is a hybrid of Needham and Elvin. It is summarised in quantitative terms in Table 8–3 and in graphical form in Maddison (2001), p. 42. The least plausible interpretation is that of Kang Chao (1986, pp. 87, 89, 216–220). He suggests that per capita grain output rose by half from the 1st to the 11th century, followed by a millennium of decline, with per capita output falling back to 1st century levels in 1949, because of Malthusian pressure of population on limited land resources. The sources for his estimates are not adequately documented, and their plausibility is not heightened when he throws in supposedly corroborative estimates of real wages which rise (in sheng of grain per person) from 120 in the first century to 800 in 1086 and fall to 12 in 1818! My view of the contours of West European development is that there was a decline in per capita income after the fall of the Roman Empire, which has no counterpart in China, and a sustained process of slow per capita growth from the eleventh to the early nineteenth century. Thereafter there was a substantial acceleration of growth. The alternative view is that there were centuries of Malthusian torpor followed by an industrial revolution and a sudden take–off. Pomeranz’s interpretation involves acceptance of this second view. 

v) The Real Wage Literature and its Relation to National Accounts. The serious study of real wages began with Thorold Rogers (1823–1890). His major works in this field were A History of Agriculture and Prices in England (7 vols. 1866–1902) and Six Centuries of Work and Wages (1884). Rogers was an active politician, as well as a prolific price historian and professor of political economy in Oxford. He was a Liberal member of parliament (1880–1886) and an advocate of political reform who argued that the condition of English wage earners could be improved by extending the franchise and encouraging trade union activity. Later generations of real wage analysts have generally followed his lead: a) adopting a very long–term perspective; b) giving almost exclusive emphasis to labour income; c) giving substantial attention to price history, d) reaching pessimistic conclusions. However, Rogers differed from some of his disciples in two important respects. He was not a Malthusian, and would certainly not have regarded real wages as a proxy for real GDP. For him low wages were the result of exploitation of the labourer by the ruling elite. He made a clear distinction between wage income and national income, as is clear in his citation of Gregory King’s estimates of inequality (Rogers, 1884 pp. 463–465). He summarised his position, saying (p. 355) “society may make notable progress in wealth, and wages remain low, …relatively speaking, the working man of today is not so well off as he was in the fifteenth century” It is interesting to compare his work with that of his near–contemporary Michael Mulhall (1836– 1900). Mulhall was a pioneer in comparative analysis of national income. His main concern was to measure aggregate value added (see Table 3 in the Prologue), whereas Rogers concentrated on one kind of income. Mulhall’s temporal horizon was much shorter than that of Rogers, and he was not a social or political reformer. Mulhall’s estimates all referred to nominal income, except for the United Kingdom, where he used wheat prices as a crude deflator. Rogers devoted massive effort to price history. The World Economy: Historical Statistics 632 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

The Rogers–Mulhall dichotomy is interesting because real wage analysis and historical national accounts have continued to tread separate paths. Historical national accountants have progressed well beyond Mulhall. They have developed techniques for measuring real output and real expenditure, and have deflators for the components of these aggregates, but they almost never attempt separate deflation of the components of nominal income (see Maddison, 1995, pp. 120–123). Until recently real wage analysis had not progressed much beyond Rogers. It continued to ignore non–wage income, and used data for a small fraction of wage earners without indicating what proportion of the labour force were covered. National accountants take a macroeconomic view, have developed a standardised system (which defines coverage within clearly defined boundaries of activity) and there are fairly comprehensive crosschecks on consistency. However, their time horizon was, until recently, much shorter than that of real wage analysts. In the 1920s–40s there was a coordinated European–US research effort with financial support from the International Committee on Price History. Some of the researchers (Beveridge and Posthumus) concentrated on price history, but there was also a substantial effort to measure long–term trends in real wages. It is clear from the account of Cole and Crandall (1964) that they had no guidelines on coverage and methodology. They measured wage rates rather than earnings, without indicating annual hours worked. There was no attempt to determine the relative size of non–wage income. Within the field of wage–income, sample coverage was usually quite small. The validity of the inter–temporal measures was questionable and there were no cross–country comparisons of wage levels. From 1939 to 1968, Jürgen Kuczynski (1904–95) provided a Marxist counterpart, producing 40 volumes on the deteriorating condition of the proletariat under capitalism. At that time there was some interaction with national accountants. Colin Clark (1940) used real wages as a real income proxy for 20 countries. Arthur Bowley (1869–1957) made a considerable effort to incorporate real wage and real income analysis into national accounts. A third wave of interest in real wages was sparked in 1952–57, when Henry Phelps Brown (1906–94), Sheila Hopkins and other associates produced scholarly articles developing new annual measures of wages and prices in England from 1264 to 1954. (Phelps Brown and Hopkins, 1981) They synthesised the work of the pre–war group (Elsas, Hamilton and Pribram) on Austria, Germany, and Spain, and made new estimates for France. For England, they had daily wage rates for building workers hired by Oxford and Cambridge colleges, Eton school and some other employers in the south of England. For the most part, they had 15 or more quotations a year for craftsmen and 3 for building workers. Between 1500 and 1800 there were 82 years for which they had no wage estimates. They had no data on weekly or annual earnings or days worked. They did not discuss the representativity of their measure. Even if their coverage of building workers is assumed to be adequate, they represented only 5 per cent of the workforce in 1700. People employed in agriculture were 56 per cent of the total and most of them were producing and directly consuming the items which figure in the price index. Many others, such as servants, artisans, the clergy, and the armed forces received an appreciable part of their remuneration in kind. A large part of the working population were thus sheltered from the impact of price rises. In spite of these shortcomings, their findings attracted interest because of the long period they covered and their meticulous scholarship in providing detailed and transparent discussion of sources and methods. As there was no work in historical national accounts for this period, their results were readily accepted. The conclusions of Phelps Brown and Hopkins were extremely pessimistic. From 1500 to 1800, they suggested that real wages for building workers in southern England fell by 60 per cent. Their results were enthusiastically received by Braudel and Spooner (Cambridge Economic History of Europe, 1967, p. 429). They concluded that “from the late fifteenth century until well into the beginning of the eighteenth century, the standard of living in Europe progressively declined. Before this time, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries …conditions were better”. This judgement was easily accepted in France because members of the Annales school were profoundly Malthusian. Le Roy Ladurie’s judgement in 1960 was that Languedoc had suffered recurrent and prolonged population setbacks because limited land resources had set rigid limits to agricultural production. His inaugural lecture at the Collège de The World Economy, 1-2001 AD 633 

France in 1973 restated this notion of l’histoire immobile. Wilhelm Abel (1978), the German historian, suggested that real living standards fell in Germany from the first half of the fourteenth to the first half of the eighteenth century. The Phelps Brown analysis was also accepted by Wrigley and Schofield (1981) as a complement to their analysis of English demographic experience from 1541 to 1871. They found it convenient because it was “an approximate guide to fluctuations in the standard of living” in their period (pp. 312– 313). They adjusted the results to interpolate gaps (pp. 638–41), they made some judicious comments on its deficiencies, but they took the real wage index to be a representative picture of living standards. In their analysis (pp. 402–412) of the relation between population growth and living standards they concluded that Malthus was right “Before 1800 matters fell out much as Malthus insisted they must..the faster population grew, the lower the standard of living and the grimmer the struggle to exist” A “decisive break” occurred during the industrial revolution. They rejected Boserup’s view that “population growth in a pre–industrial economy tended to spark off changes in agricultural techniques which would allow productivity per head in agriculture to be maintained, albeit at the cost of longer hours of work, while at the same time encouraging changes elsewhere in the economy that would lead to a rise in output per head overall”. The Phelps Brown results have now been almost universally rejected as a proxy for the movement of real GDP per capita. Braudel reversed his judgement with characteristic insouciance. In Braudel (1985) p. 314, he stated that there were “clear continuities in European history. The first of these is the regular rise in GNP come hell or high water”. Wrigley (1988) concluded his penetrating new analysis thus: ”The single most remarkable feature of the economic history of England between the later sixteenth and the early nineteenth century was the rise in output per head in agriculture”(p. 39). Jan de Vries (1993) joined the attack on the real wage approach. He questioned the representativity of construction worker experience, emphasised the large number of items omitted from the Phelps Brown price index, and contrasted its sombre and stagnant conclusions with his own evidence from probate inventories “All the studies I have examined for colonial New England and the Chesapeake, England and the Netherlands consistently reveal two features. With very few exceptions, each generation of decedents from the mid–seventeenth to the late eighteenth century left behind more and better possessions”. He concluded that “economic growth began earlier than previously thought, that the transforming power of industry was felt later than previously thought , and that the century of the Industrial Revolution witnessed no sharp acceleration–not in production, not in consumption”. In de Vries (1994) he developed the notion of an “industrious revolution” which is similar to Ester Boserup’s (1965) analysis in the Asian context. It helps explain how intensified labour inputs overcame what were previously considered Malthusian constraints. One reason real wage analysis remained primitive was that historical national accountants and their leading figure, Kuznets, showed no interest in it. Kuznets’ (1973, pp. 139–140) speculations on the likely growth of European real per capita GDP between 1500 and 1750 contrasted sharply with the conclusions of Phelps Brown and his disciples, but he made no reference to their work. The two major historians of the national accounting tradition, Studenski (1958) and Stone (1997) made no mention of the real wage literature. There was a fifth wave of real wage analysis in the past decade. This includes 2 articles on Asia; Feinstein, 1998, is the first rigorous and comprehensive measurement of real earnings of manual workers (1770–1870) by a historical national accountant since Bowley (1900); repair work on the second generation estimates by Robert Allen (2001), and new estimates by Jeffrey Williamson (1995) for 17 countries 1830–1988, which incorporate inter–spatial as well as inter–temporal comparisons. The articles on Asia break new ground and are discussed below. Özmucur and Pamuk (2002) present estimates of real wages of building workers in Istanbul for 1489–1914. They find a level in 1820 similar to that at the end of the fifteenth century (with some big dips in between) and about 40 per cent higher by 1910–14. They do not suggest that their measure is The World Economy: Historical Statistics 634 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 

a satisfactory proxy for per capita income, but as they have no estimates of the latter before the nineteenth century, they conclude from their evidence that the decline of the Ottoman empire in the sixteenth century was reversed, and it adapted successfully to changing circumstances from the seventeenth to the nineteenth century. Their research is well documented, their conclusions are cautious and Pamuk has also made tentative estimates for of GDP in Turkey and other parts of the Ottoman Empire back to 1820. This study throws new light on a region that has played a significant role in world history for centuries. Parthasarathi (1998), is a cross–country level comparison of weavers’ wages in South India and England in the eighteenth century. He also covers spinners and farm labourers where his evidence is much thinner. He converts weekly wages of weavers in both countries into grain units, assuming a lb of Indian rice equivalent to 1500 calories and a lb of British bread 1000 calories. In Britain weekly earnings of weavers bought 40 to 140 lbs of grain and in South India 65 to 160. He claims that labourers in South India were in a better bargaining position than their English counterparts because they operated as village collectives, appealing to even–handed political authorities in case of dispute. In England legislation prohibited combinations of workers. The article is useful in shaking up conventional views, but is certainly contestable. It may be true that individual workers in England had a weak bargaining position, but it seems likely that in Indian village “collectives” lower castes and untouchables were exploited by the brahmin elite. The sources of his Indian wage estimates are not very clear, and his assumption that British workers got their calories from wheaten loaves bought from bakeries is rather odd. They probably got quite a lot of calories from meat and potatoes, cheese and beer which were not available in south India. A good deal of their bread must have been home–baked. 

Chronology 

In surveying economic development over the last two millennia in Maddison (2001), it seemed logical to start with the year zero, as official celebrations treated the year 2000 as the beginning of a new millennium. In fact, there is no year zero in the Christian era which begins in AD 1, with I BC as the preceding year. In tables HS–8, I have bowed to convention, and substituted year 1 for year zero. This makes no difference to estimates of growth rates for the first millennium. It is perhaps useful to consider changes in conventions for measuring time over these two millennia. The Julian calendar, with an average year of 365.25 days was inaugurated by the Roman dictator, Julius Caesar in 46 BC, on the advice of the Alexandrian astronomer Sosigenes. It exaggerated the length of the year by a tiny fraction, and was replaced in the Catholic countries of Europe on October 4th 1582, as decreed in a papal bull of Gregory XIII, on advice from the astronomer Clavius and others. The Gregorian year was a little shorter (averaging of 365.2425 days). 10 days (5–14th October) were dropped from that year to link the two systems. The Protestant countries of Europe started to adopt this calendar in 1700. The last European country to switch was the USSR in 1918. England and its colonies changed over in 1752. Until then their year began with Lady Day, on 25th March. The British parliament endorsed the change in 1751, stipulating that the year would end on 31st December, and the new Gregorian year would start on 1st January. To complete the transition, 3rd to 13th September were omitted from the 1752 calendar (Wednesday 2nd September being followed by Thursday 14th). The previous anachronistic system meant that anything published from 1st January to 24th March was attributed to the preceding year. The World Economy, 1-2001 AD 635 

There have also been changes in the dating and denomination of eras. The traditional Roman era began with the foundation of Rome ( ab urbe condita) which was thought to have been in 753 BC. There was an era of the Emperor Augustus, dating from the battle of Actium in 31BC, and an era of the Emperor Diocletian dating from his accession in 284 AD. The Christian era was first proposed by Dionysius Exiguus in AD 532. He had been asked by Pope John the 1st to provide clear guidelines for calculating the date of Easter. He also suggested the creation of a Christian era to replace that of Diocletian (who martyred Christians). Dionysius believed that Christ was born in 1BC, and that the first year of the new era (anno domini) should be the following year which he called AD 1 (see Richards, pp. 106, 217–8 and 351). There was no symbol for zero in the Roman system of numeration, and the concept of zero as a number did not come to Europe until several centuries later. The Christian era does not seem to have been inaugurated by a papal bull, and did not come into general use until the eleventh century. The first author to use the concept systematically for his chronology was Bede in his 

Ecclesiastical History of the English People, completed in 731. He did not use the term anno domini, 

referring instead to a year in the era as “anno dominicae incarnationis” (see Colgrave and Mynors, 1969). In fact, there is a precedent for starting the Christian era in year zero. Gregory King in his Notebook, 

p. 4, made a comprehensive survey and forecast of world population, using the concept of anno mundi, with continuous numbering since the creation which he assumed had occurred 5630 years before 1695. He provided an alternative numbering system for years before and after Christ, with a dividing point in the year 0. He did not use the terms BC and AD, but distinguished years ante and post Christum .The World Economy: Historical Statistics 636 ISBN 92-64-02261-9 – © OECD 2006 http://dx.doi.org/10.1787/456125276116
