What Is ‘Socialized Medicine’?: A Taxonomy of Health Care Systems
=================================================================

 By Uwe E. Reinhardt May 8, 2009 6:48 am May 8, 2009 6:48 am

![Image 6: Today's Economist](https://static01.nyt.com/images/blogs_v3/economix/todays-economist.png)

_[Uwe E. Reinhardt](https://www.nytimes.com/ref/business/economy/reinhardt.ready.html) is an economics professor at Princeton._

With another “national conversation” about health reform upon us — as it is every decade or so — we will hear a lot of derisive talk about the evils of “socialized medicine.”

The term is regularly confused with “social health insurance,” which is not at all the same concept. The chart below may be helpful in appreciating the distinction.

![Image 7: INSERT DESCRIPTION](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/05/07/business/economy/reinhardt0508.jpg)Uwe E. Reinhardt

_Socialized medicine_ refers to health system in which the government owns and operates both the financing of health care and its delivery. Cell A in the chart represents socialized medicine.

_Social health insurance_, on the other hand, refers to systems in which individuals transfer their financial risk of medical bills to a risk pool to which, as individuals, they contribute taxes or premiums _based primarily on ability to pay_, rather than on how healthy or sick they are.

_Socialized medicine_ is one form of _social insurance_. More typically, however, _social insurance_ is coupled on the health-care delivery side with a mixture of government-owned facilities (e.g., municipal hospitals), private nonprofit hospitals (roughly 90 percent of all American hospital beds) or private for-profit facilities (investor-owned hospitals, private medical practices, pharmacies and so on). It follows that one cannot simply treat _social insurance_ as _socialized medicine_. In principle, one could have _social insurance_ with 100 percent private for-profit delivery facilities.

Under _private commercial insurance_, individuals also transfer the financial risk of bills for health care to a risk pool, but the premium the individual contributes to the risk pool _reflects that individual’s health status_. These premiums are, as actuaries put it, “medically underwritten” and “actuarially fair.” The risk pools under private insurance can be operated by not-for-profit or for-profit insurers. And like social insurance, private insurance typically is coupled with a mixed private and public delivery system.

In the chart, cells A, B, C jointly represent _single-payer social insurance_ — e.g., traditional [Medicare](https://archive.nytimes.com/economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/why-does-us-health-care-cost-so-much-part-iv-a-primer-on-medicare/). Cells D, E, F jointly represent _multiple-payer social insurance_ — e.g., [Medicaid Managed Care](https://www.cms.hhs.gov/MedicaidManagCare/). Cells G to L jointly represent _individually purchased private insurance_ with actuarially fair premiums. Finally, cells M, N and O represent the uninsured or the cost-sharing portion of insured persons.

In between these distinct systems falls employment-based health insurance.

Large employers typically self-insure and use private insurers only to procure health care on behalf of employees (e.g., negotiate fees with the providers of health care) and administer claims. Other employers do not self-insure and instead purchase so-called _group health insurance policies_ for all their employees jointly, as if they were one large family. The premium for a group policy is “experience rated” over the covered group of employees, which means that they reflect the average actuarial cost of all of one company’s employees.

The individual employee’s own contribution toward his or her employment-based insurance, however, is divorced from the individual’s (or the attached family’s) health status. In this sense, then, employment-based insurance could be described as “_private social insurance_,” as distinct from “_government-run social insurance._”

Former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York has exemplified the perennial confusion in this country over socialized medicine. In his ill-fated presidential bid, and subsequently as a supporter of Senator John McCain’s bid for the presidency, Mr. Giuliani routinely [decried](https://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/07/31/giuliani.democrats/index.html) as _socialized medicine_ (or “socialist”) any proposal presented by Democratic candidates, because typically the latter advocated tax-financed subsidies toward the purchase of health private insurance or expansions of public insurance programs. But technically none of them advocated _socialized medicine_.

Perhaps Mr. Giuliani was unaware that Americans all along the ideological spectrum reserve the purest form of _socialized medicine_ — the [V.A. health system](https://www.myhealth.va.gov/) — for the nation’s veterans. I find this cognitive dissonance amusing. Indeed, if socialized medicine is so evil, why didn’t Republicans privatize the V.A. health system when they controlled both the White House and the Congress during 2001-06?

Mr. Giuliani also seems to forget that, in 1996, he found _social health insurance_ a perfect solution to the financial problems faced by former Mayor John V. Lindsay, who fell on financially hard times during the 1990s as a result of chronic illness.

In a fit of compassion, then Mayor Giuliani rushed to his friend’s assistance with — you guessed it — taxpayers’ money, rather than with a private sector solution. He did so by [appointing Mr. Lindsay](https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/03/nyregion/ailing-lindsay-is-given-posts-to-get-city-health-insurance.html) to two no-show city jobs that came with tax-financed municipal health insurance and a tax-financed pension.

It seems fair, then, to ask Mr. Giuliani why it was perfectly fine to bail out a financially distressed man who had been wealthy enough in his younger years to provide adequately for his old age, when proposals to extend the same kind of assistance to hard-working, uninsured members of lower-income families are decried by him as “socialism.”

One can only hope that our members of Congress and the typical American voter can make the right distinctions.

If you look at Giuliani’s history you see that he has exempted himself and his cronies from the rules he wants others to live by. that is why he had the most corrupt mayorality since Walker.

Dr. Reinhardt,

Today’s column provides useful assistance in getting our terms straight. In a future column, please provide an overview of the incentives for providers, payors and patients under various health care financing and delivery systems.

TIE[May 8, 2009·8:32 am](https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/what-is-socialized-medicine-a-taxonomy-of-health-care-systems/#comment-34461 "Comment Permalink")

A not too small nuance in Medicare that is hard to place in your taxonomy is participation of private insurers within the single-payer framework: Medicare Advantage (MA) and stand-alone prescription drug plans (PDPs). It would be illuminating to develop the extent to which Medicare provides viable models for health reform. I’m partial to the PDP approach, especially its federal fallback option, as I’ve posted ( [//thefinancebuff.com/2009/05/the-role-for-a-public-plan.html](https://thefinancebuff.com/2009/05/the-role-for-a-public-plan.html)).

The PDP program is (at the moment) close to the structure that might arise in health reform: private plans bidding for government subsidies. It also has a means-tested component in the low-income subsidy program. With the exception of a “public plan” provided drug benefit, this isn’t too farm in design from what is currently being debated.

If competitive bidding is imposed on MA plans too, then that would be a better analog because they provide comprehensive coverage and there is a public plan “competitor” in FFS Medicare.

There seems to be some aversion (by others) to using Medicare as guidance for health reform for the non-elderly. I can see the rhetorical land mines, but I think we lose something in not trying to learn from experiments already conducted in the elderly health insurance marketplace.

I love Professor Reinhardt’s careful and lucid distinctions between the GOP baloney and the facts with regard to social health insurance.

The point about the VA is one I’ve made to intractable right-wingers for years.

They never have an answer. I usually phrase it something like this….”If Republicans love the troops so much, why do they reserve this evil and pure socialized medicine specifically and uniquely for those troops they love so muchl?

Now for the emotional part: I want to thank professor Reinhardt for having found a more genteel way than I would have, to say that Rudolph Giuliani is full of sh….well, spit !

This sort of hair-splitting is completely irrelevant. It matters not whether the government owns the hospitals and employs the doctors as they do in the UK – or if the government leaves the provision of health care to the private sector and merely pays for everything. The results are the same. Shortages and government-directed rationing.

Before the good professor jumps in with his time-worn objection that in a free market, health care is rationed by price instead of by health care administrators, let me point out that there is a huge difference. In a free market, there is something called supply-and-demand which utilizes pricing signals that cause supply to be increased and shortages to be abated. In the UK and Canada, there is none of this – only naked coercion.

The Canadians even resort to brute force, arbitrary rationing where certain medical devices can only be implanted on a one-per-month basis in some hospitals. This is where Mr. Reinhardt and others want to take us.

Kenneth[May 8, 2009·9:23 am](https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/what-is-socialized-medicine-a-taxonomy-of-health-care-systems/#comment-34471 "Comment Permalink")

What this chart shows in part is how there’s a divide betwen what we think of our personal health, which presumably is priceless, and the willingness to pay to maintain it. Most everyone is willing to pay actuarially fair rates for, say, auto insurance, because quantifying the value of a 2005 Honda is an emotionless and straightforward affair. People who speed and get into frequent accidents are charged more, and few have much sympathy for that. That’s fair; one’s demonstrably elevated risk ought not be assumed by others without a concomitant increase in rates.

But once you try to treat someone’s health, and possibly life, in the same manner the whole concept of “fair” runs smack into the assertion that one’s own health is priceless and indeed irreplaceable. At a fundamental level, unless we’re willing to change this mindset (and I’ll invite you to do so first!) actuarially fair represents a disconnect in values. It works if you can go out and replace a said 2005 Honda with another 2005 Honda down to trim levels and color. It doesn’t work if what you have is irreplaceable and not subject to replacement with a cash equivalent.

The real hypocrisy lies in the fact that we would dare not change the assumption of the distinctly non-monetary nonequivalent value of life, but pretend that we can pay the rates as if we could shop around for collision insurance. Either we have to suck it up and make health care the moral equivalent of police or fire protection and go the full hog for social insurance, or we can stop pretending that we can sustainably pay for every treatment, every procedure no matter how expensive or futile the scenario based on rates which assume that Someone Else’s Wallet is infinite while not paying for it ourselves directly.

Third party pay has caused health care cost to explode to the point where no one can pay. End third party pay and costs will revert to levels that are reasonable. Or perhaps we are too sick and need too much care, in which case, as another great economist(oxymoron) said, in the long run we are all dead….except the next generation that picks up the bill.

#9 – Actually, systems that aren’t pure single-payer (i.e. most of them) often have a parallel private system that allows those with the means to directly purchase health care or private health insurance coverage that is more generous than public coverage.

So you need not worry; if the publicly-financed system won’t provide you with the device you need, it’s likely you could still either buy it out-of-pocket, or buy private insurance that will give you access to it after all.

Landon[May 8, 2009·9:41 am](https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/08/what-is-socialized-medicine-a-taxonomy-of-health-care-systems/#comment-34477 "Comment Permalink")

I agree that many don’t understand the private/public relationship with health care in the US – as well as the various programs being offered through new legislation.

There is no doubt that the relationship between the private health care industry and the federal government over the past few decades has created numerous inefficiencies and bureaucratic waste. The problems are grossly understated by many and true health care reform centralized around these core issues would likely drastically reduce the cost of health care. I’m on the fence about many health care issues, yet there is no doubt in my mind addressing this problem should be our first priority as it could lower costs to make our corporations, small businesses, and individuals able to provide/have access to affordable health care. Maybe this isn’t all we need – but I think fixing the underlying problem is better than throwing money at the effect rather than a cause.

Medicare is also undoubtedly a big problem that will ruin us if we don’t address it yesterday – the rise of the baby boomer population along with rising costs of health care make this nearly impossible to fund in the near future. This has been a central issue for many regardless of their political affiliation. Our future financial obligations for Medicare (especially with benefit D – thanks Bush) and Social Security are a real threat to our next generation.

As an aside, the VA system has it own set of very special problems, not the least of which is that it only treats service-related injuries or maladies. It’s not a general insurer for vets, and it expends every sort of effort to bill, claim or otherwise recoup the costs of health care that’s not covered under its mission. It in a sense works because it CAN bill private insurance; it practically requires it without bankrupting the system.

A simple way to interpret the chart, eliminate options C, F, I, J, K, L, M, N & O as options. Everyone is insured be it by the US Government or from private, non-profit plans. What needs to be done is to make policies national to get a larger pool of people.Elimination of 50 health insurance boards in the states and putting this at the federal level would also cut a great deal of administration costs. This would be a great compromise and it would accomplish getting everyone insured.

How to pay for it? Eliminate individual premiums and enact a new income tax (following the existing progressive system) which would be revenue neutral to what individuals are paying now for insurance through their employers. Thus, if the average employee pays $300/month for insurance, then the tax would be approximately $300 a month. The employee can choose a plan offered by their employer, a private plan or the government, and have the tax deducted. Those who say this is a new tax are kidding themselves because the average person is paying nearly 10% of their salary for health insurance coverage. At least this way, the tax is more in the open.

I don’t think this is still quite right. Socialism refers to ownership of the means of production.

Medicare/Medicaid is a government-administered system in which the government only provides a clerical function. It collects dedicated taxes and then disburses them to private (for-profit or non-profit) service providers according to well-defined rules. The government “owns” nothing.

The VA and the NHS in the UK are the closest to true socialism. The health providers are employees of the government so the government in a sense “owns” the means of production. No one in the US is proposing a plan like this beyond the VA and, perhaps, some state-run facilities.

A universal government-administered insurance plan would cover everyone, put all the money in a single fund, but would still employ outsiders to provide the services. This is what Mass has tried to do, for example.

As long as the government isn’t hiring the workers directly it isn’t “socialism”.

I think the confusion is made worse by the use of the concept of insurance instead of care. We need universal health care, using insurance to provide it is just one technique. We have universal education, but don’t use insurance to fund it. Imagine a system where people take out insurance in case they someday have children and then this would pay for their education. When looked at this way it is clear how stupid the concept is.

With universal, guaranteed, health care as a right the same as education, much of the wasteful overhead would be eliminated. You show up, you present your ID card, you get treated. It works in Canada, perhaps someone would like to actually look at other countries to see how they are doing instead of having all these meaningless debates over imaginary problems.

The health sector employs about 16 million people, is it any wonder they are fighting so hard to maintain as much of the status quo as they can.

Stop talking about insurance and start talking about care and the right will lose its ability to mislead the public.

Obama wants to compete with private insurance. He will use tax dollars to underwrite the government plan, so that it will be impossible to compete with them, and eventually they will go away. As a community organizer he knows that incrementalism is the safest way to deliver change without everyone noticing, or having adverse political effects. I am not against all forms of socialized or government sponsored health care. If find it amusing that the writer is amused that the Republicans didn’t privatize the VA, as if that proves that their ideology is not pure. Hard political choices are rarely made by politicians of either party. But, it is amusing that a high percentage of seniors qualified for VA coverage also enroll in medicare drug coverage because the average plan has about 3 times the type of drugs that can be had under the VA plan. Of course, Obama plans to cut back the medicare plan.

 I had a cousin in Sweden who waited 2 1/2 years for a hip replacement operation, and was in brutal pain during most of that time. Cost reduction by limiting access is at the root of cost savings in most European systems and in Canada. Class warfare will be a problem if rich people can buy health care that others can’t get or can get only at some time in the future. This is the case in Canada. The rich come here to get care they don’t want to wait for because it is illegal to pay on your own in Canada.

 You will note that Obama wants to pass health care before immigration reform. Part of the reason for this is that the 45-47 million uninsured estimate is based upon census data that doesn’t differentiate between legal citizens and illegals. It only asks how long one has been in the country. According to bipartisan studies, only about 8-15 million (prior to meltdown) are americans who can’t get insurance (pre-existing conditions, etc). The rest are illegals, young adults who think they don’t need it, and those who can afford it but won’t buy it. Most Americans don’t want to insure illegals, even though they kow that they are getting free emergency room care. He will cut back on medicare in order to get this done, he just doesn’t want to tell you about it now. You must remember that during his debates with Hillary, Obama was against forcing people to buy insurance. They could wait until they were sick enough that they didn’t want to pay for treatment.

 I know that one of the biggest obstacles to any form of socialized medicine is the lack of doctors, paticularly those in general practice. The first think we need to do is increase the capacity of medical schools, and giving incentives to practice general medicine. At learst 1/2 of the doctors I see are from foreign countries, and we cannot continue to make up for our shortfalls this way.

 I am for a system that combines health care for all to a certain level, and then insurance for things not covered by the government, with the governmental subsidizing the poor. The French have a system that has these elements.

 What amuses me is that the liberals who scream the loadest about privacy see no conflict in having all of our health data in a government data base. When A-Rods drug test was leaked by a government employee (the judge is still trying to find the guilty party) it made me realize that the data in your medical file can be a weapon waiting to be used by those who don’t share your ideology. Don’t tell me the data will be safe, if your doctor can get to it anyone can.

Social Medicine is the way to go, Universal Coverage is the price of empathy, of living in a community and caring for each other. The fact that we have ignorant and arrogant individuals for whom ‘socialized’ equals evil is preposterous.

Dear Democratic Senator Baucus has refused to allow “single payer” health care advocates to participate in his recent health care insurance hearings. Had them arrested!! 15 insurance industry reps are being heard, only.

Dear Democratic Senator Baucus receives more health care and drug industry lobbyist money than any other Democrat. Me smells a rat, Mr. President…………….

Taxes for government run healthcare will stifle economic growth & kill jobs.

 Look at the British experiment for a diseased economy.

 Government healthcare decides IF you can see your Doctor, WHEN you can see your Doctor, WHERE you can see your Doctor & IFyou get your care from a nurse, not a Doctor. You lose all control. The bureaucrats take over.

 Government healthcare RATIONS your care.

 Under Uwe’s socialist healthcare you are FORCED to PAY for insurance whether you want to or not.Government mandates it.

 Your freedom to CHOOSE is taken away from you, your liberty shrunk.

 Canada is re-privatising its socialist healthcare system as it is a total mess.

 Britain’s Doctors are told what drugs to give you or withold. What treatments to ration. All by socialist government bureaucrats.You wait in lines forever for care.

 No Doctors sends their kids to med school anymore, its a wasted life working for the government.

 Vote fo the Congressman that keep your freedom & liberty to buy your own insurance – if & when, you please.

Lets take look at Massachusetts socialsized health care system. If this system was so great, why are they having so many problems?

I don’t want to have to pay for anyone else’s health insurance out of my tax dollars.

Here’s another problem no one talks about. Many doctors will not accept government sponsored plans like Medicaid, and with Medicaid, you do not have a choice of doctors the coverage is many times very limited.

Do people think that doctors will magically start accepting low paying government insurance if we have universal coverage? Think again.
