 I'm Bryan Caplan, Professor of Economics at George Mason University and _New York Times_ Bestselling author.

 I've written _The Myth of the Rational Voter_, named "the best political book of the year" by the _New York Times_, _Selfish Reasons to Have More Kids_, _The Case Against Education_, _Open Borders_ (co-authored with [SMBC's](https://www.smbc-comics.com/) Zach Weinersmith), _Build, Baby, Build_ (co-authored with Ady Branzei), _Labor Econ Versus the World_, _How Evil Are Politicians?_, _Don't Be a Feminist_, _Voters As Mad Scientists_, _You Will Not Stampede Me_, _Self-Help Is Like a Vaccine_, and _Pro-Market and Pro-Business_. I'm now finishing _Unbeatable: The Brutally Honest Case for Free Markets_.

 I am the editor and chief writer for [Bet On It](http://betonit.substack.com/), the blog hosted by the [Salem Center for Policy](https://salemcenter.org/) at the University of Texas. I've published in the _New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, TIME, Newsweek, Atlantic, American Economic Review, Economic Journal, Journal of Law and Economics,_ and _Intelligence_, [blogged for EconLog from 2005-2022](https://www.econlib.org/econlog-by-author-and-letter/?selected_letter=C#bcaplan), and appeared on ABC, BBC, Fox News, MSNBC, and C-SPAN. An openly nerdy man who loves role-playing games and graphic novels, I live in Oakton, Virginia, with my wife and four kids.
