Assessing the change in the level of Soviet welfare in the first half of the twentieth century presents many problems. There are the problems associated with the reliability and accessibility of Soviet statistics, and there are those associated with the problem of understanding the peculiar nature of the Soviet situation in which a trend toward rapid secular improvements in welfare and life expectancy were accompanied by massive shortterm welfare and mortality crises. These problems are made even more complicated by the intense politicization of this question. In this paper I address all of these problems.

There is less agreement concerning the nature of the pre-1933 data, especially the 1930–32 figures. The official viewpoint is that the previous official series were barn yields that needed no further adjustment. I claim that they were already highly inflated and consequently needed to be reduced to remain comparable with the revised lower series for 1933–60.

15. The data for 1885–1930 indicated an increase of 7.47 cm over forty-five years. The data for 1885–1935 showed an increase of 5 cm over fifty years. Hence, in the five years between 1930 and 1935 there must have been a decline of 2.47 cm.

21. For an account of how this mechanism operated in Russia during the malaria epidemics of 1924–28 and 1934–36, see Wheatcroft, _Population Dynamic_, SIPS, no. 2: 106–23.

22. Malaria has been used in the above example because we have some idea about its aetiology and the nature of its interaction. The argument that the decline in malaria (archaic “aigue “) in Europe was of far greater significance than normally accepted was made in Buer, M., Health, Wealth and Population in the Early Days of the Industrial Revolution (1926; reprint, London, 1968)[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Health%2C+Wealth+and+Population+in+the+Early+Days+of+the+Industrial+Revolution&author=Buer+M.&publication+year=1968). Although Buer presents an interesting line of argument, the argument I present here does not rely on malaria or any currently identified mechanism and disease. There are some complexities in life that we have not yet understood.

24. Alain Blum, however, denies that this is the case and argues that the French data show a differentiation in life expectancy for different social classes that is observable over time.

26. It is pardy for this reason that I have been attracted to looking at the scale and effects of famines and other disasters in Russia. My article “Crises and die Condition of the Peasantry in Late Imperial Russia,” in Esther Kingston-Mann and Timothy Mixter, eds., _Peasant Economy, Culture, and Politics of European Russia, 1800–1921_ (Princeton, 1991), 128–74, was concerned with explaining the differences between agricultural crises, crises in peasant living standards, and agrarian crises, and offering some indicators to assist in understanding diese differences. Steven Hoch, who was looking for evidence of a relationship between secular trends in local welfare and local mortality, appears to have totally misunderstood this point in his article criticizing my work. Hoch, Steven, “On Good Numbers and Bad: Malthus, Population Trends and Peasant Standard of Living in Late Imperial Russia,” Slavic Review 53, no. 1 (Spring 1994): 41–75.[CrossRef](https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2500325)[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=On+Good+Numbers+and+Bad%3A+Malthus%2C+Population+Trends+and+Peasant+Standard+of+Living+in+Late+Imperial+Russia&author=Hoch+Steven&publication+year=1994&journal=Slavic+Review&volume=53&doi=10.2307%2F2500325&pages=41-75)

27. Alain Blum has kindly pointed out to me tiiat altiiough mortality is terminal for the individual, as a social phenomenon, it could experience these compensation effects, or their opposite. It has often been argued drat a selection process may operate, whereby the survivors of mortality crises would be stronger than the victims, and that consequently die generation of stronger survivors would have compensatory longevity. But the opposite is also possible, and Blum, Avdeev, and Zakharov have argued that the Russian generation born during World War II is demonstrably weaker than all other generations. See Blum, A. and Zakharov, S., “L'histoire demographique de l'URSS et de la Russie a travers l'histoire des generations,” Naselenie i obshchestvo (Population et société), February 1997, no. 17: 4.[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Blum,+A.+and+Zakharov,+S.,+%E2%80%9CL%27histoire+demographique+de+l%27URSS+et+de+la+Russie+a+travers+l%27histoire+des+generations,%E2%80%9D+Naselenie+i+obshchestvo+(Population+et+soci%C3%A9t%C3%A9),+February+1997,+no.+17:+4.)

28. This terminology is taken from R. H. Steckel. “Height at a particular age reflects an individual's history of _net_ nutrition. The body devotes a substantial share of food to maintenance, and work or physical activity and disease make other claims on the diet… analyses of stature must recognize not only inputs to health such as diet and medical care but also work effort and related phenomena such as labour organization. Similarly, researchers must attempt to understand ways that exposure to infectious disease may have placed claims on the diet.” R. H. Steckel, “Stature and the Standard of _Living,” Journal of Economic Literature_ 33 (December 1995): 1910–11. It is possible that “net nutrition” could also be influenced by differences in human responses to the epidemiological environment, and that in certain environments these epidemiological factors could predominate over normal nutritional ones. In this regard “net nutrition” may be a little misleading and may in fact have very little to do with nutrition at all. For this reason, I will always present this phrase in quotation marks.

29. The body mass indicator (BMI) is the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters.

30. Unlike mortality indicators, anthropometric indicators do normally provide more obviously favorable data for privileged groups in the population.

31. These two exclude anthropometric data, which are often considered nutrition indicators and which will be considered separately below.

40. The exact scale of the correction needed is the cause of some dispute. I am not alone in challenging the reliability of the corrections to Soviet mortality and natality data applied by Andreev, E. M., Darskii, L. E., and Khar'kova, T.

49. This would tend to support die claims of those scholars who maintain that the famine of 1891–92 was not as serious as often presented, that the tsarist relief measures were extremely effective (see Robbins, R. G., Famine in Russia, 1891–2: The Imperial Government Responds to Crisis [New York, 1975][Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Famine+in+Russia%2C+1891%E2%80%932%3A+The+Imperial+Government+Responds+to+Crisis&author=Robbins+R.+G.&publication+year=1975)), and that the leap in mortality in 1892 was largely a result of the cholera epidemic of die summer of 1892, rather than die famine of 1891–92.

G., “The 1891/2 Famine in Russia: Towards a More Detailed Analysis of Its Scale and Demographic Significance,” in Edmondson, L. and Waldron, P., eds., Economy and Society in Russia and the Soviet Union, 1860–1930: Essays for Olga Crisp (New York, 1992), 44–64.[CrossRef](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-349-22433-3_4)[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?title=Economy+and+Society+in+Russia+and+the+Soviet+Union%2C+1860%E2%80%931930%3A+Essays+for+Olga+Crisp&author=Wheatcroft+S.+G.&author=Edmondson+L.&author=Waldron+P.&publication+year=1992&pages=44-64)

52. The data show furdier declines down to 163.9 cm in 1909, but since the 1909 cohort would only have been 18 in 1927, these figures are likely to be nonterminal heights.

58. Age-specific mortality tables exhibit a sharp “U” shape which reflects this.

59. In the simplest of terms, societies with high birth rates will normally have a larger proportion of children than those with low birth rates and will normally have higher mortality rates because young children die more frequently than pre-old-age adults.

61. This applies particularly to Lancaster who devotes 5.5 pages to France and .5 pages to the Faeroe Islands, but only 2 lines to die USSR. Russia is not featured among the twenty-one countries whose crude death rates are included in the summary table on page 36, the fourteen countries whose age-specific mortalities are listed in a table on pages 30–31, or the seventeen countries whose age-specific mortality over time appear in a table on page 394.

62. Abortion was introduced as a health measure (to remove unwanted pregnancies and unwanted children) in 1918. It had taken on mass significance by 1924. It was banned by the authorities, for all but a limited number of medical complaints in 1936, and was only reintroduced after Stalin's death in the 1950s. See Wheatcroft, _Population Dynamic_, SIPS, no. 1: 53.
