When German officials began their efforts to integrate 17 million former East Germans into the West following four decades of Communism, American diplomats and economists hoped to do likewise with over 140 million Russians, spread over seven time zones, after seven decades of Communism. The Germans will likely succeed, but it has been a much harder task than they originally envisioned. The Americans have failed. Seventy years of history's most comprehensive totalitarianism, following centuries of absolutism, left an institutional and moral void that -- compounded by the suddenness of the Soviet collapse -- has so far proved impossible to overcome. ''So great is Russia's economic and thus social catastrophe that we must now speak of another unprecedented development: the literal demodernization of a 20th-century country,'' writes Stephen F. Cohen, professor of Russian studies at New York University, in ''Failed Crusade.''

Even before Russia's financial collapse of August-September, 1998, in which Western investors lost tens of billions of dollars, Russia's gross domestic product was half of what it had been in the early 1990's: twice the decline of the United States economy during the Great Depression. Cohen blames bad advice from the United States for the debacle, and his terse, blistering polemic assails the entire community of Russia experts who, he claims, ''committed malpractice throughout the 1990's.''
