The Republican VP nominee claims Hayek as hero. Did he miss the libertarian economist's advocacy of universal healthcare?

> Where, as in the case of sickness and accident, neither the desire to avoid such calamities nor the efforts to overcome their consequences are as a rule weakened by the provision of assistance – where, in short, we deal with genuinely insurable risks – the case for the state's helping to organize a comprehensive system of social insurance is very strong.

Surprisingly, those are the words of Friedrich Hayek, straight out of The Road to Serfdom. And I'm not pulling them out of context: Hayek firmly believed that the government should organize comprehensive systems of social insurance, including health care; should protect citizens against poverty and should ensure, for everyone, "the certainty of a given minimum of sustenance for all".

With vice-presidential candidate Paul Ryan claiming that [his ideas are inspired by Hayek](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/magazine/prime-time-for-paul-ryans-guru-the-one-thats-not-ayn-rand.html) and even handing out copies of The Road to Serfdom "[to bring new staffers up to speed](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80235.html)" – following the earlier highjacking of Hayek by [Glenn Beck](http://www.abebooks.com/blog/index.php/2010/06/09/glenn-beck-sends-road-to-serfdom-onto-bestseller-lists/) and [Rush Limbaugh](http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2012/02/10/romney_attempts_to_display_his_severe_conservatism_at_cpac) – it's time for some intellectual honesty.

Others have usefully begun to discuss [the tension between Paul Ryan's politics and Hayek's thought](http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/28/why-hayek-isnt-paul-ryans-guru/), as well as the internal tensions between Hayek and Ryan's other guru, [Ayn Rand](http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0812/80235.html). But here, for a moment, let's go back to the primary text, open our [University of Chicago Press definitive edition of The Road to Serfdom](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/R/bo4138549.html) and honestly read it in relation to the American healthcare debate.

By way of background, Hayek was adamant that the central economic function of government is to organize and administer markets in such a way as to promote and protect competition. His central focus was on the neutrality of government rules – or what he called (on p117), "the Rule of Law, in the sense of the rule of formal law, the absence of legal privileges of particular people designated by authority" – not the elimination of government rules:

> "The liberal argument is in favor of making the best possible use of the forces of competition as a means of coordinating human efforts, not an argument for leaving things just as they are." (p85)

Hayek emphasized that it is a pure and simple – and highly misleading – mischaracterization of his own thought, and of liberal economic theory, to suggest that government should do nothing. "In no system that could be rationally defended would the state just do nothing", he stressed in The Road to Serfdom (p88).

In this sense, Hayek firmly believed that the notion of a "free market" is an illusion:

> "The question whether the state should or should not 'act' or 'interfere' poses an altogether false alternative, and the term 'laissez faire' is a highly ambiguous and misleading description of the principles on which a liberal policy is based. Of course, every state must act and every action of the state interferes with something or other." (p118)

The key question for Hayek was whether the government rules are unbiased. Not that there be no rules, but that they be predictable and neutral – that they not favor the elites. So, for instance:

> "[W]ith respect to most of the general and permanent rules which the state may establish with regard to production, such as building regulations or factory laws: these may be wise or unwise in the particular instance, but they do not conflict with liberal principles so long as they are intended to be permanent and are not used to favor or harm particular people." (p118)

Hayek's general theory of government was complex, and I am by no means a defender or a disciple. Personally, I believe that Hayek irrationally clung to a notion of natural order – what he called "spontaneous order" – that blinded him to the humanly-constructed nature of the wealth distributions that occur under conditions that he called "competitive". As a result, Hayek himself fell in the cold war trap, instead of working out the full implications of his own economic theory. Hayek made naturalistic assumptions in the economic realm – about the naturalness of skill and talent, and about natural order – that belong in churches and temples, not in political economy.

But one thing is clear: as applied to the more specific issue of healthcare, Hayek favored a robust notion of security that included "security against severe physical privation" and "the certainty of a given minimum of sustenance for all" (p147). Hayek was adamant about this. "There is no reason why in a society which has reached the general level of wealth which ours has attained," Hayek wrote, on the next page. "[This] kind of security should not be guaranteed to all without endangering general freedom." He continued, "there can be no doubt that some minimum of food, shelter, and clothing, sufficient to preserve health and the capacity to work, can be assured to everybody." And for Hayek, this extended to healthcare:

> "Nor is there any reason why the state should not assist the individuals in providing for those common hazards of life against which, because of their uncertainty, few individuals can make adequate provision."

Hayek recognized that the provision of healthcare is complex and that we may disagree as to the exact structure of the assistance necessary:

> "But there is no incompatibility in principle between the state's providing greater security in this way and the preservation of individual freedom." (p148)

Hayek did not subscribe, in his own words, to a "dogmatic laissez faire attitude" (p85). He believed in rules "to limit working hours or to require certain sanitary arrangements", and believed they were "fully compatible with the preservation of competition" (p86). He added on the next page:

> "Nor is the preservation of competition incompatible with an extensive system of social services – so long as the organization of these services is not designed in such a way as to make competition ineffective over wide fields."

I could go on, but I sense you've gotten my point by now. It's important to read a thinker like Friedrich Hayek closely and honestly – never to idolize, nor to simplify and certainly never to highjack. Equally important, I believe, is to keep a critical perspective, to identify their hidden assumptions, to challenge them when they take a leap of faith. There would be a lot more to say about that and much to contest in Hayek – but it would have to start, at a minimum, from an honest and close reading.

For now, I propose that we close with another interesting passage:

> "Wherever communal action can mitigate disasters against which the individual can neither attempt to guard himself nor make provision for the consequences, such communal action should undoubtedly be taken." (p148)

I hope that staffers from both presidential campaigns will ponder those words. It would actually militate in favor of more universal healthcare than the Affordable Health Care Act now provides.

At this unsettling time
-----------------------

We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could spare 37 seconds to support our most important fundraising appeal of the year.

In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year on from his second victory, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one.

From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced.

While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts.

While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel.

**Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less.**

**But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, it means we’ll show you fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you.**

I am not a big fan of Hayek I must say but the basic points here you would think nearly everyone could agree on?

1. Markets can and indeed do provide efficient feedback mechanisms for determining prices and delivering goods and services. 

2. Markets can however become flawed and there are some things that whilst being to the benefit of all are not going to be provided to everybody by the market. It doesn't matter if some people can't afford the market price for a car or television but if people can't afford the market price to educate their kids, or health care if they get sick or if a community can't afford the market price for street lighting road repairs etc then this is a problem.

Healthcare takes us to the bottom line of the debate. There are very few of us can afford the market price of long term health care for serious illness especially because serious illness tends to reduce your income. So we either have some form of collective provision or we let people that can't afford the market price die. Between 1845 and 1852 over a million people were allowed to die in Ireland because they couldn't afford the market price for food, following potato blight, throughout this period food continued to be exported from Ireland. A million more, ironically including Paul Ryan's ancestors, were forced to leave. There is a story that Sir Randoph Routh who was the head of the Irish Relief Commission was visited by a delegation desperately seeking help instead of giving them food he issued them with copies of a pamphlet by Edmund Burke which explained how market forces deliver food more efficiently than the government!

Hayek actually makes his position on this much better in "Law, Legislation and Liberty" which he wrote much later than "Road to Serfdom":

[](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eMk9AAAAIAAJ&q=that+where+the+market+can+be+made+to+supply+the+services+required+it+is+the+most+effective+method+of+doing+so+does+not+imply#v=onepage&q&f=false)

> [The contention that where the market can be made to supply the services required it is the most effective method of doing so does not imply that we may not resort to other methods where the former is not applicable. Nor can it be seriously questioned that where certain services can be provided only if all beneficiaries are made to contribute to their costs, because they cannot be confined to those to pay for them, only the government should be entitled to use such coercive powers.](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eMk9AAAAIAAJ&q=that+where+the+market+can+be+made+to+supply+the+services+required+it+is+the+most+effective+method+of+doing+so+does+not+imply#v=onepage&q&f=false)

Whatever else you think of Hayek his ideas on the role of the state are much more positive and humane than the so called libertarians, the modern day version of Sir Randoph Rouths, who on the one hand tell us tax is robbery with the threat of violence and then use this as an argument to say that the role of the state should be limited to a monopoly over the use of force so that they can keep us all under control!
