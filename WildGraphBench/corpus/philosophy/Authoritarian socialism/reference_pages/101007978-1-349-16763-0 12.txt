# Critical Sociology and Authoritarian  State  Socialism ANDREW  ARATO 

Jiirgen Habermas has demonstrated the possibility in the West of a process of democratisation that shows the limits of technocratic rationalisation of polity and economy. Moreover, he has done this (however tentatively) while presenting advanced capitalism as a framework of political and cultural instabilities, potentially crisis- and conflict-laden. It is thus that he has reconstructed Marxism as a critical sociology. However, he has not 

systematically addressed the problem of the relationship of a Marxist critical sociology to those societies that use a version of Marxism as their 'ideology' of legitimation. While it is not necessarily his task or that of his co-workers to produce a theory of the so-called socialist societies, it is nevertheless fair to ask if those approaches and concepts of his that have universal aspiration contribute to such a critical theory. For today most inherited Marxist theory, from Engels and Plekhanov to Lenin and Trotsky (and even Lukacs, Gramsci and Sartre), is either powerless in the face of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, or worse even contributes to their legitimation. In this essay I shall attempt to investigate the possible uses of Starn berg critical sociology for the study of these societies. To begin with, I shall show  (Part  I) that the problem of state-socialist society is not completely absent from Habermas's critical theory. Indeed, it will be possible to derive  (Part  II) the principle of organisation of state-socialist society from some clues in his works and those of his colleague, Claus  Offe.  Next, using concepts from the Starnberg theory of capitalist development, I shall argue  (Part  III) that the inherent crisis tendencies of state-socialist societies can be 'managed' in the long run only if, on the level of system integration, there is a transition from a high level of penetration of the social spheres by the political institutional core (positive subordination) to a lower level of penetration (negative sub-ordination). I shall try to show  (Part  IV) that negative subordination is possible only if, within the political sphere, a relative 'uncoupling' or 'disjunctivity' of political and administrative functions can be achieved; but that this disjunctivity can be protected against tendencies threatening the

Finally, using the Soviet case, I shall claim  (Part  V) that the eclectic ideological mixture promoted in the administered public sphere can perform its function of legitimating the existing system only through some combination of econo-mic success and activation of meanings rooted in the cultural life-world. The activation of meanings has hitherto proceeded in two directions: under the influence of legal development and under the revival of traditions and traditionalism. While the development of legality might threaten the stabilisation of the existing organisational principle even on the basis of negative subordination, the process of 'retraditionalisation' points in a conservative direction: the reinforcement of a relatively high degree of positive subordination.

will be outside the methodological limits of this essay to determine whether a combination of these two tendencies can indefinitely support some version of a 'dual state' in the different state-socialist countries.

Habermas never completely neglected the study of European social formations of the Soviet type. First of all they form, negatively, part of the background against which he has always sought to situate himself. His conception of Marxism (his critique of all objectivism and reductionism, and of the fetishism of technical development) and his concept of Praxis as

enlightenment and discourse (which led him to a critique of the Leninist-Lukacsian theory of organisation) have blocked the way towards two of the major factors necessary for the Soviet-type synthesis: the core ideological and institutional structures. I do believe that this consequence was intended. Furthermore, from the very beginning his reconstruction of Marxism has sought to make possible a thoroughly autonomous treatment of what was formerly relegated to the superstructure (politics and culture), with the unintended consequence that the two other major factors neces-sary for the genesis and reproduction of Soviet society (the heritage of the bureaucratic state and of cultural traditionalism) could now become accessible to analysis. This means in principle a break with those elements of classical Marxist theory which confront the Soviet Union with the bad alternative of unintended apology and theoretical impotence. What I shall try to show is that this openness in principle can be maintained within the framework of Habermas's late social theory, in particular within the context of his crisis theory of advanced societies. As far as I can tell, the problem of the analysis and evaluation of Soviet and East European societies appears four times in Habermas's work. I should like to indicate these briefly in chronological order. (1) In the important essay 'Between  Philosophy  and Science: Marxism as Critique' (1960) the Russian revolution and the establishment of the Soviet system are characterised as perhaps the most important of four fun-
