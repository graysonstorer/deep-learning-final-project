In _Red Hangover_ Kristen Ghodsee examines the legacies of twentieth-century communism twenty-five years after the Berlin Wall fell. Ghodsee's essays and short stories reflect on the lived experience of postsocialism and how many ordinary men and women across Eastern Europe suffered from the massive social and economic upheavals in their lives after 1989. Ghodsee shows how recent major crises—from the Russian annexation of Crimea and the Syrian Civil War to the rise of Islamic State and the influx of migrants in Europe—are linked to mistakes made after the collapse of the Eastern Bloc when fantasies about the triumph of free markets and liberal democracy blinded Western leaders to the human costs of "regime change." Just as the communist ideal has become permanently tainted by its association with the worst excesses of twentieth-century Eastern European regimes, today the democratic ideal is increasingly sullied by its links to the ravages of neoliberalism. An accessible introduction to the history of European state socialism and postcommunism, _Red Hangover_ reveals how the events of 1989 continue to shape the world today.

### Praise

“Kristen Ghodsee courageously confronts the liberal triumphalism that refuses to learn from seventy years of state socialism, acknowledge the tragic human costs of forced privatization, or recognize the gross inequities of capitalism. Her brilliant essays and stories provide a potent allegory of our present condition: the real cost of the continued demonization of socialism is democracy.” - Jodi Dean, author of _Democracy and Other Neoliberal Fantasies: Communicative Capitalism and Left Politics_

"Our 'post-factual' present is a moment of crisis, which renders it all the more crucial that scholars with deep knowledge of Eastern Europe be able to write for a wide audience. Kristen Ghodsee does this unusually well, with a good sense of pitch, appealing self-awareness, and the ability to conjure up the perfect ironic phrase. Her central argument is very provocative: Fukuyama’esque Western triumphalism has led us to the present catastrophic state of Europe—and perhaps of the United States of America as well. In my opinion the apocalyptic epilogue is fantastically cast—in part because I share the author’s creepy Weimaresque feeling. I hope she is wrong, but I fear she is right." - Marci Shore, author of _The Taste of Ashes: The Afterlife of Totalitarianism in Eastern Europe_

"A banquet of a book, full of unexpected dishes.... Ghodsee writes with moral seriousness and exceptional force, and _Red Hangover_ is the rare academic book that is compulsively readable and thoroughly compelling." - Patrick Iber, _Los Angeles Review of Books_

"I have read and loved all Ghodsee's books, each one more than the last. _Red Hangover_ is the most complex, melding personal and professional experience with history and political theory...." - Deena Stryker, _OpEd News_

"Ghodsee is an amazingly subtle and nuanced ethnographer...." - Maria Todorova, _Current History_

"This is an extraordinary book . . . Different genres are employed to great effect, offering a multidimensional view of the postcommunist world. . . . A real contribution to the re-narration of European history after 1989." - Wim de Jong, _H-Socialisms, H-Net Reviews_

"Kristen Ghodsee wrote _Red Hangover_ for the nonexpert, especially for the student born after 1989 who is trying to make sense of the present. The truly broad readership I can envision for this book, however, encompasses not only young people but rather anyone concerned about the fate of democracy." - Adrienne J. Cohen, _American Ethnologist_

"_Red Hangover_ is a brave book, one that brims with urgency concerning the current state of the world and the possibilities for improving it—possibilities that are enhanced, she believes, by taking the communist experience seriously. In short, she makes the study of eastern Europe, both under socialism and after it, crucial in effort to envisage a more viable future." - Katherine Verdery, _Slavic Review_

"_Red Hangover_ is an instructive introductory reading for everyone trying to understand the global postsocial-ist condition." - Dora Komnenovic, _Sudosteuropa_

"Surveying the present friction, the gripping essays and captivating short-fiction that comprise this infinitely accessible volume, _Red Hangover_ opens up an important space for considering how the history, ideals, and experiences of twentieth century socialism can (and should) inform mainstream efforts at retooling the present and reimagining potential futures. . . . _Red Hangover_ provides a clear, creative and gripping window onto the key processes and debates shaping everyday life in the post-Cold War era. The book makes for essential reading for undergraduates in anthropology, history, and European studies as well as readers beyond the classroom setting who are interested in cultivating a more critical understanding of a tumultuous present." - Bruce O’Neill, _Studies of Transition States and Societies_

“_Red Hangover_ provides an immensely valuable contribution to the literature on post-socialist futures and critiques of liberal democracies. . . . With its creative and engaging writing style, _Red Hangover_ is an empowering book for those of us who feel estranged and cast aside by the looming darkness.”

 - Sinan Dogan, _Anthropology Book Forum_
