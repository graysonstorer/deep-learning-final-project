### Abstract

The aim of WESS 2017 is to document the intellectual influence of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) through its flagship publication, World Economic and Social Survey (WESS) on its 70th Anniversary. First published in 1948, the Survey is the oldest continuous post-World War II publication of its kind that records and analyses the performance of the global economy and social development trends as well as offers relevant policy recommendations. WESS 2017 will highlight how well the Survey tracked global economic and social conditions, and how its analysis influenced and were influenced by the prevailing discourse during the past seven decades. It will also critically reflect on its policy recommendations and their influence on actual policy-making and the shaping of the world economy. Particular attention will be given to reflect on the lessons that a historical review of the policy analysis done by the Survey would provide for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

##### Trends and Policies in the World Economy

 Author: United Nations   [More Less](https://doi.org/10.18356/8310f38c-en#)Authoritative and reliable, the Survey is a detailed assessment of the state of the world’s economic and social situation. Its forecasts for the upcoming year and lucid description of national and international economic policies, emerging issues and trends make it ideal for those engaged in international trade. As a special focus in this year’s edition, the Survey addresses four long-term issues of importance to the international community: the economics of the resurgent global tuberculosis crisis, how the international arms trade has changed since the end of the Cold War, recent trends in international travel as a dimension of world economic integration and prospects for global emissions of CO2 under different outlooks for policy and technical change.

##### Trends and Policies in the World Economy

 Author: United Nations   [More Less](https://doi.org/10.18356/8310f38c-en#)The World Economic and Social Survey is the United Nations annual analysis of current developments in the world economy and emerging policy issues. It contains forecast of short-term global and regional economic trends and reviews major developments in international trade. Part One of this year’s Survey revolves around the economic recovery that is underway in some developed market economies and some developing countries. Part Two explores current social issues that are interlinked with economic development. Special attention is given to public-private cooperation in the light of drastic transformation of the role of the government. The Survey includes statistical tables, which give standardized data on international trade and finance, incorporating current data and forecasts. It is essential for decision makers in government and business, and provides valuable information to all interested in the trends of global economy.

##### Climate Change Resilience - An Opportunity for Reducing Inequalities

 Author: United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs   [More Less](https://doi.org/10.18356/8310f38c-en#)This edition of the World Economic and Social Survey contributes to the debate on the implementation challenges of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In addressing the specific challenge of building resilience to climate change, the Survey focuses attention on the population groups and communities that are disproportionately affected by climate hazards. It argues that, in the absence of transformative policies which coherently address the economic, social and environmental dimensions of development, building climate resilience will remain elusive and poverty and inequalities will worsen. To the extent that the differential impact of climate hazards on people and communities is determined largely by the prevalence of multiple inequalities in respect of the access to resources and opportunities, policies aimed at building climate resilience provide an opportunity to address the structural determinants of poverty and inequality in their multiple dimensions.

##### Development in an Ageing World — 60th Anniversary Edition, 1948-2007

 Author: United Nations   [More Less](https://doi.org/10.18356/8310f38c-en#)The World Economic and Social Survey 2007 analyses the challenges and opportunities associated with ageing populations and aims to facilitate discussions in furthering the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing which focuses on three sets of priorities: older people and development; advancing health and well-being into old age; and enabling and supportive environments for older persons. The Survey underscores the need to fully recognize and better harness the productive and social contributions to societies that older persons can make but are, in many instances, prevented from making.

##### Retooling Global Development

 Author: United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs   [More Less](https://doi.org/10.18356/8310f38c-en#)The Survey points out promising directions for reform, including strengthening government capacities for formulating and implementing national development strategies; doing more to ensure that official development assistance is aligned with national priorities; strengthening the international trade and financial systems so that countries with limited capabilities can successfully integrate into the global economy; creating new mechanisms for dealing with deficiencies, such as specialized multilateral frameworks through which to govern international migration and labour mobility, international financial regulation, multinational corporations and global value chains regulation, as well as sovereign debt workouts. Most importantly, the Survey highlights the need for a strong mechanism for global economic coordination which establishes coherence across all areas of global economic governance.
