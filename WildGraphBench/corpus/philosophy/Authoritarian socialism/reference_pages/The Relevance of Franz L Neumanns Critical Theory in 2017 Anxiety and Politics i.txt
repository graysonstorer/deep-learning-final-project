Abstract: This articles discusses and contextualises tripleC ’s republication of Franz L. Ne u-

mann’s essay Anxiety and Politics . It provides some background information on Neu mann’s 

life and works. The essay ascertains that in the age of new nationalisms, rising right -wing 

authoritarianism and a uthoritarian capitalism, Franz L Neumann’s works can help us to crit i-

cally understand contemporary so ciet y.

Keywords: Franz L. Neumann , critical theory, authoritarian capitalism, right -wing authoritar i-

anism, political theory, political economy, political p sychology, psychoanalysis, ideology cr i-

1. Who W as Franz Leopold Neumann? 1

Franz Leopold N eumann (1900 -1954) was a German, Jewish political theorist ass o-

ciated with the Frankfurt School. He was born in Kattowitz /Katowice . He was part of 

the left wing of the German Social Democratic Party SPD. Neumann was influential 

in the organisation of the So cialist Students in Frankfurt and participated in the 1918 

November revolution. He received training in legal studies in Breslau, Frankfurt, 

Leipzig and Rostoc k. He obtained a doctoral degree in legal studies at the University 

of Frankfurt with the dissertation A Legal -Philosophical Introduction to A Treatise on 

the Relationship between the State and Punishment (Neumann 1923 ). After that, he 

worked as assistant of Hugo Sinzheimer, who was a professor of legal studies at 

Frankfurt University. Neumann was a practicing advocate who specialised in labour 

law. In 1927, Neumann together with Ernst Fraenkel started a lawyer’s office in Be r-

lin. They both worked for trade unions : Neumann specialised on legal cases for the 

construction workers’ union, Fraenkel’s focused on support for the metal workers’ 

union. Neumann became the German Social Democrat ic Party’s main legal advisor 

at a time when the Nazis and Hitler gained s trength in Germany. When Hitler came to 

power in 1933, the legal office had to be closed. Neumann had to flee from Germany 

and went to London, where he started studying political science and sociology at the 

London School of Economics (LSE). 

At the LSE, N eumann held a PhD scholarship and worked under the guidance of 

Harold Laski and Karl Mannheim on a second dissertation. As a result, he in 1936 

obtained his second doctoral degree with the work The Governance of the Rule of 

Law (Neumann 1936b). He moved to New York in 1936, where he became a me m-

ber of the Institute of Social Research (also known as the “Frankfurt School”) that

was then in exile in the USA and associated with Columbia University. In 1942, he 

started working for the Office of Strategic Servic e (OSS), where he together with 

Herbert Marcuse and Otto Kirchheimer analysed Nazi Germany. After the War, he 

contributed to writing indictments in the Nuremberg trials. Neumann stayed in the 

USA. In 1948, he was appointed professor of political science at Columbia University. 

He died in 1954 in a car accident. 

Alfons Söllner (2001) distinguishes three periods in Neumann’s wo rks and life: 

1) the Weimar period up until 1933 when he had to flee from Nazi Germany; 

2) the time of the Nazi regime and the Second World War (1933 -1945); 

3) the post -war time until Neumann’s death in 1954. 

It is “Neumann’s unusual tripartite course – his path fro m legal practice via co n-

frontation with Nazism to political science – which is of general significance” (Söllner 

2001, 123). In the Weimar phase, Neumann focused on legal practice and theory. 

The time of the Nazi regime and the Second World War was according to Söllner 

(2001, 125) Neumann’s most materialistic phase. Neumann certai nly was always a 

materialist thinker, but this phase, in which he wrote and published Behemoth , ce r-

tainly was one, where he heavily engaged with and made use of Marxist theory. In 

the post -war year s, Neumann contributed to the establishment of political sc ience as 

a field in general and West German political science, an d he also worked o n found a-

tions and various elements of a theory of modern dictatorship (Söllner 2001, 131). In 

the third phase, Neumann increasingly combined political theory, the materialis t the o-

ry of alienation, and political psychology. Anxiety and Politics , the essay that tripleC 

repub lishes in 2017, was written during Neumann’s third phase. 

2. Behemoth : Franz Neumann’s Analysis of the Structure and Practice of th e

Economy, the State and Ideology in Nazi Germany 

Neumann’s (2009 /1944 ) main book is Behemoth: The Structure and Practice of N a-

tional Socialism, 1933 – 1944. It was first published in 1942. Neumann brought out 

an updated and expanded version in 1944. Herbe rt Marcuse (1941, 410) writes that 

Neumann’s book shows that the “roots of Fascism are traceable to the antagonisms 

between growing industrial monopolization and the democratic system”. 

One of the book’s basic hypotheses is that Nazism is not a state, but a form of po-

liti cal violence that Neumann based on Thomas Hobbes terms the Behemoth. Ne u-

mann argues that Nazism repealed the rule of law and substituted it by irrationality. 

“Behemoth, which depicted England during the Long Parliament, was intended as the 

representation of a non -state, a situation characterized by complete lawlessness” 

(Neumann 2009 /1944 , 459). For Neumann, Nazism was a lawless and irrational 

monster that he termed the Behemoth. 

Peter Hayes arg ues in the book’s introduction: 

“L ike the Behemoth in Jewish mythology and the writings of Thomas Hobbes, 

Hitler’s regime was a chaotic, lawless, and amorphous monster. Its policies e x-

pressed the sometimes overlapping and some times contending drives of the 

four symbiotic but separate power ce nters (the Nazi party, the German state b u-

reaucracy, the armed forces, and big business) that composed it. Both the 

enormous might and the inherent vulnerability of Nazi Germany stemmed, a c-

cording to Neumann, from its very nature as a conspiracy among thes e four 

self -interested groups, each of which sought to expand German power and terr i-

tory without ceding authority or status to any of the other parties” (Neumann tripleC 15(2): 637 -650 , 2017

2009/1944, vii). 

In European Trade Unionism and Politics , Neumann (1936b, 85) defines fascis m as 

“dictatorship of the fascist (National Socialist) party, the bureaucracy, the army and 

big business – dictatorship over the whole of the people, for the complete organiz a-

tion of the nation for imperialist war”. Neumann here identifies some core charac teri s-

tics of fascism: 

1) Fascism is based on authoritarian leadership; 

2) Fascism is nationalist; it propagates that “employers and workers work together in 

perfect harmony” (39) although class society and the division of la bour continue to 

exist 

3) Fascism is a dictatorial form of capitalism; 

4) Fascism uses militaristic means (such as war, terro rism, and imperialism). 

A feature that is missing is that 5) fascism uses the friend -enemy scheme for cr e-

ating imagined enemies and scapegoats in order to distract from social problem’s 

foundations in class inequality and power asymmetries. In Behemoth , Neumann 

worked out the critical theory of fascism in more detail. 

Neumann argues that Nazism consists of fo ur groups all functioning based on the 

leadership principle: monopoly capital, the party, the military, and bureaucracy. 

“Under National Socialism, however, the whole of the society is organized in 

four solid, centralized groups, each operating under the leadership principle, 

each with a legislative, administrative, and judicial power of its own. Neither un i-

versal law nor a rationally operating bureaucracy is necessary for integration. 

Compromises among the four authoritarian bodies need not be expressed in a 

legal document nor must they be institutionalized (like the ‘gentlemen’s agre e-

ments’ between monopolistic industries). It is quite sufficient that the leadership 

of the four wings agree informally on a certain policy. The four totalitarian bo d-

ies will then enforce it with the machinery at their disposal. There is no need for 

a state standing above all groups; the state may even be a hindrance to the 

compromises and to domination over the ruled classes. The decisions of the 

Leader are merely the result of the compromises among the four leaderships” 

(Neumann 2009 /1944 , 468 -469). 

Friedrich Pollock (1941a, 1941b) argues that Nazism was a totalitarian state capita l-

ism, where “the profit motive is superseded by the power motive” (1941b, 207) and 

that it was based on the “masochistic submission to all kinds of commands, to suffe r-

ing, sacrifice, or death” (1941a, 449). Totali tarian state capitalism would have been a

new order that suc ceeded private capitalism (450). “The recognition of an economic 

sphere into which the state shaIl not and cannot intrude, so essential for the era of 

private capitalism, is being radicaIly repudiated. In consequence, execution of the 

program is enforced by state power and nothing essential is left to the functioning of 

laws of the market or other economic ‘laws.’ The primacy of politics over economics, 

so much disputed under democracy, is clearly established” (Pollo ck 1941a, 453). 

Max Horkheimer (1940, 1941) followed Pollock’s state capitalism approach, although 

he more foregrounde d aspects of ideology and instrumental reason. “ State capitalism 

is the authoritarian state of the present . [ …] The self -movement of the concept of the 

commodity leads to the concept of state capitalism” (Horkheimer 1940, 96, 108). 

Neumann disagreed with Friedrich Pollock’s assessment that Nazism was a new 

order of state capitalism that had replaced monopoly capitalism. In state capitalism, Christian Fuchs

according to Pollock there would be a primacy of politics over the economy. Hor k-

heimer largely followed Pollock’s app roach. Neumann did not share the assumption 

that state power strongly limited capital’s power in Germany. He rejected the term 

state capitalism and characterised Nazism as totalitarian monopoly capitalism. Ne u-

mann argued that Nazism combined monopoly capit alism and a command economy 

and did thereby not bring about a new order and did not replace monopoly capita l-

ism. “ The German economy of today has two broad and striking characteristics. It is 

a monopolistic economy – and a command economy. It is a private capitalistic eco n-

omy, regimented by the totalitarian state. We suggest as a name best to describe it, 

‘Totalitarian Mo nopoly Capitalism’” (Neumann 2009 /1944 , 261). There were both 

ca pitalist and state interests (the latter involving the Nazi party, bureauc racy and the 

military) in Nazism that converged in the war economy: The Nazi regime wanted to 

arm Germany for an imperialist World War in order to accumulate power. Germany’s 

large industry welcomed such efforts because armament meant its expansion and 

pos sibilities for capital accumulation. Whereas Pollock more stresses the discontinu i-

ties between capitalism and fascism , Neumann tends to foreground the continuities. 

Underlying Neumann’s critique of the term totalitarian state capitalism is the a s-

sumption that “a state is characterized by the rule of law” (Neumann 2009/1944, 467) 

and that Nazi Germany was therefore not a state. Certainly not everyone will agree to 

such a concept of the state. Neumann (1936b) argues that the state in Nazi Germany 

wa s a racist state (559) and a leadership state (562), in which the “law is the will of 

the Leader in the form of law” (562). The rule of law did not exist (571). Instead Hitler 

and his cabinet passed laws per decree. The independence of the judiciary did no t

exist, the judge was “the absolute servant of the law, i.e., of the will of the Leader. 

[…] The judge was to serve the Leader” (573 -574). There was no separation of legi s-

lative, executive and judiciary power. Hitler had “supreme legislative and executive 

power” and also took on “judicial functions” (577). Neumann therefore concludes that 

the Nazi state was “in no way a Rechtsstaat” (570). He here differentiates between 

the state and a state under the rule of law and makes clear that Nazi Germany was a 

sta te without rule of law. This does not imply that it is not a state. It was not an Un-

staat (non -state), but rather an Unrechtsstaat (state of injustice, unjust/tyrannical 

state). 

Herbert Marcuse and Franz Neumann were close friends. Mar cuse’s first wife di ed 

in 1951 and Franz Neumann in 1954. Herbert Marcuse married Neumann’s widow 

Inge in 1956. Neumann and Marcuse’s works also resonated in many respects. Ma r-

cuse shared Neumann’s view that Nazi fascism was totalitarian monopoly capitalism: 

“For in the total itarian theory of the state the foundation of this society, i.e. the ec o-

nomic order based on private property in the means of production, are not attacked. 

Instead, they are only modified to the degree demanded by the monopolistic stage of 

this very econom ic order” (Marcuse 1934, 21). In the manuscript State and Individual 

Under National Socialism , Marcuse (1942, 69) refers to the first edition of Behemoth 

and argues that Neumann has shown that Nazi fascism has not abolished monopoly 

capitalism. Marcuse wri tes based on Neumann that big capital, the Nazi party and 

the army divided power in Nazi Germany. 

Some authors stress that there were major differences between the approaches of 

Neumann, Kirchheimer, Gurland , and Marcuse on the one side and Pollock, Hor k-

heimer , and Adorno on the other side (Held 1990, 52 -53). So for example Martin Jay 

in his book The Dialectical Imagination: A History of the Frankfurt School and the I n-

stitute of Social Research argues: “Franz Neumann’s general indifference towards 

psychol ogy was one of the factors preventing his being fully accepted by the Institut’s tripleC 15(2): 637 -650 , 2017

inner circle” (Jay 1996, 87). “Behemoth did contain short section on the psychology 

of charisma, but it ignored the Institut’s earlier work on the authoritarian personality 

en tirely. There was scarcely anything in Behemoth’s more than six hundred pages 

(including an appendix added in 1944) to suggest that Neumann accepted Fromm’s 

notion of the sado -masochistic character type” (Jay 1996, 162). It is certainly true that 

Behemoth does not contain any discussion of Freud, which however does not imply 

that the book ignores psychology. Jay’s criti cism can not be up held. Neumann 

(2009 /1944 , 402) for example writes in Behemoth that in “ terms of modern analytical 

social psychology, one co uld say that National Socialism is out to create a uniformly 

sado -masochistic character, a type of man determined by his isolation and insignif i-

cance, who is driven by this very fact into a collective body where he shares in the 

power and glory of the medi um of which he has become a part”. 

It i s an idiosyncratic critique to say that Neumann represents an orthodox Marxism 

(Jay 1996, 165) and “minimized the independent importance of anti -Semitism and 

racism in general” (162). Quite to the contrary, Neumann (1943, 27 -28) stressed that 

anti -Semitism was “the most constant sing le ideology of the Nazi Party. [ …] We may, 

indeed, say that anti -Semitism is the sole ideology that can possibly cement the Nazi 

Party [ …] Anti -Semitism is thus the spearhead of terror”. 

Rolf Wiggershaus in contrast in his book The Frankfurt School: Its H istory, The o-

ries, and Political Significance argues that not only Neumann, but also Adorno voiced 

criticism of Pollock’s approach on Nazism (Wiggershaus 1995, 282), whereas Hor k-

heimer defended Pollock. Adorno thought that Pollock politically assessed state cap i-

talism too positively. Wiggershaus stresses the parallels between Neumann and Po l-

lock and that their differences were rather at the level of words than of a fundamental 

theoretical nature: “Neumann's analysis of the relations between the party, the st ate, 

the armed forces and the economy made it clear that his differences of opinion with 

Pollock were basically quibbles about words. The development which Neumann d e-

scribed clearly pointed in the same direction as that for which Pollock had chosen the 

unh appy term ‘state capitalism’” (Wiggershaus 1995, 288 -289). The basic difference 

between Neumann on the one side and Pollock and Horkheimer on the other was 

that “Neumann insisted on the basically capitalist character of the Nazi system, and 

therefore thoug ht the notion had been disproved that an unexpected new social fo r-

mation and a fundamental anthropological transformation had forced their way ahead 

of socialism, overtaking all the hopes which had been raised in the previous de c-

ades” (289 -290). Horkheimer thought that Behemoth left out the cultural -

anthropological dimension of analysis. 

A prejudice about the Frankfurt School is that it reduced Marxism to culture and 

ideology and ignored Marx’s political economy. The way Marx understood political 

economy is evident in Capital Volume 1 (see Fuchs 2016). Marx starts the analysis of 

capitalism with the analysis of the commodity form. This analysis involves aspects of 

value, labour, and fetishism. Value and labour form the level of the productive forces, 

whereas fetishism deals with the way that subjectivity and intersubjectivity in a co m-

modity -producing society appear as things and objects as well as with the subjective 

experience of humans in a society shaped by the commodity form. So a true critical 

political econ omy -analysis focuses on economy, politics and ideology/ culture. The 

Frankfurt School under Horkheimer’s leadership advanced interdisciplinary studies 

that brought together many different perspectives. The works of Neumann, Kirchhe i-

mer, Gurland and Poll ock show that the analysis of the capitalist economy was an 

important element of the Frankfurt School at the time of Horkheimer and Adorno. 

“The work of Pollock, Neumann and Gurland is often ignored by critics of the Fran k-Christian Fuchs

furt school. If it were properly a ddressed, the charge that the school neglected polit i-

cal economy would lose a great deal of its force” (Held 1990, 360). 

Behemoth is a good example: It brings together economic, political and ideolog i-

cal analysis. Neumann starts the analysis with an introduction that focuses on N a-

zism ’s pre -history and context in the Weimar Republic. The book’s first part (“The 

Political Pattern of National Socialism)” starts with remarks on Nazi ideology. Ne u-

mann (2009 /1944 , 38) argues that it is opposed to “all trad itional doctrines and va l-

ues”, including liberalism, democracy and socialism. The second part focuses on the 

“Totalitarian Monopoly Economy”. The third part is about “The New Society” and f o-

cuses on Nazism’s class structure. 

Neumann shows how politics, ec onomy and ideology interacted in the Nazi sy s-

tem. In his analysis of Nazism’s polit ical system, he analyses how the leadership id e-

ology, anti -Semitism and racist imperialism shaped politics under Hitler. “ The justif i-

cation of this [leadership] principle is char ismatic: i t rests on the assertion that the 

Leader is endowed with qualities lacking in ordinary mortals. Superhuman qualities 

emanate from him and pervade the state, party, and people” (Neumann 2009 /1944 ,

99). Nazism is ideologically an “Anti -Semitic movement” that advocates “the co m-

plete destruction of the Jews” (111). The compulsory acquisition of Jewish property 

and the Jews’ deprivation of rights strengthened big business (117) and satisfied “the 

anti -capitalistic longings of the German people” (1 21). So terroristic state power had 

both economic and ideological dimensions and was driven by the political -ideological 

motive to annihilate the Jews. Nazism ideologically justified the Second World War 

as a war against “plutocratic -capitalistic Jewish de mocracies” (187). Imperialist wa r-

fare was justified as a “proletarian” warfare of the “Aryan race” against an imagined 

unity of capitalism, democracy, liberalism, socialism, and Marxism. Neumann speaks 

of the ideology of racial proletarianism (188). Naz ism ’s military strategy both had an 

ideological aspect ( the de struction of perceived enemies ) and a n economic dime n-

sion (the creation of Lebensraum for the biological expansion of “Aryans” and the 

biological and economic expansion of Germany). 

In part two, Ne umann shows that Nazism’s economy featured compulsory cartell i-

sation, the organisation of the entire economy based on the leader, the growth of 

monopolies via “Aryanisation”, Germanisation, technological progress in the heavy 

industries , and the eliminatio n of small and medium businesses, state intervention 

into the economy via the control of prices, investments, trade and the labour market 

(the abolishment of workers’ rights, the ban of trade unions and collective bargaining, 

compulsory labour). Neumann shows how ideology (leadership ideology, anti -

Semitism), militarism, the command economy and totalitarian politics were fused into 

a total system of control, annihilation, accumulation, expansion, and imperialist wa r-

fare. 

For the economic part of the book , Neumann could draw on knowledge by Arkadij 

R. L. Gurland, who like Neumann had fled from Nazi -Germany to the USA and was a 

resear cher at the exiled Institute of Social Research. Gurland (1941) published for 

example an analysis of Nazi Germany’s technolog y and economy in the Institute’s 

journal. In respect to section 2.III (The Monopolistic Economy), Neumann mentions in 

an endnote that he “discussed all the problems of this section” with Gurland (Ne u-

mann 2009/1944, 503, footnote 38). Neumann writes in the preface that Gurland 

“placed his comprehensive knowledge of German industry at my disposal” (Neumann 

2009/1944, xx). 

In section three, Neumann shows how Nazism’s ideology and class system inte r-

acted. Ideologically, Nazi fascism “claims to have [ …] created a society differentiated tripleC 15(2): 637 -650 , 2017 

> CC -BY -NC -ND: Creative Commons License, 2017 .
> 643

not by classes but according to occupation and training” (367). But in reality it under 

the ideological guise of racism and nationalism would have “deepened and solidified” 

class ant agonisms (367). Nazism organised society in “a m onistic, total, authoritar i-

an” (400) manner that was ideologically presented as an “abstract ‘people’s comm u-

ni ty,’ which hides the complete depersonalization of human relations and the isolation 

of man from man” (402). “ The essenc e of National Socialist so cial p olicy consists in 

the acceptance and strengthening of the prevailing class character of German soci e-

ty, in the attempted consolidation of its ruling class, in the atomization of the subord i-

nate strata through the destruction of every autonomous group mediating between 

them and the state, in the creation of a system of autocratic bureaucracies interfering 

in a ll human relations” (367). Nazism’s totalitarian monopoly capitalism deepened 

capitalist class structure via a terroristic state that driven by a nti -Semitic and racist 

ideology abolished the rule of law and exercised upmost violence. 

3. Anxiety and Politics and its Relevance in 2017 

Anxiety and Politics was first published in German as Angst und Politik in 1954. The 

English translation was published in the volume The Democratic and the Authoritar i-

an State: Essays in Political and Legal Theory that Herbert Marcuse edited in 1957 

after Neumann’s death in a car accident in Switzerland. Anxiety and Politics has 

again become of key importanc e in the times we live in today, which forms the bac k-

ground for tripleC ’s republication of the essay. 

In the article Approaches to the Study of Political Power , Neumann argues: “The 

devices and forms for the translation of economic power into political power thus vary 

considerably and yet patterns are discernible which ought to be more sharply defined 

on a comparative basis” (Neumann 1957, 14). Neumann here stresses that political 

economy is contextual and that the interacti on of economic, political and ideological 

power depends on specific societal conditions. We today live in a conjuncture of ec o-

nomic and political crisis that opens us power to changes and is shaped by two main 

tendencies. 

On the one hand there is a tenden cy of the de -globalisation of the economy and 

the rise of more nationally contained economies, in which state intervention favours 

national capitalist interests and monopolies. To a certain degree one can here speak 

of some elements of state capitalism. Ex amples are the British decision to leave the 

European Union, which takes Britain out of a major regional free trade association, 

and the election of Donald Trump as US president. Trump has voiced criticisms of 

free trade agreements such as NAFTA (North Ame rican Free Trade Agreement) and 

TPP (Trans -Pacific Partnership) because he thinks that Mexico and China are 

threatening US jobs. Trump’s critique is not a critique of capitalism, but a nationalist 

critique that pits nations against each other and disregard s the underlying conflict 

between global capital and labour (Fuchs 2017). He seems to aim at a more nationa l-

ly contained US capitalism that features low capital taxation and a high exploitation of 

labour as well as state power that is partly directly contr olled by the billionaires and 

thereby intervenes in favour of US capital interests (Fuchs 2017). He also argues in 

favour of a “Keynesian neoliberalism” that makes public investments into infrastru c-

ture projects that are controlled, carried out and whose r esults are owned by private 

for -profit corporations. 

On the second hand we have in different parts of the world experienced an i n-

crease of nationalism and authoritarian power. Since the mid -1970s, neoliberal cap i-

talism has become the dominant capitalist mo del and form of governance. It ma s-Christian Fuchs

siv ely strengthened capitalist interests and weakened working class interests by 

commodification, privatisation, market liberalisation, deregulation, financialisation, 

international competition states, and a regime of low/ no capital taxation. As a result, 

inequalities have been rising throughout the world. The world economic crisis that 

started in 2008 was a turning point: States turned towards state -capitalist measures 

in order to bail out banks and auto companies. At the same time, hyper -neoliberal 

austerity measures were launched. Right -wing demagogues used political fetishism 

for blaming migrants, refugees, welfare recipients, and other nations for the crises. 

Although there were some forms of progressive rebellion (such as the Occupy 

movements and the rise of Syriza, Podemos, Bernie Sanders, and Jeremy Corbyn), 

nationalism and authoritarianism have tended to be far -stronger tendencies. They 

distract attention from class questions by presenting social questions in terms o f n a-

tionalism and xenophobia. 

For Neumann (1957 , 2017 ), democracy is the unity of personal/civil , political and 

social rights. Neumann experienced the rise of Nazism in Germany and how dem o-

cratic rights were thereby undermined. Writing in the USA in the e arly 1950s, the time 

of McCarthyism, he feared the rise of a dictatorship and therefore warned that dict a-

torships emerge when civil, political and social rights are undermined and suspen d-

ed. The “transformation from democracy into dictatorship seems to ari se when the 

political system discards its liberal element and attempts to impose a creed upon its 

members, ostracizing those who do not accept it” (Neumann 1957, 194). 

“The real difference between democracy and dictatorship consists first in the 

boundlessness of political power of dictatorship in contrast with the voluntary 

restrictions which democracy imposes upon itself – that ant nothing else is the 

meaning of the rul e of the rights of man; secondly, in the responsibility of the 

holders of political power to the people, for democracy is not direct popular rule, 

but responsible parliamentary or governmental rule in contrast with the theory 

and practice of the irresponsi bility of a political power that rests upon the lea d-

ership principle. Thirdly, in a democracy political power is to be rationally e m-

ployed, not only negatively to keep down private social power, but positively to 

shape a decent existence. This is often ignored” (Neumann 1957, 269 ). 

Neumann distinguishes between simple dictatorship, caesaristic dictatorship, and 

totalitarian dictatorship (Neumann 1957, 233 -256). Although it is untrue that Ne u-

mann ignored aspects of subjectivity in Behemoth , it can certa inly be said that the 

book is more a combination of institutional analysis and ideology critique. The inte r-

esting aspect of his late work, including the essay Anxiety and Politics , is that it co m-

bines the institutional analysis of political economy with id eology critique and the 

analysis of subjectivity and socio -psychology. Neumann asked himself how it could 

be that authoritari anism existed as ideological and political movement and how it 

could be that citizens followed it. One can say that in his late wor k, Neumann tried to 

combine Marx and Freud and took up Freudo -Marxian elements. This becomes ev i-

dent by the fact that Neumann in Anxiety and Politics discusses, quotes and engages 

with Freud, where as in Behemoth any such reference is missing. “Compared wit h the 

Behemoth , the emphasis on the economic determinants has receded, but only in o r-

der to place these determinants in a more concrete framework. [ …] One of the pro b-

lems with which he was most concerned was the support for dictatorship among the 

underpriv ileged masses” (Herbert Marcuse, in: Neumann 1957, ix). Anxiety and Pol i-

tics tries to unite the objective and the subjective analysis of politics and capitalism .tripleC 15(2): 637 -650 , 2017

One could say it combines the analysis of Behemoth with Adorno and Fromm. It 

takes into accoun t aspects of capitalist development, the state, ideology, and socio -

psychology (see also Erd 1985, 200 -206, 218 -220) .

Based on Freud, Neumann argues that fear can take on the role of warning, pr o-

tection or destruction. When in a society, where societal an xiety prevails , a larger 

amount of individu als identifies with a caesaristic leader and project s their anger and 

aggressions into an imagined enemy who has been constructed by ideology and a

conspiracy theory, then the danger of dictatorship or even fascist dictatorship accor d-

ing to Neumann become s real. 

Destructive collective anxiety can emerge when one or several of the following fa c-

tors are present (Neumann 1957, 288 -293 ; Neumann 2017, 624 -628 ): 

a) the alienation of labour, 

b) destructive competition, 

c) social alienation: a group fears or is threatened by the decline of “its prestige, i n-

come, or even its existence” and “does not understand the historical process or is 

prevented from u nderstanding it” ( Neumann 1957, 290 ; Neumann 2017, 624 ), 

d) political alienation in respect to the political system, 

e) the institutionalisation of anxiety (for example in the form of a totalitarian mov e-

ment, propaganda or terror), 

f) destructive psycho logical alienation and persecutory anxiety. 

Neumann gives the following summary of these six dimensions: 

“Neurotic, persecutory anxiety can lead to ego -surrender in the mass through 

affective identification with a leader. This caesaristic identificati on is always r e-

gressive, historically and psychologically. […] An important clue for the regre s-

sive character is the notion of false concreteness, the conspiracy theory of hi s-

tory. [ …] The intensification of anxiety into persecutory anxiety is successful 

when a group (class, religion, race) is threatened by loss of status, without u n-

derstanding the process which leads to its degradation. […] Generally, this 

leads to political alienation, i.e., the conscious rejection of the rules of the game 

of a political system. […] The regressive mass movement, once it has come to 

power must, in order to maintain the leader -identification, institutionalize anxi e-

ty. The three methods are: terror, propaganda, and, for the followers of the 

leader, the crime committed in com mon .” (Neumann 1957, 293 -294 ; Neumann 

2017, 628 )

Neumann’s analysis is so topical today because many of these factors are present in 

various parts of the world: Neo liberal capitalism has intensified the alienation of l a-

bour, destructive competition, large -scale fear of social decline, political apathy and a 

lack of trust in the political system, political parties, politicians and democracy, the 

institutionalisation of anxiety in the form of demagogic, nationalist, xenophobic far -

right movements, and the la rge -scale psychological desires for not just social 

change, but destructive social change. At the same time, we have seen a relative 

weakness and fractioning of the political Left and a shift of social democracy towards 

the right and neoliberalism that has been going on for decades . Contemporary soci e-

ties may as a combination of these conditions be at a tipping point, where quantity 

turns into a new quality. Neumann argues that persecutory anxiety can take on three 

methods: “terror, propaganda, and, for the followers of the leader, the crime commi t-

ted in common” (Neumann 1957, 294 ; Neumann 2017, 628 ). In many parts of the Christian Fuchs

world, anxiety has taken on at least one of these elements, namely right -wing prop a-

ganda. In some, it has also already taken on others too .

Consider the following two examples of political communication on Twitter: 

Figure 1: Tweet by Donald Trump (E xample 1 )

Figure 2: Tweet by Donald Trump (E xample 2 )

How can Anxiety and Politics help us to understand the political -economic, ideolog i-

cal and psychological dimension s of such social media postings? Trump appeals in 

his political communication to those, who feel or fear the negative impacts of capita l-

ism, neoliberalism, inequalities, unemployment, social decline, or de -industrialisation. 

He speaks to those who feel or have the fear that their labour is or coul d become 

highly alienated (a) and t hat capitalism’s new -imperialist globalisation has resulted in 

destructive competition that brings about precarity and unemployment (b), to those 

wh o feel or fear that their social status declines (c), and to those who are fed up with 

the existing political parties, politicians, and politicians whom they see as corrupt 

elites (d). Trump himself is as a political Leader an institutionalisation of such anxi e-

ties (e). He communicates simple nationalist solutions to complex problems by using 

right -wing ideology as destructive political response to anxiety (f). 

Trump ’s nationalist ideology claims he will bring about change that means a return 

to a better past. It says it “make America great again”. He says that the USA’s n a-

tional greatness is under attack by China, Mexico, illegal immigrants, Africans, the 

transfer of taxes to foreigners, and development aid. He identifies Americanness and 

the American interest with the American work ing class and un -Americanness with 

develop ing countries and immigrants. 

Trump combines two semiotic chains: The chain of negative associations (amne s-

ty, illegals, waste, Africa) is ideologically set into a relation to the chain of positive tripleC 15(2): 637 -650 , 2017

> 647

associations (protect, invest, concern, work ers, America, greatness). The total me s-

sage is that the USA is under attack and threatened by immigrants, the developing 

world, and everything foreign. Trump identifies US labour and US capital as having a 

joint national interest that is under external attack. He presents political -economic 

conflict as an antagonism between nations and thereby deflects attention from the 

class contradiction between capital and labour and power ine qualities that are at the 

heart of contemporary crises. Trump communicates a state of exception and co n-

stant crisis that would require his political leadership in order to “make America g reat 

again”. What is missing and what he tends not to mention is that US capital is tran s-

national not just exploits US workers, but also migrant workers and workers in deve l-

oping countries. 

Right -wing authoritarianism responds to political -economic crises with ideologies 

that speak to dise nfranchised individuals’ psychology . Those who feel politically an x-

ious have an ambiguous relationship to love and hate. They seek for an alternative 

and identity that promises them hope and they want to express their anger and a g-

gression. Figures like Trump on Twitter and in other forms of public communication 

institutionalise anxiety by offering opportunities to these individuals for loving the n a-

tion and the Leader and expressing hatred against scapegoats. Right -wing author i-

ta rianism works on the level of psychological anxieties, fires, d esires, emotions, a f-

fects, and instincts. It often does not use rational arguments, but post -truth political 

psychology and ideology. A key question for progressive movements is how to r e-

spond to such movements. Rational arguments and statistics that decon struct far -

right claims are often not enough. The question arises what political strategies are 

best suited for turning the love for the Leader and the nation into the love for human i-

ty, democracy and socialism and the hatred against immigrants and refugee s into the 

critique of capitalism. 

4. Axel Honneth on Anxiety and Politics 

Axel Honneth (2009, 146 -156) focuses in his essay Anxiety and Polit ics: The 

Strengths and Weakness of Franz Neumann’s Diagnosis of Social Pathology in some 

detail on the article by Neumann that tripleC republished. Honneth is interested in 

Neumann’s essay because it deals with social pathologies of society, a key theme in 

Honneth’s theory of recognition. Honneth (2009, 150) claims that Neumann “disti n-

guishes emotional or affective types of identification from those free of affective co m-

ponents. [ …] He is convinced that this second type of identification is exclusively r a-

tional and, hence, does not constitute an example of individual regression”. The i m-

plication wou ld be that there is “an affect -free identification” (Honneth 2009, 151). 

It is on the one hand true that Neumann distinguishes between affective and non -

affective identification and considers the second one less regressive (Neumann 

1957, 278 ; Neumann 2017, 618 ). But he sees non -affective identification as o perat-

ing for example between lovers and small groups and says that there is a co -

operative form of affec tive identification . These considerations seem somewhat pa r-

adoxical because lovers certainly always have an emotionally -driven relationship and 

Neumann characterises small group relations as both affective and non -affective. It 

seems therefore more likely that what he has in mind is a Freudian distinction b e-

tween an identification that is based on dominance of the death drive and aggre ssion 

on the one hand and one that is based on the life instincts on the other hand . The 

first has caesaristic and authoritarian potentials, the second co -operative pote ntials 

that can contradict authori tarianism. Both forms certainly involve emotions. Christian Fuchs

Honneth (2009, 151) continues by saying that Neumann assumes that all forms of 

ego -boundary dissolution are rea ctionary and irrational. He here seems to misread 

Neumann , who says that the identification o f the masses with leaders means “a nea r-

ly total ego -shrinkage” (Neumann 1957, 278; Neumann 2017, 618) . Neumann is in 

his essay only concerned with the love to a leader that comes along with persecutory 

hatred against a constructed enemy. He does not analyse co -operative love that is 

free of hate and the role of the ego in it. He rather leaves open this question. A fa s-

cist group always demands total subsumption of the ego to the nationalist collective 

and its leader. Collectivism and the collective ide ntification with the leader trump the 

individual. In a so cial relationship that is based on co -operation, love and eros wit h-

out pe rsecutory and annihilatory hatred against an ideologically co nstructed e nemy ,

and the belief in a world of eq ual humans without the friend/enemy -logic, a diale ctic 

of the individual and the group becomes possible (see Johanssen 2016). 

Honneth argues that Neumann bases his analysis on a “Freudian orthodoxy” 

(Honneth 2009, 152) as represented by Adorno and Horkhei mer at the Institute for 

Social Research (he forgets to add Marcuse). Honneth thinks that “psychoanalytic 

‘rev isionism’” (Honneth 2009, 155) as represented by Erich Fromm is more appropr i-

ate. As a consequence, Honneth (2009, 154) criticises that Neumann’s a pproach 

would be “ tailored so much to the exceptional case of German National Socialism” .

Honneth misjudges the strengths of Neumann’s approach: By pointing out the role of 

conspi racy theories, anti -Semitism, terror, genocide and annihilation, Neumann does 

not say that authoritarianism always and with necessity leads to Auschwitz, but that 

negative factories of mass annihilation are the negative potential of authoritarianism 

and can be its final consequence, which is why we better ought to be critical of it .

5. Franz Neumann Today 

If Franz L . Neumann were alive today, he would stress that nationalism, xenophobia, 

and right -wing authoritarianism pose threats to democracy and the rule of law and 

that the key political task is to defend the civil liberties , political rights and social 

rights that constitute democracy. The very problem is that neoliberal capitalism has 

so much undermined social rights that civil and political rights have become enda n-

gered by a negative dialectic that has advanced destructive political forces. The only 

feasible alternative is a democratic front that defends social, political cultural rights 

against the threat of right -wing authoritarianism. 

Neumann’s article Anxiety and Politics reminds us that in such situation, the role of 

academics should be that they more than ever act as critical public intellectuals: 

Hence there remains for us as citizens of the university and of the state the dual 

offensive on anxiety an d for liberty: tha t of education and that of politics. 

Politics, again, should be a dual thing for us: the penetration of the subject ma t-

ter of our academic discipline with the problems of politics —naturally, not day -

to -day politics —and the taking of positions on political questions. If we are ser i-

ous about the humanization of politics; if we wish to prevent a demagogue from 

using anxiety and apathy, then we —as teachers and students —must not be s i-

lent. We must suppress our arrogance, inertia, and our revulsion from the a l-

le ged dirt of day -to -day politics. We must speak and write. [ …] Only through our 

own responsible educational and political activity can the words of idealism b e-

come history” ( Neumann 1957, 294 -295 ; Neumann 2017, 629 ). tripleC 15(2): 637 -650 , 2017
