12/23/2021 Because the Court has consolidated these applications for oral argument, future filings and activity in 21A244 and 21A247 will now be reflected on the docket of No. 21A244. Subsequent filings in No. 21A244 and/or 21A247 must therefore be submitted through the electronic filing system in No. 21A244. Any document submitted in connection with either of these applications must include on its cover the application number and caption for each application in which the filing is intended to be submitted. Where a filing is submitted in only one application, the docket entry will reflect that; a document filed in both applications will be noted as “VIDED.”
