# Coronavirus in the Corridors of Power

Updated June 17, 2020, 10:29AM EDT

The coronavirus knows no borders, and no continent—except for Antarctica—has been spared. The virus has also made its way into the corridors of power, and scores of national and local politicians around the world have announced that they have contracted the bug. In Iran, at least a dozen current and former officials, politicians, and religious figures have died after contracting the virus.

One question is how many of them have been contracting it from each other. U.S. President Donald Trump raised eyebrows at a press conference on March 13, shaking hands and mingling with other members of the coronavirus task force despite having come into direct contact with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro’s press secretary, who tested positive for the virus. Experts advise against hand-shaking and recommend that people who have come into contact with people known to have the virus to self-quarantine for up to 14 days. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went into self-quarantine after his wife was found to have the coronavirus.

Here is a list of some of the world leaders, politicians, and senior officials who have contracted the virus. This list is updated every weekday, but, due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus, it is not exhaustive.

Very unpleasant phone calls to make.”Three other members of parliament he may have come into contact with have since quarantined themselves.
