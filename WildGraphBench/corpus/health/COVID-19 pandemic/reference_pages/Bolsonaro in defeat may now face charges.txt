Brazil’s president has faced investigations that have been staved off or blocked so far given his presidential immunity. But that may now change of his defeat in Sunday’s election.

Jair Bolsonaro won Brazil’s last presidential election pledging to clean up politics, and since taking office in 2019, he had said [at least 237 times](https://www.aosfatos.org/todas-as-declara%C3%A7%C3%B5es-de-bolsonaro/?q=honesto&o=#i) that his government had “zero corruption.”

Those assertions resonated with supporters of Mr. Bolsonaro as he faced [a tight runoff](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/03/world/americas/brazil-elections-runoff-bolsonaro-lula.html) on Sunday for the presidency against the [once-imprisoned](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/world/americas/lula-bolsonaro-brazil-election.html) former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva.

In recent weeks, however, Mr. Bolsonaro worried about the prospect of prison himself, according to two senior officials who heard those concerns from the president and spoke anonymously to describe private conversations.

Despite his assertions, Mr. Bolsonaro and his inner circle have faced investigations on accusations including the embezzlement of public funds, theft of staff wages and mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic. The inquiries had been staved off or blocked so far, given his political influence and presidential immunity.

But that may change now that Mr. Bolsonaro lost Sunday’s presidential election.

“After leaving office, there is no immunity, none, for crimes committed by a former president in Brazil,” said Eloísa Machado, a law professor at Fundação Getulio Vargas, a university and research organization in São Paulo, Brazil.

Brazilian law leaves less room for interpretation on the issue than in the United States, where former President Donald J. Trump’s assertions of presidential immunity have helped him maneuver around [investigations](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/22/us/politics/trump-finances-lawsuits.html) and lawsuits.
