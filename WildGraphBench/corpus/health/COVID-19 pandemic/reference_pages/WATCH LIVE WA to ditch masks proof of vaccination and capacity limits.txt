Western Australia will ditch its indoor mask mandate and proof-of-vaccination requirements from Friday and will remove all capacity limits at venues.

The state’s border control regime will also be dropped, with G2G applications to be scrapped along with the requirement for interstate arrivals to be triple-jabbed.

### Brisbane swelters as storm clean-up continues

Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson announced masks would no longer be mandatory in indoor settings and patrons would no longer have to show proof of vaccination at venues in a major overhaul of WA's COVID-19 restrictions.

WA will also move into line with the rest of the country and remove the need for close contacts to isolate for seven days. Asymptomatic close contacts will instead be required to wear masks in public, test daily and avoid vulnerable settings.

Announcing the loosening of restrictions back to “baseline levels” on Tuesday, WA Health Minister Amber-Jade Sanderson said the state “has secured the soft landing that we all wanted”.

“The advice from the chief health officer is that now is the appropriate time to lift those restrictions because the hospitals are managing,” Sanderson said.

“It’s time to start to go back to living with COVID, to working as normal, going to school as normal and playing sport as normal, but please be mindful of our vulnerable members of the community.”

The removal of the proof-of-vaccination requirement followed 99 per cent of the eligible population being double-dosed, and 79 per cent boosted.

Sanderson said the workplace vaccine mandate would remain in place, and masks would still be required in high-risk settings such as hospitals, aged care facilities and public transport.

“With such a high proportion of the community vaccinated, we want to take the burden of checking and enforcing the vaccination requirements off businesses,” she said.

International arrivals are still required to have been double-dosed under Commonwealth rules.

Premier Mark McGowan said the government’s health advice indicated now was the right time to implement the changes.

In a recording from his home, where he is isolating after contracting COVID, McGowan said the changes did not mean the state was fully out of the pandemic, and urged West Australians to “use common sense”.

“If you’re unwell, please stay home. If you test positive, of course stay home and monitor your health,” he said.

“If you feel like you need to wear a mask when you’re out, wear a mask.”

The Premier also called for West Australians to support businesses including bars, cafes and retail outlets impacted by the pandemic and the restrictions put in place to curb the virus’ impact.

“This is the time to do it. A lot of them have suffered over the course of the last few months, in fact the last couple of years,” he said.

“This pandemic was nothing anyone expected. It was something that everywhere across the world has had to endure and go through.

“But I’m confident to say that Western Australia and West Australians have performed the best of anywhere in the entire world ... we’ve achieved our soft landing out of COVID.”

McGowan is expected to leave isolation later this week.

Prior to Tuesday’s announcement, WA was the only jurisdiction in the country still enforcing an indoor mask mandate and one of only two still requiring density limits at hospitality venues.
