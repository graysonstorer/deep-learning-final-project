COVID Cases in Atlantic Bubble Remain Low as Cases Grow Across Canada
=====================================================================

Dec 23, 2020 | 6:47 AM

![Image 4: COVID Cases in Atlantic Bubble Remain Low as Cases Grow Across Canada](https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/900/files/2020/11/covid-pandemic.jpg)

While the number of cases of COVID-19 in Canada continues to grow, totals within the Atlantic Bubble remain relatively low.

Canada’s Chief Public Health Officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, says there are over 77,000 active counts of the coronavirus countrywide. On average, nearly 3,200 were in the hospital with the virus each day last week.

Just days before the province enacts a new lockdown, Ontario declared about 2,200 new cases. That number is similar to Quebec, which reported over 2,000 cases for the third day in a row.

The Atlantic provinces kept their numbers low with 10 newly-reported cases yesterday, bringing the total number of active infections across the four provinces to 122. Just one new case was identified in Newfoundland and Labrador yesterday.

While there are some concerns around a new variant of the coronavirus identified in the UK, Dr. Tam says there is no evidence of the strain arriving in Canada this far.
