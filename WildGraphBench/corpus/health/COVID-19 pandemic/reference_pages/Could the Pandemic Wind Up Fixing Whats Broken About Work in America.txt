Historically, major crises have tended to empower workers. The coronavirus is already changing things, for better and for worse.

Crises like pandemics, economic collapses and world wars have, at times throughout history, ended up reordering societies — shrinking the gap between the rich and the poor, or empowering the working class. The Black Death helped end feudalism. The Great Depression helped lead to the New Deal. Never has extreme economic inequality shrunk in a meaningful way, says the Stanford historian Walter Scheidel, without a major crisis.

The coronavirus pandemic, as of now, is not on the order of the plague, but it’s hitting the United States during a period of agitation about worsening inequality and [waning power for workers](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/03/opinion/sunday/labor-unions.html). Already, it has made stark how precarious life is for many American workers, causing some [to revolt](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/business/trader-joes-unionization-coronavirus.html). How employers and policymakers respond could improve work in the United States for the long term — or make the existing problems worse.

“Pandemics as a social shock do give workers more leverage to demand things,” said Patrick Wyman, a historian and host of the [Tides of History](https://wondery.com/shows/tides-of-history/) podcast. “Crises like these reveal what is already broken or in the process of breaking.”

“They are attacks on a particular socioeconomic way of organizing your society,” he said. “The question is whether your institutions can make collective things happen.”

The United States is distinctive among rich countries in its lack of worker protections like nationwide paid sick leave, paid family leave and universal health insurance, and in its [minimal labor union membership](https://www.oecd.org/els/emp/collective-bargaining.htm). For both high and low earners, many employers expect workers to be on call around the clock. Companies are typically beholden to [shareholders first](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/business/dealbook/business-roundtable-corporate-responsibility.html), above employees, customers and communities.

But the coronavirus pandemic has shown the flaw in that logic: Worker well-being is the foundation for everything else.
