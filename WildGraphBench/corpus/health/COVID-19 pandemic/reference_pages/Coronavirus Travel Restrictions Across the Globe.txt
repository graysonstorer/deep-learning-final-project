Most of the world’s countries are open to [travelers](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/world/europe/travel-ban-usa-europe.html) from the United States, and many nations are easing their requirements for visitors to test or quarantine. Some countries that had fully closed to foreign tourists — including Israel, Morocco, Bhutan, [Australia](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/02/07/world/covid-test-vaccine-cases/australia-reopen-borders-vaccinated-travel) and [New Zealand](https://covid19.govt.nz/international-travel/travel-to-new-zealand/when-new-zealand-borders-open/) — have now reopened to U.S. visitors, although they may continue to impose testing, vaccination or quarantine requirements.

In Europe, a growing number of nations — including Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, Switzerland and the United Kingdom, among many others — have eliminated their Covid-related travel restrictions for the summer travel season. Meanwhile, several Southeast Asian nations that had closed their borders to tourists have now reopened. Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar and Cambodia are once again welcoming American visitors, although vaccine or testing requirements are in force in most cases.

For its part, the United States has lifted the requirement that inbound passengers, including returning Americans, provide a negative test result taken within one day of departure. The decision to lift the test requirement will be re-evaluated in September; the rule could be reinstated if authorities deem it necessary.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meanwhile, continues advising Americans [not to travel internationally](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/international-travel-during-covid19.html) until they are fully inoculated against Covid-19.

Those wanting to learn about the coronavirus risk in a specific country can visit the [C.D.C. website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html) where a four-tier ranking system provides guidance. The agency reserves the highest “Level 4” ranking for countries with “special circumstances” that include spiking case numbers, the emergence of worrying variants, or threats to the viability of health care infrastructure. (Levels 1 to 3 are still based primarily on Covid-19 case counts.) At the moment, no countries are classified at Level 4; those at Level 3, which have a “high” incidence of Covid-19, are indicated in the list below. For information on entry requirements like testing and quarantine, as well as curfews and movement restrictions, [the State Department’s website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/COVID-19-Country-Specific-Information.html) offers detailed information by country.

What follows is a list of countries that are open to tourists from the United States. Many require visitors to complete a health form, provide proof of vaccination, and present a recent negative Covid-19 test result. To qualify as fully vaccinated in places such as France, Spain and the Netherlands, a visitor must have received either a booster shot or a second dose within a specified period.
