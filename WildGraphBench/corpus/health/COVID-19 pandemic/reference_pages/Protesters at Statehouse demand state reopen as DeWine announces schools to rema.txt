Ohio now has nearly 13,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 509 confirmed and probable deaths from the virus. The pandemic led DeWine and Ohio Health Director Dr. Amy Acton to shutter all but essential pieces of the state to stop its spread.

DeWine and Acton have enjoyed near-universal praise for their handling of the outbreak in Ohio. The Republican governor has skyrocketing approval ratings and has been featured by national media outlets.

But a growing chorus of detractors are worried that shutting down most of the state for months is damaging its economy. Protesters have repeatedly gathered outside the Statehouse in the past week to implore DeWine to rescind his administration’s orders while flouting social-distancing and face-mask recommendations from public-health officials around the globe who are battling the pandemic.

#### [Video: Coronavirus protesters rally Monday at Statehouse](https://www.dispatch.com/news/20200421/video-coronavirus-protesters-rally-monday-at-statehouse "Video: Coronavirus protesters rally Monday at Statehouse")

April 21, 2020

“The Constitution is our king, not Mike DeWine,” Michael Neutzling said through a bullhorn to the crowd gathered on the west lawn of the Statehouse on Monday afternoon.

Neutzling, a former nurse from Columbus, decried what he said is a “cult” following for Acton in central Ohio’s “liberal neighborhoods.” He declined to answer direct questions from The Dispatch after speaking to the crowd.

Brian Scheiderer, a protester and park maintenance worker from Plain City, said the state has been acting on bad information. Early models showed that Ohio would experience a peak of 10,000 new cases a day in late April, but the state has revised that to about 1,600 per day.

Instead of reacting to the new data, DeWine and Acton continue to adhere to orders that were based on a much higher peak, Scheiderer said.

“They need to take the facts, re-evaluate, and deal with the real numbers,” Scheiderer said.

DeWine and Acton have repeatedly said that the peak dropped because of the actions taken to “flatten the curve” and that those orders needed to remain in place to prevent the spread of the virus from accelerating again.

Protester Wally Dolinski, a union pipefitter from Dayton, chafed at the notion that those actions have contributed to fewer cases, calling DeWine and Acton’s orders an “overreaction.” Dolinski organized a Facebook event to try to gather protesters at the Statehouse on Monday.

Of the curve that DeWine, Acton and public-health officials around the country have said must be flattened, Dolinski said: “It’s been nothing but maybe a ripple.”

The protest on Monday drew people from around the state and from a cross section of groups that included Second Amendment activists, opponents of vaccines, and anti-abortion advocates. There were dozens of Trump hats, “Make America Great Again” signs and at least one pickup truck with a tailgate that said “Trump 2020 Keep America Great!!”

One demonstrator held a “Free Joe Exotic” sign as cars streamed down 3rd Street, honking at the group.

Anti-Semitic signs that appeared in the protests over the weekend didn’t resurface on Monday, and organizers on Monday distanced themselves from those who had carried them.

Many of the signs and chants carried messages about returning Ohioans to work and questioned whether DeWine and Acton should have the power to shutter businesses. In the past month, 855,197 workers in Ohio — about 15% of the workforce — filed unemployment claims.

DeWine has said his administration plans to start reopening parts of the state on May 1 as part of a slow return to normal operations, but he has cautioned that the virus will remain a threat until a vaccine is developed.

Audrey Stoffel of Lancaster said she was laid off from her job as a scheduler in a doctor’s office.

“Right now, the numbers don’t justify the actions,” she said.

- [x] Sale of Personal Data 

Under the California Consumer Privacy Act, you have the right to opt-out of the sale of your personal information to third parties. These cookies collect information for analytics and to personalize your experience with targeted ads. You may exercise your right to opt out of the sale of personal information by using this toggle switch. If you opt out we will not be able to offer you personalised ads and will not hand over your personal information to any third parties. Additionally, you may contact our legal department for further clarification about your rights as a California consumer by using this Exercise My Rights link.

If you have enabled privacy controls on your browser (such as a plugin), we have to take that as a valid request to opt-out. Therefore we would not be able to track your activity through the web. This may affect our ability to personalize ads according to your preferences.

These may be set through our site by our advertising partners. They may be used by those companies to build a profile of your interests and show you relevant adverts on other sites. They do not store directly personably identifiable information but are based on uniquely identifying your browser and internet device. If you do not allow, you will still see advertisements but they will be less targeted to your likes.

This allows us to count visits and traffic sources so we can measure and improve the performance of our site. They help us to know which pages are the most and least popular and see how visitors move around the site. All information collected is aggregated and therefore anonymous. If you do not allow this service we will not know when you have visited our site, and will not be able to monitor its performance.
