Beijing says its heavy-handed measures are working. Can other countries battling the outbreak learn from its efforts — or is the cure worse than the disease?

BEIJING — As the new coronavirus races around the world, [tanking markets](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/business/coronavirus-stock-market.html), cutting off [global travel](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/business/coronavirus-airline-industry.html) and suspending school for [hundreds of millions of children](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/04/world/coronavirus-schools-closed.html), governments are desperate for ways to contain it.

China, the place where it first appeared, says it has the answers.

To the surprise of some, the country that [concealed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/world/asia/Li-Wenliang-china-coronavirus.html) and [mismanaged](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/world/asia/china-coronavirus-doctors.html) the initial outbreak appears to be bringing it under control, at least by its own official figures. The number of new cases reported has fallen dramatically in recent days even as infections are surging in other countries. The World Health Organization has praised Beijing’s response.

Officials reported only 99 new cases on Saturday, down from around 2,000 a day just weeks ago, and for the second day in a row, none were detected in [Hubei](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/world/asia/china-floods-rain.html) Province outside of its capital, Wuhan, the center of the outbreak.

China says the trend proves that its containment measures — which include a lockdown on nearly 60 million people in Hubei and strict quarantine and travel restrictions for hundreds of millions of citizens and foreigners — are working. And it has begun trying to promote its efforts as successful in propaganda at home and abroad.

The rest of the world, much of it fearfully confronting its first cases, has taken note. But there is also concern that China’s numbers may be flawed and incomplete. The real test will be whether the virus flares again when children return to classrooms and workers to factories, and commuters start taking buses and subways.

China’s blunt force strategy poses deeper questions for other countries. Its campaign has come at great cost to people’s livelihoods and personal liberties. Even countries that could copy China still have to ask whether the cure is worse than the disease.
