# 'Most significant crisis in the history of travel': where to now for tourism?

"We didn’t see any noticeable change after December’s volcanic eruption on [New Zealand’s] White Island. The bushfires obviously dampened consumer sentiment and confidence a lot, but it still wasn’t significant enough for me to report back to head office. But _this_… "

Sarina Bratton, Asia-Pacific chairman of the French cruise line Ponant, is triaging the flock of black swan events to hit her industry in recent months. Dubbed the queen of Australian cruising, her experience is unparalleled.

In 1997, the Australian-born Bratton became the first woman in the world to launch a cruise line, the Norwegian Capricorn Line. Seven years later she did it again, launching Orion Expeditions Cruises in Australia. After selling her Orion stake to the American cruise line Lindblad Expeditions in 2013, she joined Ponant to establish its Australian presence and help internationalise its market beyond its European base, which has since taken its fleet from three to what was to soon be 15 ships.

Along the way, Bratton has experienced every crisis that’s earned an acronym, from SARS to the GFC and MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome). "We’ve been through them all and bounced back without really significant impacts on operations," she says. "But this is something that we haven’t seen before, at a level we haven’t seen before."

It’s Thursday, March 19: 11 weeks since the coronavirus was first identified, six since it was confirmed to have spread aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship off Japan and a week after the Australian government announced a [$1 billion tourism stimulus package](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/tourism-industry-gets-1-billion-boost-amid-unprecedented-crisis-20200312-p549cp.html) that includes waiving maritime and national park fees and promoting domestic travel.

Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce has just [stood down](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/qantas-grounds-international-flights-stands-down-two-thirds-of-staff-20200319-p54bmh.html) most of the airline’s workforce, announcing all international flights will be suspended from late March as part of what he dubs a new era of survival of the fittest.

Within hours, the Australian government announces it is[banning non-resident arrivals](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/australia-bans-all-non-residents-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-20200319-p54brz.html), an historic moment in a mainly immigrant nation. The day before it counselled [against all overseas travel](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/travel-warning-raised-indoor-mass-gatherings-over-100-people-prohibited-20200318-p54b85.html), equally historic in a country with travel in its DNA, having a few days earlier suspended cruising in the most cruise-crazy country in the world.

Underlining our persistence as travellers, 16,000 Australians are later revealed to have left Australia after the March 18 travel warning. By late March, hundreds of thousands of Australians were stranded on ships or in hotels and hostels around the world – including 3000 on 30 cruise ships alone, at the time of writing – from the coasts of Chile to France, Peru to the Philippines, as ports and countries closed.

And highlighting the speed at which things have shifted, Bratton had been hoping barely a fortnight earlier that Ponant might be able to dodge the worst of the crisis, given it specialises in small – 180- to 240-person – cruises to places inaccessible to larger ships that carry thousands. Subsequent border and port closures had, though, made it clear that nothing and no one would be spared.

"It’s the most significant crisis in my 40 years but it’s more than that: it’s the most significant in the history of travel," Bratton says, finishing the triage that started with White Island in what is suddenly not just another year but another era.

By then, Ponant had announced it would lay up its entire fleet, after a meeting in Paris with its owner, Groupe Artémis, the private family company founded by French billionaire François Pinault, which controls a swath of luxury companies including Christie’s, Château Latour, Gucci, Saint Laurent, Bottega Veneta and Balenciaga.

But even stopping is proving difficult. Bratton and the line’s Marseille-based executive are still trying to disembark four cruises when we speak. "We’ve been denied access to Uruguay and Buenos Aires and Valparaíso and Ushuaia," she says. "We’re working with [the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade] and French and Australian embassies around the world."

Meanwhile, as everywhere, scenario planning continues. "We’re looking at whether this is a two-month event, a six-month event or 12, and what each of those scenarios look like," Bratton says. "Fortunately, we have tremendous support from the shareholders and that puts us in a very different position to many. This is going to force consolidation in the cruise industry but – and this is what concerns me most deeply – put a lot of stress on a lot of operators’ cash flows; cruise lines, airlines, travel companies. Who knows whether they’ll survive?"

That process is already well underway, according to a senior Australian travel executive who works with a range of high-end operators, from hotels, airlines and travel agencies to cruise and tour operators. "The travel business is short-term and turnarounds are tight," says the executive, who does not want to be named. "There isn’t a lot of fat, so it doesn’t take long for small businesses to start collapsing once the wheels stop turning."

Those wheels had already fallen off even before Scott Morrison urges Australians to immediately [reconsider even non-essential domestic travel](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/scott-morrison-calls-for-all-non-essential-travel-to-be-avoided-20200322-p54co4.html) on Sunday, March 22. "We’ve had 300 calls waiting, all cancelling or checking conditions and insurance refunds, all of which changes hourly," the executive says the day before.

"There was a surge in private jets, mainly back to China, where the pilots would drop people off in China and immediately turn around and come back. But that was a couple of weeks ago. The only bookings we are getting now is [Australian] clients trying to get their kids – who’ve skipped off on gap years – back as borders close."

That Monday, one of the largest agencies, the Sydney-based Helloworld Travel, announces it will [retrench 275 staff](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/worst-since-1932-two-million-aussies-face-unemployment-queue-20200323-p54d14.html) and stand down 1300 worldwide, or 65 per cent of its workforce, until the end of May, with the rest offered reduced working hours.

The next day, Australia’s second-largest airline, [Virgin Australia](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/virgin-australia-cuts-90-per-cent-of-flights-stands-down-8000-workers-20200325-p54dme.html), stands down 8000 of its 10,000 workers for the same period, two days after rating agency Moody’s further downgrades its credit rating amid concerns about its ability to survive the pandemic. Two days later, Flight Centre announces an initial 6000 of its global staff – including [3800 Australians](https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/flight-centre-to-stand-down-3800-staff-around-australia-20200326-p54e2s.html) – will either be stood down or made redundant.

As the PM urges against non-essential travel on March 22, the Australian industry’s national peak body, the Tourism & Transport Forum (TTF), quietly updates the already staggering losses it modelled just weeks earlier at the start of March.

Back then, TTF estimated lost tourism receipts in Australia of [$2 billion a month](https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/tourism-losses-to-hit-3-billion-per-month-as-data-shows-visitor-slump-20200316-p54alm.html) for every month the pandemic continued on the back of what was then widely expected to be a 40 per cent fall in international visitation.

By March 22, that had ballooned to $9 billion a month – almost $4 billion from lost international visitation and another $5 billion from the domestic travel market – with expected job losses across the sector ballooning from 130,000 to 330,000 or 50 per cent of the tourism workforce.

"Our industry has never encountered a catastrophe of this magnitude, with the aviation sector pretty much grounded, the cruise industry at a standstill and hotels in crisis with occupancy rates at less than 10 per cent," TTF chief executive Margy Osmond said at the time.

A day later, Osmond tells _Good Weekend:_ "The industry has gone from crippled to gutted. It’s in free fall and it’s in free fall across the board. The issue is that, for all the right reasons, the government has been focused on small to medium businesses, but this is no longer a small- to medium-sized business problem. Big business is now staring survival in the eye, too."

**By then**,**of course, the story of economic crisis** had long since ceased to be about cruising or travel. From financial markets to hospitality, sport to the arts, the whole world seemed to have fallen off a cliff, as words like "unprecedented" lost all meaning and history was minted in real time.

Throughout, however, travel and cruising have remained squarely in its crosshairs – and telescopic lens: from the Diamond Princess stranded off the coast of Japan on February 5, through near-empty airports haunted by figures in masks, to the[Ruby Princess](https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/aboard-the-ruby-princess-how-one-cruise-spawned-a-covid-19-outbreak-20200323-p54d2f.html), which is unaccountably permitted to unleash 2700 passengers at Sydney’s Circular Quay on March 19, more than 440 of whom were later found to have the virus. By April 3, the ship is estimated to be responsible for 10 per cent of Australia's COVID-19 cases, including seven of the country's 25 deaths.

A further passenger dies after contracting the disease aboard a Royal Caribbean cruise allowed to dock in Sydney. Meanwhile, WA Premier Mark McGowan begins turning back ships arriving in Perth. Diverting the Vasco da Gama – which had 800 Australians on board, including 250 West Australians – to quarantine on Rottnest Island, he attributes one in four confirmed WA cases to cruise ships over east.

"We’ve seen what happened in Sydney Harbour; it was a complete and utter disaster," says the usually low-key McGowan, who a week later describes the ongoing cruise-ship "situation" as one of the "most frustrating of my life".

At last count, most Australian coronavirus cases had come from overseas and at least a third from cruise ships. It’s hardly surprising the latter have been the enduring poster child throughout this crisis, travel its Petri dish.

Putting to one side the issues of blame and responsibility that will be debated and determined over coming weeks and months, COVID-19 is a story of contagion and connection, of how and where and why people gather; which is to say – as we entered the third decade of the 21st century – travel and tourism.

"What is different about this crisis isn’t that the nature of diseases themselves has fundamentally changed," says Judith Mair, associate professor of tourism at the University of Queensland’s Business School. "The issue is more that our global mobility and whole-world connectedness means everything moves faster – not just in terms of people but also information, news cycles and social media.

"The Black Death in the 14th century moved through Europe on merchant vessels, which took a long time. It didn’t mean the disease – or news of the disease – wasn’t going to get there. It just took a long time. For us now, it would be a plane; [a disease] would take hours to move from country to country, and the news of it would be instantaneous."

Business travel has been central to globalisation, plane trips the equivalent of train or bus trips in previous eras: a necessity long taken for granted to maintain relationships, do deals, check in on clients and suppliers.

Frequent flyer points have in the process turned into a whole new currency. The programs that govern them have become spin-off businesses of their own; gaming the system to land your smarty pants in a business- or first-class seat the contemporary equivalent of chess or bridge, a favoured sport of sophisticated players.

Leisure travel, meanwhile, has been the discretionary spend that middle classes have embraced as they’ve emerged – in part to signal that emergence – around the globe for half a century, not least in that most middle-class of countries, Australia.

In recent years, the burgeoning Chinese, south-east Asian and Indian middle classes have turbo-charged the sector’s global growth, including Australia, for which China is the biggest inbound market, with 1.4 million visitors a year spending almost $12 billion, more than any other nationality.

UN World Tourism Organisation figures recorded [1.5 billion arrivals](https://unwto.org/international-tourism-growth-continues-to-outpace-the-economy) around the world in 2019, more than double the 682 million in 2000 and 60 times the 25 million recorded in 1950. Interestingly, UNWTO noted when it released those figures in mid-January that "uncertainty surrounding Brexit, geopolitical and trade tensions and the global economic slowdown" had cut that annual growth rate to 4 per cent from 6 per cent or 7 per cent in previous years.

COVID-19 is, in a sense, the latest and largest twist in a longer-running tale of globalisation and its discontents, from Brexit and nationalist secession movements to right-wing populism and the rise of insularist leaders, from the UK to the US.

Cruising has been at the apex of that travel boom, again particularly in Australia, the greatest cruise market in the world on a per capita basis, where it was the fastest-growing part of the tourism sector. The number of Australians cruising increased more than tenfold between 2002 and 2018 – the last year for which industry peak body, the Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), released firm figures – from 116,000 people to [1.35 million](https://cruising.org/-/media/research-updates/research/clia_2019-source-market-reports_australia.pdf), or more than 5 per cent of the population.

Globally, the number of people cruising has almost doubled, from 17.8 million in 2009 to an estimated 30 million in 2019, according to CLIA, which announced in December that it expected 32 million people "to set sail in 2020". That prompted the January 20 _Forbes_ headline: "[State of the Cruise Industry: Smooth Sailing into the 2020s](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemicallef/2020/01/20/state-of-the-cruise-industry-smooth-sailing-into-the-2020s/)."

> You wonder, in fact, if it even makes sense to talk about black swan events anymore, when they’ve begun to come in flocks.

A full-blown pandemic doesn’t just make the blue-sky prognoses that predate it look ridiculous. As the music ends and everyone rushes for a chair – or home – tourism itself suddenly looks less the virtuous engine of economic growth it has been for decades and more like an exposed flank.

The suddenness of that shift is as remarkable as its scale. For years, the travel industry has launched ever more remote, elaborate and exclusive tiers of experience as the market has grown and matured, and travellers have become richer and more discerning. A [December CLIA report](https://cruising.org/news-and-research/press-room/2019/december/clia-releases-2020-state-of-the-cruise-industry-outlook-report), for example, noted its 50-plus member lines were scheduled to unleash 19 new cruise ships this year, bringing the expected total to 278. And as more lines and ships have come into operation, and once-remote destinations such as Antarctica and the Galapagos Islands become almost effortlessly achievable, the battle has been on for even more exclusive locations, from the Kimberley to the Aleutian Islands near Alaska.

"Bucket lists" and "boasting rights" have become the argot of the boom. Passengers booked their next cruise before they left their last, much as it became the norm to start planning your next trip as soon as you returned from your last. And nowhere more than in Australia.

The expatriate writer Kate Jennings described[Australians](https://www.afr.com/politics/the-away-game-20060630-j6zdz) as the "anthropologists of the wider world" in an article on the number of Australian writers, from Robert Hughes to Anna Funder and Peter Robb, who had written the definitive accounts of European cities and countries. Australians were, Jennings said, notable for our intense curiosity about a globe we had spent the generations before mass tourism watching – and imagining – from a distance.

And ever since the advent of mass tourism, "Australia has been unique in the proportion of our young people who view travel as a rite of passage," Tourism & Transport Forum’s Margy Osmond adds. "It’s ingrained in our psyches and DNA that we travel – really at either end of our lives, young and old."

**Now the only action in Australian travel is bringing them home**. And rather than lamenting the fall in Chinese tourists, as we did during summer’s seemingly endless bushfires, some speculate that those fires may have shielded Australia in an age of COVID-19, at least initially.

Even before borders closed, [Tourism Australia](https://www.smh.com.au/national/holy-cow-we-ve-got-no-bookings-international-tourism-plunges-30-per-cent-20200303-p546g1.html) (TA) had put the hit to inbound flight bookings since December at 36 per cent by mid-March, after boom years in which international visitors had almost doubled from five million in 2009 to 9.47 million by December 31, when the first news of a strange virus in the Chinese city of Wuhan emerged.

By then, images of our bushfires were being transmitted around the world 24/7 in a traditionally slow news season. TA has valued that negative publicity alone at $6.5 billion globally, with follow-up quantitative research across 15 markets around the world showing it had seriously deterred international travellers even then.

Underlining the perils of connectivity, more than 60 per cent of the 30,000 people surveyed believed that more than a quarter of Australia had been burnt, rather than less than a tenth of that figure, largely thanks to the colourful, highly inaccurate maps of a burning continent shared across social media.

"Our job at the height of the bushfire crisis was really myth-busting and making sure people knew the facts about what was happening, because their perception was that it was far, far worse than it actually was," says TA managing director Phillipa Harrison. During the fires, 70 per cent of the unusually heavy traffic to TA’s website, [Australia.com](http://australia.com/), went to the map and fact sheet posted to counter those inaccurate fire maps.

There was one silver lining to the clouds of smoke, however: "The bushfires meant there were relationships and mechanisms already in place for us to drive the conversations with government and others to see how we would survive," says Margy Osmond. "That has rolled on into the coronavirus. The government has been more responsive and that has been a huge advantage compared to other countries."

But only because the constellation of disasters – from drought and floods to fires and plague – has been so utterly biblical. You wonder, in fact, if it even makes sense to talk about black swan events anymore, when they’ve begun to come in flocks.

"It’s reasonable to assume that the natural disasters potentially associated with climate change, like bushfires, flooding, cyclones, are not going to be as unusual as they were in the past," says Judith Mair, who started developing a tourism recovery speciality with her University of Queensland Business School colleague, associate professor Gabby Walters, in the wake of Victoria’s 2009 Black Saturday fires.

![Image 7: Smoke haze over Sydney caused by the bushfires earlier this year. One silver lining of the fires is that governments were set up to deal with disasters when COVID-19 hit.](https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.136%2C$multiply_0.7725%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/e5b8f3845d440ac1d1b3ce2c61ed3085bd4f85ae)

Walters, who was on the board of Destination Gippsland at the time, discovered "there just wasn’t anything to refer to in terms of how you needed to respond to the tourism market and how to get visitors back to the region."

Their subsequent work has informed domestic-travel campaigns in the wake of the most recent bushfires. "These sorts of events are certainly something that we, as a country and an industry, are going to face … more and more often," Mair says.

And when they do, our exponentially increased connectedness means we all watch it unfold in real time, as citizen-journalists report across channels from the hotel rooms in which they’re stranded.

"Typically, disaster strikes, we see a lot of media attention, a lot of interest and then it kind of wanes," says Walters. "But this crisis just endures. In the past – when we’ve look at bushfires, when we’ve looked at earthquakes and floods – there seemed to be more positive news stories towards the tail-end of the crisis. But this time, there’s no news of things getting better yet. People are literally throwing their hands in the air now, going, ‘I don’t know what to do.’ "

> 
> Gavin Smith, managing director, Royal Caribbean Cruises, ANZ

Different parts of the sector – from tourist attractions to agencies to cruise lines – parse the disasters and tipping points differently. But the hit – as states go into lockdown, borders close and non-essential domestic travel ends – is now as uniform as it is absolute. "A lot of people are saying COVID-19 is a problem for every business," Margy Osmond says. "But not every business had to face the bushfires before that."

Gavin Smith, managing director of Royal Caribbean Cruises, Australia and New Zealand, agrees that the "rolling series of marketplace disruptions" that began with White Island and carried through the bushfires and COVID-19 has made this situation unique.

"It sucks because of the momentum we had as a business, building a couple of ships a year for the last three years; we were like a football team winning back-to-back premierships and just ticking off the third premiership, and we get hit by a competition-wide event."

In fact, the lack of precedent for bushfire recovery a decade back turns out to be symptomatic of a larger point. The tourism sector may have survived challenges ranging from 9/11 to SARS in recent decades, but in its comparatively short life, it’s never faced a truly existential threat.

"You can date tourism as an industry back to Thomas Cook inventing the package tour in the 1860s," says Judith Mair. "But it really only became a mass movement of people post-war, in the 1960s and 1970s. So unlike industries that have been around for centuries and survived world wars, it’s never had to deal with anything of the scale of COVID-19 that provides a model for how to deal with and recover from this."

**What everyone is sitting right now is essentially a balance sheet test**," David Hammon says at the start of March. Hammon’s grandfather, Harry, founded the company David and his sister Anthea now run, Hammons Holdings, in 1945, when he took over the lease on a former mine operating train rides in Sydney’s Blue Mountains on weekends to cater to GIs who had started turning up during the week.

Today the private family company operates what morphed into Scenic World – in which Hammon estimates it has invested $90 million over 18 years – together with BridgeClimb on Sydney Harbour.

Scenic World alone had "averaged between 800,000 to a million visitors a year since 2000", Hammon says. "In 2019, we hit 1.1 million, which made us the most-visited privately owned tourist attraction in Australia. A lot of that growth has come from China – we had about 33,000 Chinese visitors a year 13 years ago, now we have 200,000 – but a lot of it has been domestic as well."

Like most of the businesses to which _Good Weekend_ speaks, Hammons Holdings had just begun to notice the flicker of an uptick when COVID-19 bit. "We had just cleared the bushfires and started to see that recovering, which we thought would take a year," says David Hammon.

He puts the initial bushfire hit to Scenic World at 50 per cent and BridgeClimb – which relied less on Chinese tourism – at 20 per cent. COVID-19 evened the hit to 50 per cent apiece and the government-mandated closure of non-essential businesses on March 23 made it complete. "We just have to see when it ends. It’ll then take 18 months to recover. But we are the third generation of a family business; we have 75 years of continuity and we get that these things happen, so we are generally fairly conservative in our balance sheet."

> Some estimates put the number of Australians that may be out of work as a result of the pandemic at more than 2 million.

Not that that is even the main issue as the close-down hits. "Yesterday was the worst day of my life," Hammon says. "I had to watch my sister stand down 200 people at Scenic World, then come home and ring my parents – who we’d put into isolation last week – and our other three sisters to tell them. Every one of them cried." The same scenario played out at BridgeClimb for another 200 workers.

The ramifications of that single day for those 400 people are only now being felt, as part of a shift almost incomprehensible in its suddenness and scale. Some estimates put the number of Australians that may be out of work as a result of the pandemic at [more than 2 million](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/worst-since-1932-two-million-aussies-face-unemployment-queue-20200323-p54d14.html). What started as a story about the virus’ impact on an industry peculiarly exposed to its ravages quickly morphed into a very human tragedy, as Depression-era lines snaked around blocks outside Centrelink offices around the country.

For a lot of businesses, too, the whammy hasn’t just been double or triple – or months. "The interesting thing for us is that we have been feeling the effects of all this for a while," says Cameron Kerr, CEO of Taronga Conservation Society, which operates the eponymous zoo on Sydney’s north shore and Western Plains Zoo in Dubbo, NSW.

"There’s been a grinding drought [in western NSW] for two years, which is now thankfully gone but had a big effect, and then to overlay that with the unusual fire season … I’ve been [at Taronga] for 20 years – through SARS, the Bali bombing, MERS and the GFC – but we’ve not seen anything like this."

Compounding things, Kerr says the fires had meant Taronga was already facing "unprecedented demand for our really quite unique conservation skills and expertise", the area it funds as a not-for-profit conservation society. That all happened as the businesses Taronga built to further bolster and diversify its conservancy income streams, such as the luxury Wildlife Retreats it launched in October last year, foundered.

"It went strongly for five weeks, then we saw a significant slowdown," Kerr says. "It’s been heartbreaking." Again, heartbreak followed boom years, with visitor numbers up 20 per cent – and international visitors up 28 per cent – over five years across the two zoos to 2.04 million by mid-2019.

**As for what lies ahead**: "The next round of this will be how the industry evolves to meet the domestic crisis," says Margy Osmond. "It’s desperate times but people are thinking creatively, like serviced apartment companies doing ‘lock and drop’ isolation packages – where you book in and they give you a special pack that tells you all the things you have to do and the services they provide."

Grounded Qantas planes suddenly seem a handy charter option as all others evaporate for Australians stranded around the world.

Longer term, the prognosis depends on the length of the shutdown and "what part of the market you look at", Osmond says. "Young people will be the first back. The issue, though, may be the Australian dollar, which is pretty grim at the moment [US61 cents at the time of writing]. I can’t see that getting much better, so there’s potentially a great boost for domestic travel. Maybe that bump is going to be in six months rather than now."

University of Queensland Business School’s associate professor Gabby Walters remains upbeat, even as fears grow of further waves of the virus hitting from returning travellers in various cities around the world. "Tourism won’t fundamentally change," she says. "There will be some who will be psychologically scarred by this but the majority will be champing at the bit to travel as soon as it’s over."

Mair agrees but muses that "images of the canals of Venice running clear and the air pollution above Beijing clearing" during shutdowns may fuel existing opposition to over-tourism and a longer-term push toward sustainable tourism.

Is it possible a new norm might even evolve? One premised on a less blithely and confidently mobile and travel-crazed public than prevailed during the boom decades?

"I don’t think that we know the answer," Tourism Australia’s Phillipa Harrison says. "We are certainly, from a branding point of view, looking at what that ‘normal’ looks like. Because we have to make sure that we are tapping into global consumer sentiment and [how] this event will affect it. We don’t know but we are going to spend a bit of effort finding out."

"The correction could be more about what people’s expectations are of their destination or the place they stay or who they fly with," says Margy Osmond. " ‘Are you a sustainable industry? Are you using bio-fuels? As a hotel, how do you manage your waste? As a travel company, do you have a zero-carbon attitude? Can I offset when I buy? If I’m coming to a conference, can I go out and do some volunteer tourism?’ It’s going to lead to a whole new stratum within the market of different kinds of travel expectations."

Those are, of course, quintessential values and concerns of the younger generations that have come of age since the turn of the millennium, children of a globalised world, for whom travel is less a rite of passage than a way of being. As a cohort, they continued to defy COVID-19 all the way to an increasingly bitter end, which is one reason they predominate among the stranded citizen-journalists broadcasting from locked-down cities such as Cusco in Peru.

"The youth market was the last to stop travelling and it’ll be the first to start again when this is over," says Ryan Hanly, co-founder of the peer-to-peer social-media app Travello, who watched his customers carrying on in real time all the way up to the travel bans.

Launched in Queensland four years ago,[Travello](https://travelloapp.com/) – which connects travellers and allows them to book in-destination tours and activities – has 800,000 active users, a quarter of them Australian, across 180 countries. Both its user numbers and revenue, which comes from booking commissions and partner operator dues, have doubled in each of its four years, including – despite COVID-19 – the first few months of this year, Hanly says.

"Our target market is 18-32 and we saw no impact until a week ago," he says on March 24. "We then made a moral and ethical call to stop marketing experiences." Even so, message traffic among Travello’s community of users has been up 12 per cent in the week since.

"They’re continuing to use the app," Hanly says. "People in isolation are looking to connect with others in the same situation, posting where they would rather be or where they were a month ago."
