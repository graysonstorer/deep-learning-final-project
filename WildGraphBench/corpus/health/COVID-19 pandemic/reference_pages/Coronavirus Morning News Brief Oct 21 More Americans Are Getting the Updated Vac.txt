A dose of the original Moderna vaccine

Good morning. This is Jonathan Spira reporting. Here now the news of the pandemic from across the globe on the 925th day of the pandemic.

The United States recorded its 99 millionth case at some point on Thursday, outdistancing the country in the Nr. 2 slot, India, by more than 100% and it’s noteworthy that the United States has a far smaller population to begin with.

It’s good news, then, that the United States is one of the few nations to have authorized a reformulated bivalent mRNA vaccine that addresses two currently prevalent – but slowly dying off – sublineages of the omicron variant, BA.4 and BA.5, although the vaccine program got off to a slow start.

In the first three weeks, approximately 7.5 million people received the new jab, but the good news is that, in the most recent three-week period, there was a 60% increase to almost 12 million, bringing the total to have been inoculated with the bivalent vaccine to almost 20 million people. The bad news is that this is still less than 10% of the eligible population.

Half of the 20 million shots have thus far been given to individuals 65 years of age or older, a population that is among the most vulnerable to the virus.

It’s great progress but there’s clearly more arms to be bared, especially with a threat of a twindemic of Covid and a particularly nasty flu season coming up.

In other news we cover today, Spain is dropping its pandemic entry restrictions for visitors, the last country in Europe to do so; the BA.5 variant continues to be dominant in the United States; and iPhone maker Foxconn is introducing new restrictions for its largest iPhone plant in China.

UNITED STATES
-------------

The BA.5 subvariant continues to be dominant in the United States, making up 67.9% of all cases in the week ending October 15. The CDC reported that 19% of people in the country live in a location where the Covid transmission levels are either medium and high. Masking is advised in areas with high Covid transmission.Meanwhile, 81% live in areas where community transmission is considered low.

Drugmaker Pfizer, which plans to sell its mRNA coronavirus commercially perhaps as early as next year, is reportedly planning a price of at least $110 per dose. The final price will be determined as negotiations with health insurance companies continue.

GLOBAL
------

In the United Kingdom, over two million people were suffering from Covid in early October. One in 30 people in England and one in 25 in Wales were infected.

Citing low demand, vaccine maker Serum Institute of India said it had to destroy 100 million doses of vaccine that had expired. The vaccine was only 70% effective against symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 cases, while vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna were over 90% effective.

TECH
----

IPhone manufacturer Foxconn imposed its own restrictions on its plant in Zhengzhou as a fresh wave of cases struck the city. It is closing its cafeteria and asking workers to take their meals back to their dormitories, according to a notice on the factory’s official WeChat account. The company will offer three meals per day to workers.

**TRAVEL**
----------

Spain is ending all coronavirus pandemic-related travel restrictions ahead of a half-term holiday in British schools. Spain is a favorite destination among Britons. Travelers 12 years of age or over will no longer need to show proof of vaccination, a negative test, or recovery from Covid within the previous six months to enter the country. The changes went into effect Thursday.

The country was the last in Europe to drop such restrictions.

**TODAY’S STATISTICS**
----------------------

Now here are the daily statistics for Friday, October 21.

As of Friday morning, the world has recorded 632.2 million Covid-19 cases, an increase of 0.5 million cases, and 6.6 million deaths, according to Worldometer, a service that tracks such information.In addition, 610.9 million people worldwide have recovered from the virus, an increase of 0.9 million.

Worldwide, the number of active coronavirus cases as of Friday is 14,634,764, an increase of 90,000. Out of that figure, 99.7%, or 14,596,117, are considered mild, and 0.3%, or 38,647, are listed as critical. The percentage of cases considered critical has not changed over the past 24 hours.

The United States reported 63,637 new coronavirus infections on Friday for the previous day, compared to 68,420 on Thursday, 28,124 on Wednesday, 46,146 on Tuesday, 7,040 on Monday, 2,776 on Sunday, 29,069 on Saturday, and 75,172 on Fri day, according to data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The 7-day incidence rate is now 35,060. Figures for the weekend (reported the following day) are typically 30% to 60% of those posted on weekdays due to a lower number of tests being conducted.

The average daily number of new coronavirus cases in the United States over the past 14 days is 38,007, an 8% decrease, based on data from the Department of Health and Human Services, among other sources. The average daily death toll over the same period is 360, a decrease of 7% over the same period, while the average number of hospitalizations for the period was 26,669, a 2% decrease.

In addition, since the start of the pandemic the United States has, as of Friday, recorded 99 million cases, a higher figure than any other country, and a death toll of 1.1 million. India has the world’s second highest number of officially recorded cases, 44.6 million, and a reported death toll of 528,953.

The newest data from Russia’s Rosstat state statistics service showed that, at the end of July, the number of Covid or Covid-related deaths since the start of the pandemic there in April 2020 is now 823,623, giving the country the world’s second highest pandemic-related death toll, behind the United States. Rosstat reported that 3,284 people died from the coronavirus or related causes in July, down from 5,023 in June, 7,008 in May and 11,583 in April.

Meanwhile, France is the country with the third highest number of cases, with 36.5 million, and Germany is in the number four slot, with 35.1 million total cases.

Brazil, which has recorded the third highest number of deaths as a result of the virus, 687,544, has recorded over 34.8 million cases, placing it in the number five slot.

The other five countries with total case figures over the 20 million mark are South Korea, with 25.2 million cases, the United Kingdom, with 23.9 million cases, placing it in the number seven slot, and Italy, with 23.3 million, as number eight, as well as Japan, with 21.9 million, and Russia, with 21.4 million.

**VACCINATION SPOTLIGHT**
-------------------------

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that, as of Thursday, over 265.6 million people in the United States – or 80% – have received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Of that population, 68.2%, or 226.6 million people, have received two doses of vaccine, and the total number of doses that have been dispensed in the United States is now 632.9 million.Breaking this down further, 91% of the population over the age of 18 – or 234.9 million people –has received at least a first inoculation and 78% of the same group – or 201.4 million people –is fully vaccinated. In addition, 52.3% of that population, or 105.3 million people, has already received a first booster dose of vaccine.

Starting on June 13, 2022, the CDC began to update vaccine data on a weekly basis and publish the updated information on Friday by 8 p.m. EDT, a statement on the agency’s website said.

Some 68.4% of the world population has received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine by Friday, according to Our World in Data, an online scientific publication that tracks such information. So far, 12.85 billion doses of the vaccine have been administered on a global basis and 2.09 million doses are now administered each day.

Meanwhile, only 23.3% of people in low-income countries have received one dose, while in countries such as Canada, China, Denmark, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States, at least 75% of the population has received at least one dose of vaccine.

Only a handful of the world’s poorest countries – Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia and Nepal – have reached the 70% mark in vaccinations. Many countries, however, are under 20% and, in countries such as Haiti, Senegal, and Tanzania, for example, vaccination rates remain at or below 10%.

In addition, with the start of vaccinations in North Korea in late September, Eritrea remains the only country in the world that has not administered vaccines.

 That’s probably what Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian is thinking, reflecting on his appearance on a news segment on the television program “CBS Mornings” before the Fourth of July.

 The hostess, Gayle King, began by asking: “Is Delta ready, how do you know you’re prepared?” referencing the summer travel season, adding “this is the part where you say, ‘no Gayle, we not …
