Abstract
--------

COVID-19 has brought the air transportation sector to a standstill. The purpose of this study is to assess COVID-19′s impact on domestic U.S. air travel operations and commercial airport service in light of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which offered financial assistance to air carriers and put in place requirements to maintain service to domestic cities served pre-pandemic. This study is based on air traffic data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics. Findings show that performed departures decreased by 71.5% in May 2020 compared to May 2019. The number of domestic U.S. markets served between commercial airports decreased by 32.1% during the same time as airlines modified their networks. Domestic air service reductions were not uniform. Airlines decreased their departure operations at larger airports more than at non-primary airports (73.7% versus 39.2%). Additionally, large origin airports experienced a greater decline in domestic U.S. markets served compared to non-primary (35.3% versus 11.8%). Markets served by airports in multi-airport cities decreased more than airports in single-airport cities (38.5% versus 15.8%). These trends provide insight into how airlines’ responses to the pandemic have impacted service at U.S. airports, even with CARES Act regulations in place.

1. Introduction
---------------

The global COVID-19 pandemic has brought the air transportation sector to a standstill in a matter of months, with demand plummeting for both domestic and international travel. As COVID-19 spread across the globe, businesses and schools moved online to reduce virus exposure, unemployment rates skyrocketed ([BLS, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0045)), travel restrictions were implemented, and the highly contagious nature of COVID-19 made people uneasy about traveling. By mid-March 2020, air travel began to drop dramatically throughout the world ([Iacus et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0135), [Suau-Sanchez et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0195)). International air travel experienced a sharp decline, with year-over-year available seat kilometers decreasing by approximately 90% in April 2020 ([Suau-Sanchez et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0195)). Other forms of transportation have also been significantly impacted, including travel by way of [public transit](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/public-transport "Learn more about public transit from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), driving, walking ([Baker et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0035), [Bucsky, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0040), [De Vos, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0085), [Hadjidemetriou et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0130)), taxi ([Nian et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0165)) and cruise ships ([Ito et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0140)).

Worldwide, airlines have faced huge revenue losses. Airlines reported a net loss of $5.2 billion in the first quarter of 2020 ([BTS, 2020a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0060)). The U.S. government intervened and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 and provided $50 billion in financial assistance to passenger carriers and $8 billion to cargo carriers through a combination of loans, loan guarantees, and payroll support (U.S. [Congress, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0200))[1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#fn1). All 10 of the largest U.S. passenger carriers[2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#fn2) signed agreements to receive financial support through the CARES Act, along with over 340 smaller passenger carriers[3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#fn3) ([U.S. DT, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0240)). In return, the air carriers who received financial assistance must maintain certain requirements. They are prohibited from reducing the pay rates of employees or involuntary furloughing workers, and some of these air carriers are also required to maintain a minimum level of service[4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#fn4) to domestic cities served pre-pandemic until September 30, 2020 (U.S. [Congress, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0200), [U.S. Department of Transportation, 2020a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0210)).

Although there remains much uncertainty about how long the COVID-19 pandemic will persist and how long it will take air transportation to recover, many experts believe the impacts will be long-term. According to [industry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/industry "Learn more about industry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") leaders, recovery is expected to be at least 3 to 6 years (e.g., [Josephs, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0145), [Sobieralski, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0180)). This is not the first event to cause a major downturn in air travel. For example, during the [Great Recession](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/global-economic-crisis "Learn more about Great Recession from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of 2008, airlines altered their operational strategies and networks post-Recession ([Atallah et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0025)). The number of U.S. airports with commercial service dropped from 522 airports in 2008 to 499 airports in 2012 ([FAA, 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0095), [FAA, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0100)). There were 23 airports that lost all service by commercial carriers, and most were airports in small communities. The years surrounding the Great Recession were also a time of much airline consolidation. Six large U.S. carriers went through mergers/acquisitions, specifically Delta-Northwest in 2008, United-Continental in 2010, and Southwest-AirTran in 2011.

In addition to the 2008 Great Recession, events such as the 9/11 attacks in 2001 and SARS in 2003 also precipitated a shock to the air system. These prior events of uncertainty can provide insights into the recovery from future shock events in the airline industry. For instance, [Sobieralski (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0180) used past uncertainty shocks to forecast COVID-19 related decreases in U.S. airline employment and estimated a post-pandemic decline of 7% of the airline workforce (or 32,000 employees).

What is clear from past downturns is that demand for air travel will eventually bounce back. However, the industry will likely emerge from this crisis significantly altered. During periods of air travel downturn, flight operations and airport service levels are areas of concern, as airlines face reduced demand which impacts their network planning strategies and the markets they choose to fly. Airport service can be impacted when airlines alter their markets served, shift their networks and flight frequencies, or consolidate. Service to airports located in small communities are of particular concern, as they have been shown to be the most at risk of losing service ([U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0245), [Spitz et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0190), [Atallah and Hotle, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0020)).

The purpose of this paper is to review COVID-19′s impact on domestic U.S. air travel operations and commercial airport service during the months immediately following COVID-19. The pandemic’s impact on the nation’s air travel and operations is analyzed first. Then, airline responses to the pandemic are explored by investigating how airlines have altered their airports and markets served. Here, the objective is to quantify how airlines’ responses to the pandemic impacted service at U.S. airports.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: [2 Methodology](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#s0010), [3 Data](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#s0015) discuss the analysis methodology and data used, respectively. [Section 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#s0020) provides an overview of how the pandemic has impacted the air travel industry ([Section 4.1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#s0025)), and then examines how individual airports have been impacted differently depending on their characteristics, such as airport size ([Section 4.2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#s0030)) and multi-airport city status ([Section 4.3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#s0035)). This section offers reasons for differences that are found, especially regarding the CARES Act requirements. [Section 5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#s0040) provides a discussion around policy implications of the findings and offers ideas for future research on the impacts of COVID-19 on air travel and transportation, in general.

2. Methodology
--------------

To capture the effects of COVID-19 on domestic U.S. air travel, this study used the time period of January 2019-May 2020 to [analyze trends](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/trend-analysis "Learn more about analyze trends from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") in number of monthly departure operations, including scheduled departures and performed departures. To account for the seasonality of air travel, when percent changes in operational metrics are reported and discussed, year-over-year changes for a particular month are used. In particular, May year-over-year changes are used when percent changes in domestic markets are reported and discussed. The month of May was used because the CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020 (U.S. [Congress, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0200)), and airlines spent April 2020 adapting their schedules to the regulations set in place (e.g., modifying their networks and flight frequencies).

To analyze COVID-19′s market-level impact on commercial U.S. airport service, this study calculates the number of domestic markets that are served before and after the beginning of the pandemic. Looking at changes in the number of markets served reveals whether the connectivity of the nation’s air transportation system was significantly impacted by the pandemic. A market is defined as a unique origin to destination airport-pair. For example, origin airport ATL (Atlanta, GA) to destination airport LAS (Las Vegas, NV) is defined as one unique market served. For the reverse trip, origin airport LAS to destination airport ATL is defined as a separate unique market. Some markets in the dataset are only occasionally observed to have scheduled departures, so a minimum service requirement was included. For a market to be counted as “served,” it had to have at least 4 flights performed during the month (i.e., an average of one flight per week). This level of service is consistent with the CARES Act[5](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#fn5). The calculation of the percentage change in the number of markets served before and after the beginning of the pandemic was made for each U.S. airport[6](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#fn6). Differences across airports are analyzed by looking at trends in light of airport characteristics such as airport size and multi-airport city status.

3. Data
-------

This study is based on airline operational datasets that are publicly available through the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) websites. The primary dataset used in the analysis is the T-100 domestic segment data for January 2019-May 2020[7](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#fn7). The scope of this analysis includes all domestic U.S. flights (including Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories) that are reported as scheduled passenger service in the dataset[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#fn8). This segment dataset counts passengers by each flight leg of a trip and is reported by airlines on a monthly basis ([BTS, 2020b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0065)). Because origin and destination airport combinations are reported, it is possible to look at how airline networks change over time. Although all of these metrics are used to some degree in this paper, the focus will be on airline service rather than passenger demand. Using airline service as the focus allows the findings of this paper to be clearly compared to requirements of the CARES Act, which also focused on service (rather than demand) by mandating that airlines maintain a minimum level of service to domestic cities served pre-pandemic, regardless of how many passengers chose to travel.

T-100 captures most, but not all, scheduled air service. The large airlines are required to report to T-100 monthly. However, the smaller airlines do so on a voluntary basis ([BTS, 2007](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0050)). The number of airlines reporting to the T-100 can change from month-to-month for various reasons, including airline consolidation or voluntary reporters who do not consistently report. In the study period, 66 airlines reported scheduled passenger service in May 2019 and 52 in May 2020. However, it is expected that missing data from airlines who voluntarily report will have little impact on the results, as these small airlines account for less than 0.15% of the performed departures (based on May 2019 data).

All commercial U.S. service airports were included in this analysis (including those in Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories). As a secondary data source to the T-100, the commercial airport size categories provided by the FAA were used to distinguish airports of differing sizes ([FAA, 2020b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0110), [FAA, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0105)). The FAA defines airports as large-hub, medium-hub, small-hub, non-hub, and non-primary using the number of annual commercial enplanements[9](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#fn9).

Lastly, this study incorporated BTS’s Master Coordinate table ([BTS, 2020c](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0070)). The table has a city market identification field which groups airports BTS considers to be in the same city market (for example, the airports within the New York City market). This multi-airport city market definition is consistent with the one used to calculate the minimum service requirements that airlines are required to follow as part of the CARES Act ([U.S. DOT, 2020a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0210)).

[Descriptive statistics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/descriptive-statistics "Learn more about Descriptive statistics from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") on the final analysis dataset are provided in [Table 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#t0005) and calculated at the month-level on the 17 months of data. In an average month, for example, there were 62 airlines. On average 57.9 million passengers were transported per month but varies widely from a minimum of 2.9 million passengers per month to a maximum of 75.9 million passengers per month. Large variation is observed because the study period includes data before and after the beginning of COVID-19. The months during these two time periods are analyzed separately in the remainder of this study.

The next subsection ([Section 4.1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#s0025)) provides an overall view of COVID-19′s impact on air travel and operations. Afterwards, the remaining two subsections ([4.2 Impact of COVID-19 on Airports of Differing Size](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#s0030), [4.3 Impact of COVID-19 on Airports in Multi- and Single-Airport Cities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#s0035)) discuss how airlines’ responses to the pandemic impacted service at U.S. airports.

### 4.1. Impact of COVID-19 on Domestic U.S. Air Travel Operations

To capture the effects of COVID-19 on domestic U.S. air travel, the analysis first looks at trends in monthly operations and service. [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#f0005) provides the total monthly scheduled departures and performed departures from January 2019 to May 2020. Viewed another way, [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#t0010) provides a summary of these metrics for March-May in both 2019 and 2020, and the year-over-year percentage change is also included for each month.

Table 2. Domestic U.S. Air Travel Summary, March-May 2019 and 2020.

| Empty Cell | 2019 | 2020 | Percent change 2019 to 2020 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| March | April | May | March | April | May | March | April | May |
| Passengers (million) | 70.7 | 67.4 | 71.9 | 34.6 | 2.9 | 8.3 | −51.0% | −95.7% | −88.4% |
| Performed Departures (thousand) | 716 | 694 | 725 | 608 | 211 | 207 | −15.0% | −69.6% | −71.5% |
| Scheduled Departures (thousand) | 719 | 697 | 727 | 712 | 335 | 212 | −1.0% | −52.0% | −70.8% |
| Load Factor | 0.84 | 0.83 | 0.85 | 0.48 | 0.12 | 0.37 | −42.9% | −85.3% | −56.4% |
| Markets Served | 6262 | 6141 | 6199 | 6192 | 4505 | 4211 | −1.1% | −26.6% | −32.1% |

_Note_: Load factor is calculated as number of passengers divided by number of seats.

The trend lines in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#f0005) show the large decrease in both performed and scheduled departures that happened after the pandemic began. The first case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was confirmed on January 20, 2020 in Washington state ([CDC, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0080)). It was not until March that U.S. domestic travel was heavily impacted. In fact, there was a 5.1% increase in performed departures in January 2020 as compared to January 2019. However, there was a 15.0% decrease in performed departures in March 2020 as compared to March 2019, which is the month that the first large decrease was observed. By April 2020, there was a 69.6% year-over-year drop in performed departures. The quick impact of this unexpected event is evident in the disconnect between the scheduled departures and performed departures from March to April 2020, which is shown in [Fig. 1](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#f0005) where the trend lines diverge. A large gap is seen between scheduled and performed departures in March and April 2020, but by May 2020 the trend lines are more in agreement. It appears that it took airlines a couple of months to adjust their schedules after the pandemic began.

[Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#t0010) also shows that demand for air travel decreased significantly after the pandemic began. The total number of passengers transported had year-over-year decreases of 51.0% in March 2020, 95.7% in April 2020 and 88.4% in May 2020. These drastic decreases in domestic passenger traffic have been widely reported in media, and BTS has indicated that this is the largest drop in passenger traffic on record ([BTS, 2020d](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0075)). Because of the imbalance of supply and demand, load factors were also significantly impacted by the pandemic. Planes flew with an average load factor of 0.48 in March 2020 as the pandemic hit mid-month, a low of 0.12 in April 2020, and back up again to 0.37 in May 2020 as airlines adjusted flight schedules. These load factors are significantly lower than is typically observed as load factors for 2019 were on average 0.85.

Lastly, [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#t0010) shows that airline networks changed significantly after the pandemic began. For example, there were 6,141 unique domestic U.S. markets that were served in April 2019. However, the number of markets served dropped to 4,505 in April 2020, representing a decrease of 26.6%. Moreover, the decrease in the number of markets served was even larger in May 2020, representing a year-over-year decrease of 32.1%. These large decreases in the number of markets served reveals that connectivity of the nation’s air transportation system was significantly impacted by the pandemic. Initially, this finding may seem somewhat counterintuitive when considering the recent government focus on maintaining service. The CARES Act required that air carriers receiving financial assistance maintain a minimum level of service to domestic cities served pre-pandemic. However, this only required that airlines maintain a minimum number of flights from domestic city origins served pre-pandemic. The CARES Act did not stipulate what destinations or how many destinations airlines should fly to. Airlines were free to change their networks (and destinations served) as long as they maintained the minimum required number of flights. Additionally, the minimum service requirements applied only to cities served pre-pandemic rather than airports served pre-pandemic. In other words, airlines serving multiple origin airports in a city (New York City, for example) were only required to maintain service at one of those airports. The next two sections will further analyze how airline responses to the pandemic impacted airport service.

### 4.2. Impact of COVID-19 on Airports of Differing Size

While the effects of COVID-19 drastically reduced domestic airline service, the magnitude of these impacts have not been uniform across all commercial airports. The trend lines in [Fig. 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#f0010) show the total number of performed departures, disaggregated by origin airport size. Comparing May 2020 with May 2019, the total number of performed departures decreased by 73.7% at large hub airports, 72.9% at medium hubs, 69.4% at small hubs, 62.2% at non-hubs and 39.2% at non-primary airports. This indicates that airlines decreased their departure operations at larger airports more than at smaller airports, which can be explained by the CARES Act minimum service requirements[10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#fn10). The pre-COVID-19 number of departures at smaller airports, especially at non-primary airports, are closer to the minimum service requirements than at the large hub airports. This prevented airlines from reducing their operations as much at the smaller airports. For example, comparing airports located in single-airport cities, the large-hub Charlotte Airport in North Carolina (CLT) had an average of 4,927 scheduled flights per week in 2019, but the CARES Act minimum service requirements only required airlines serving that airport to maintain 32 total flights per week across all airlines ([U.S. DOT, 2020a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0210)). Alternatively, the non-primary Kearney Regional Airport in Nebraska (EAR) had an average of 13 scheduled flights per week in 2019, but the CARES Act minimum service requirements required the one airline serving that airport to maintain 3 flights per week ([U.S. DOT, 2020a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0210)).

Fig. 2. Performed Departures by Airport Size, January 2019 to May 2020.

Previously, [Table 2](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#t0010) demonstrated that the total number of unique domestic U.S. markets served dropped significantly after the beginning of COVID-19, with the number of markets served decreasing by 32.1% year-over-year in May 2020. However, that statistic is heavily influenced by the largest airports and does not explain what happened across the hundreds of airports in the U.S. [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#t0015) provides [descriptive statistics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/descriptive-statistics "Learn more about descriptive statistics from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for the percentage change in the number of markets served, by origin airports of differing size. Within each category, the number of airports and the average number of markets served are also provided. [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#t0015) shows that the average airport in the U.S. experienced a 17.7% decrease in its number of markets served in May 2020 as compared to May 2019. However, the percent change in number of markets served depended on the size of the airport. Large, medium, and small hubs lost the largest percentage of their service (35.2% − 41.6% on average). On the other hand, non-hub and non-primary airports lost the smallest percentage of their service (10.8% − 11.8% on average, respectively).

Table 3. Percent Change in Number of Domestic Markets by Airport Size.

| Origin Airport Size | Number of Airports | Average Markets 2019 | Descriptive Statistics for Percent Change in Markets Served |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mean | P 25 | Median | P 75 | CV |
| Large Hubs | 30 | 94 | −35.3% | −43.5% | −29.0% | −21.8% | −0.52 |
| Medium Hubs | 31 | 38 | −41.6% | −50.0% | −40.9% | −32.4% | −0.26 |
| Small Hubs | 69 | 17 | −35.2% | −45.5% | −36.8% | −23.5% | −0.61 |
| Non-Hubs | 255 | 3 | −10.8% | −33.3% | 0.0% | 0.0% | −3.81 |
| Non-Primary, Non-Hubs | 116 | 2 | −11.8% | −25.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | −2.50 |
| All Airports | 501 | 13 | −17.7% | −40.0% | −9.1% | 0.0% | −2.01 |

_Notes_: The percent change is calculated by comparing May 2019 to May 2020. P25=25th percentile; P75=75th percentile; [CV](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/measure-of-dispersion "Learn more about CV from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages")=Coefficient of variation.

This result is quite interesting and may seem initially counter-intuitive based on literature that has shown small airports are more at risk of losing service [U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0245), [Spitz et al., 2015](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0190)). However, this finding can again be explained within the context of the CARES Act minimum service requirements. The airlines servicing larger airports were allowed to reduce their flight departures significantly while still maintaining the CARES Act minimum service requirements, and they could choose to implement that service reduction across any of their many markets served from a given city (each large hub airport had 94 markets on average in 2019). On the other hand, the airlines servicing smaller airports were not allowed to reduce their flight departures as much, and at the same time, they could only implement that service reduction across a small number of markets (each non-primary non-hub airport had 2 markets on average in 2019). In other words, the CARES Act minimum service requirements created a non-uniform impact on the number of markets that must be maintained from airports of different sizes.

To give a better picture of the distribution across airports, [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#t0015) also provides the 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile and [coefficient of variation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/measure-of-dispersion "Learn more about coefficient of variation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (CV). Looking at the CV in [Table 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#t0015) reveals that the percentage change in markets served is much more dispersed for non-hubs (CV=-3.81 to -2.50) as compared to hubs (CV=-0.61 to -0.26). In fact, the majority of non-hubs lost no service at all (median=0%), while some non-hubs lost all service. A further investigation reveals that 209 airports lost no markets; all were non-hubs except for one small hub airport. On the other hand, 12 airports lost all markets in May 2020 as compared to May 2019, and all of these were non-hubs (not shown in table). This further demonstrates the wide dispersion of service impacts for non-hubs.

It is interesting to see that 12 airports lost all service after the pandemic, as the minimum service requirements of the CARES Act were meant to protect cities from losing all service. However, airlines are allowed to request service exemptions for specific cities, allowing the airline to suspend service, and a limited number have been approved by the U.S. DOT ([U.S. DOT, 2020b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0215)). A closer look reveals that these airports lost service for multiple reasons, including a carrier (Ravn Air) that went bankrupt and ceased operations shortly after the pandemic started, along with several service exemptions that were granted for airlines mainly due to officials requesting that service be temporarily suspended in response to the pandemic[11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#fn11).

### 4.3. Impact of COVID-19 on Airports in Multi- and Single-Airport Cities

In addition to airport size, the number of commercial airports in a city is another factor that impacted airline service after COVID-19 began. [Fig. 3](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#f0015) shows that the total number of performed departures between two multi-airport cities decreased by 77.4% between May 2019 and May 2020. The total number of performed departures between a multi-airport city and a single-airport city decreased by 73.0%, and between two single-airport cities decreased by 64.8%. This indicates that airlines decreased their departure operations at airports in multi-airport cities more than in single-airport cities.

Fig. 3. Performed Departures by City Type, January 2019 to May 2020.

To analyze this trend further, [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#t0020) provides [descriptive statistics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/descriptive-statistics "Learn more about descriptive statistics from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") for the percentage change in the number of markets served, based on origin airports of differing size and also categorizes them into single-airport and multi-airport cities. [Table 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#t0020) shows that the number of markets served at airports in multi-airport cities decreased by 38.5% on average, as compared to single-airport cities which decreased by 15.8%. Airports in every size category within multi-airport cities experienced larger decreases on average than their single-airport counterparts. For example, the multi-airport city large hubs lost an average of 36.2% of service, whereas single-airport city large hubs lost 33.6% of service.

Table 4. Percent Change in Number of Domestic Markets by Airport Size and City Type.

| Origin Airport Size & Type City | Number of Airports | Average Markets 2019 | Descriptive statistics for percent change in markets served |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mean | P 25 | Median | P 75 | CV |
| Large Hubs | Multi Airport | 19 | 89 | −36.2% | −43.5% | −29.5% | −21.8% | −0.53 |
|  | Single Airport | 11 | 102 | −33.6% | −49.1% | −25.7% | −21.6% | −0.52 |
| Medium Hubs | Multi Airport | 11 | 35 | −42.5% | −51.0% | −40.9% | −31.3% | −0.25 |
|  | Single Airport | 20 | 39 | −41.1% | −49.0% | −40.2% | −32.5% | −0.27 |
| Small Hubs | Multi Airport | 8 | 23 | −44.5% | −66.4% | −50.7% | −19.5% | −0.71 |
|  | Single Airport | 61 | 17 | −34.0% | −43.8% | −36.4% | −23.5% | −0.59 |
| Non-Hubs | Multi Airport | 6 | 6 | −30.1% | −55.6% | −25.0% | 0.0% | −1.54 |
|  | Single Airport | 249 | 3 | −10.3% | −33.3% | 0.0% | 0.0% | −3.97 |
| Non-Primary, | Multi Airport | – | – | – | – | – | – | – |
| Non-Hubs | Single Airport | 116 | 2 | −11.8% | −25.0% | 0.0% | 0.0% | −2.50 |
| All Airports | Multi Airport | 44 | 52 | −38.5% | −52.7% | −40.1% | −26.0% | −0.64 |
|  | Single Airport | 457 | 9 | −15.8% | −38.9% | 0.0% | 0.0% | −2.28 |

_Notes_: The percent change is calculated by comparing May 2019 to May 2020. P25=25th percentile; P75=75th percentile; CV=Coefficient of variation. There are no airports in multi-airport cities that are defined as Non-Primary, Non-Hubs.

Again, this could be the impact of the CARES Act minimum service requirements, which defines service to “points” or cities, rather than airports (U.S. [Congress, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0200)). Airlines were only required to maintain service at one airport within a multi-airport city and could choose to consolidate operations to one airport. An interesting case is the New York City market, where large differences are observed in its three large hub airports. The number of markets served declined by 53.8% at JFK, 59.5% at EWR, and 79.7% at LGA. This demonstrates that airports of similar sizes within the same multi-city market could experience quite different declines in their service levels.

5. Conclusions and Policy Implications
--------------------------------------

This study assessed the impacts of COVID-19 on domestic U.S. air travel operations and commercial airport service. Even though the CARES Act required airlines to continue service, it defined service to “points” or cities, rather than airports, and it also did not have restrictions on markets served. Airlines were free to change their networks as long as they maintained minimum service requirements. Although the CARES Act provided financial support for the air transportation sector, the design of the airline regulations led to non-uniform impacts on airports. The airlines servicing larger airports were allowed to reduce their flight departures much more than at smaller airports. This led to greater service reductions at larger airports than at smaller airports. Additionally, airports in multi-airport cities experienced a greater decline in service than airports in single-airport cities, even after accounting for airport size.

In the short term, the CARES Act has successfully shielded the smallest airports from losing service by implementing minimum service restrictions. Once these regulations are lifted, airlines will be free to make decisions based on financial profitability. It is possible that many small airports will lose service, as was seen in after the [Great Recession](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/global-economic-crisis "Learn more about Great Recession from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") of 2008 ([Atallah et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0025), [FAA, 2009](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0095), [FAA, 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0100)). However, some markets serving small communities will be helped by the government even after the minimum service requirements of the CARES Act are lifted. Specifically, to minimize the loss of service to small communities, airlines are subsidized when serving markets in the Essential Air Service (EAS) program[12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#fn12). As of February 2020, there were 110 communities in the continental U.S. eligible for EAS ([U.S. DOT, 2020c](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0220)). After the minimum service requirements of the CARES Act are lifted, it is possible that the number of communities eligible for EAS may need to be expanded due to the temporary decline in passengers ([U.S. DOT, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0205)).

As for multi-airport cities, the minimum service requirements of the CARES Act were implemented based on city-market groupings established by the BTS. The airport grouping algorithm is not public knowledge, but is clearly not solely distance-based. For example, Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR) and Westchester County Airport (HPN) are separated by a Great Circle Distance (GCD) of 35 miles and are in the same city market. However, Orlando International Airport (MCO) and Orlando Sanford International Airport (SFB) are 24 miles apart and not considered to be in the same city market. Having two airports 24 miles apart that are not considered to be in the same city market is concerning. If the goal of the CARES Act was to “take into consideration the air transportation needs of small and remote communities” and to “maintain well-functioning” health care and pharmaceutical [supply chains](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/supply-chain-management "Learn more about supply chains from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (U.S. [Congress, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0200)), then it seems that this metric was not defined in a way that was well-aligned with the goals of the regulations. As another point of concern, BTS does not publish the date that these definitions were last updated, so there is no way to know how recent these definitions are. In the future, there is a need for policies that support data transparency and clarity when creating regulations.

Lastly, COVID-19′s impact on the airline [industry](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/economics-econometrics-and-finance/industry "Learn more about industry from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") was sudden, and it appears that a plan was not in place for what to do in the event of a downturn such as this. Once the CARES Act was signed, the FAA needed to quickly interpret the law and set requirements for airlines. In the weeks that followed the FAA’s first set of minimum service requirements, several modifications and exemptions to the rules had to be made. For example, the original wording required airlines to continue serving all cities that they served during the last week of February 2019 and did not account for the seasonality of airline schedules ([U.S. DOT, 2020e](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0230)). This would have required that airlines continue serving cities in their peak winter schedules throughout spring and summer. Although this inconsistency and others were later amended ([U.S. Department of Transportation, 2020a](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0210), [U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT, 2020f](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0235)), the airline industry, which was already in a fragile financial state, was left waiting for guidance. Considering this, policies should be enacted to require government officials and analysts to have a pre-set plan for quickly reacting to shock events.

Going forward, much is still unknown at this time and will require future research to better understand the full impacts of COVID-19 on air travel. As such, there are many directions for future research. This study assessed domestic U.S. air travel operations and commercial airport service during the months immediately following the beginning of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Although the focus is on service, a similar study could focus on assessing the impacts of COVID-19 on passenger demand. Also, a fleet-level analysis could reveal how airlines responded to the pandemic in regard to changing their aircraft types flown on specific markets. It would be informative to do a similar study at the airline-level to better understand how individual airlines responded to the pandemic and modified their networks. Differing business models for network carriers and low-cost carrier may lead to some interesting insights about airlines’ responses to the pandemic. Other literature has quantified similarities and differences between network and low-cost carriers operational strategies (e.g., [Atallah et al., 2018](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0025), [Azadian and Vasigh, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0030)) and the pandemic provides an opportunity to study their responses to a large shock event.

Also, it will be interesting to assess the impacts on the air transportation network after the minimum service requirements of the CARES Act have been lifted. Airlines will be free to change their flight frequencies and markets served. In the long term, after the pandemic is over and airlines have once again increased service, an analysis could be done to identify characteristics of those markets that were discontinued and never resumed ([de Wit and Zuidberg, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0090)), which would help airport managers better understand how at-risk their airports are of losing service ([Atallah and Hotle, 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0020)). Some airlines may never resume service to markets that have been discontinued during the pandemic. Others may introduce new markets or even shift their operations to new hubs and focus cities. The CARES Act could have important implications for airport service and airline competition long-term (e.g. over the next decade), given its implications were non-uniform across the industry.

This study focused on domestic U.S. travel. International travel has been impacted greatly by travel restrictions of other governments ([Monmousseau et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0160)) and its ability to recover over time is an interesting area of future research, especially since passenger air travel has been found to be directly related to COVID-19 spread ([Sokadjo and Atchadé, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0185)). Once travel restrictions are lifted globally, an analysis could be conducted to see which markets recover first and how international travel of U.S. carriers has been impacted by COVID-19. It would also be informative to assess how U.S. carriers recover compared to their international counterparts on international markets given international carriers receive subsidies from their government, a benefit the U.S. carriers do not regularly receive ([Partnership for Open & Fair, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0170)). Similarly, future research avenues may explore airline crisis management ([Kao et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0150)) and policy issues surrounding government [resource allocation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/resource-allocation "Learn more about resource allocation from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and financial assistance ([Abate et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0010), [Forsyth et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0115), [Gössling, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0125), [Macilree and Duval, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0155)).

Finally, even though this study focused on air travel, there are broader implications for transportation in general. Future research can evaluate the time needed for other travel modes to react to COVID-19′s impact, such as [public transit](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/public-transport "Learn more about public transit from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages"), driving, walking ([Baker et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0035), [Bucsky, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0040), [De Vos, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0085), [Hadjidemetriou et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0130)) and taxi ([Nian et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0165)) where significant impacts have already been seen. Research aimed at improving preparedness for future shock events across all modes of travel is needed. Also, during COVID-19 recovery, travelers will perceive different levels of COVID-19 risk on each system that will likely impact demand. For example, using an agent-based model, [Wang et al. (2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0250) found that reopening New York transit to “100% transit capacity would only see as much as 73% of pre-COVID ridership and an increase in the number of car trips by as much as 142% of pre-pandemic levels.” Travel mode shifts in response to heightened risk perception was also noted by [Abdullah et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0015), [Shamshiripour et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0175) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This mode shift due to increased risk perception has been seen before where, in response to the events of September 11th, air travelers shifted to driving ([Gigerenzer, 2006](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0120)). Future demand modeling research can analyze the effectiveness of each transportation sector’s strategies to recover demand and pre-shock event schedules during a period of heightened risk perception.

2022, Transportation Research Interdisciplinary Perspectives  Show abstract The COVID-19 pandemic can be considered an unparalleled disruption to the aviation industry in the last century. Starting with an at-that-time inconceivable reduction in the number of flights from March 2020 to May 2020, the aviation industry has been trying to navigate through and out of the crisis. This process is accompanied with a significant number of scientific studies, reporting on the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on aviation and vice versa. This paper reviews the impacts in context of the recent literature. We have collected nearly 200 well-published papers on the subject in the years 2021/2022 and dissected them into a framework of eight categories, built around: airlines, airports, passengers, workforce, markets, contagion, sustainability, and economics. We highlight the essence of findings in the literature and derive a set of future research directions and policy considerations which we deem important on the way towards pandemic-resilient aviation.

2022, Transportation Research Part F Traffic Psychology and Behaviour  Show abstract A critical challenge facing transportation planners is to identify the type and the extent of changes in people’s activity-travel behavior in the post-Covid-19 pandemic world. In this study, we investigate the travel behavior evolution by analyzing a longitudinal two-wave panel survey data conducted in the United States from April 2020 to May 2021. Encompassing nearly 3,000 respondents across different states, we explored the effects of the pandemic on four major categories of work from home, travel mode choice, online shopping, and air travel. We utilized descriptive and econometric measures, including random effects ordered probit models, to shed light on the pandemic-induced changes and the underlying factors affecting the future of mobility in the post-pandemic world. Upon concrete evidence, our findings substantiate significant observed (i.e., during the pandemic) and expected (i.e., after the pandemic) changes in people’s habits and preferences. According to our results, 48% of the respondents anticipate having the option to WFH after the pandemic, which indicates an approximately 30% increase compared to the pre-pandemic period. In the post-pandemic period, auto and transit commuters are expected to be 9% and 31% less than pre-pandemic, respectively. A considerable rise in hybrid work and grocery online shopping is expected. Moreover, 41% of pre-covid business travelers expect to have fewer flights (after the pandemic) while only 8% anticipate more, compared to the pre-pandemic.

2022, Transport Reviews  Show abstract Governments all over the world have had to implement various policy measures in order to curb the spread of COVID-19, impacting many people's lives and livelihoods. Combinations of measures targeting the transportation sector and other aspects of social life have been implemented with varying degrees of success in different countries. This paper proposes a classification of COVID-19 measures aimed at passenger mobility. We distinguish the categories “avoidance of travel”, “modal shift” and “improvement of quality”. Per category, we distinguish different types of measures and effects (social, economic and environmental). Next, we review the literature on COVID-19 measures for passenger mobility, after which we discuss the policy relevance of our findings and propose a research agenda. We conclude that broad or integral assessments of measures on all socially relevant effects are rare. Also, few studies exist to determine the effects of individual measures and deal with combinations of measures instead. Studies on social or economic effects focus on partial direct effects (e.g. turnover of the transport sector, effect of mobility measures on commuter traffic) and do not elaborate on indirect effects (e.g. changes in household expenditure, stress levels). Finally, there is a greater focus in the literature on intermediary health indicators (e.g. travel behaviour) but less on the actual spread of COVID-19 or indeed on other indirect health effects of measures (e.g. due to air pollution, more exercise, etc).

2021, Transport Policy  Show abstract This paper studies the spatiotemporal variation of the worldwide air transportation network (WATN) induced by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The variations are captured from four perspectives: passenger throughput, network connectivity, airport centrality, and international connections. Further, this work also considers both global and local connectivity-based metrics for the network analysis. Supported by real-world data, we show that the performance of the WATN has experienced a dynamic pattern of decline and recovery in 2020. Interestingly, the network metrics undergo tremendous variations in a very short period after the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic, with the number of flights and connections dropping by more than 40% within only the first four weeks. Intuitively, the passenger throughput's changing rate is highly correlated to confirmed cases' growth rate during the early period of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, the air transport response to the pandemic condition is very diverse among different countries. The major airports in the WATN fluctuate gradually in different pandemic stages, which is further influenced by the domestic pandemic situation that restricts airport operations. Also, the restoration speed of local connectivity is faster than that of global connectivity because the recovery of international aviation is geographically dependent on different policies of travel restriction, conditional openings, and the number of COVID-19 cases. The analysis deepens our understanding to formulate bilateral policies for pandemic-induced ATN design and management.

2021, Sustainable Cities and Society  Show abstract This article maps the scientific literature in human mobility behavior in the context of the current pandemic. Through bibliometrics, we analyze the content of published scientific studies indexed on the Web of Science and Scopus during 2020. This enables us the detection of current hotspots and future directions of research. After a co-occurrence of keywords and evidence map analysis, four themes are identified, namely, Land Transport — Operations, Land Transport — Traffic Demand, Air Transport and Environment. We show how air transportation- and environmental-related studies tend to be more mature research whereas the understanding of changes in travel behavior (e.g., telecommuting, preventive measures or health protection behavior) tends to be immature. By using a topic modeling approach, we identify multiple sub-themes within each theme. Our framework adopts a smart literature review approach that can be constantly updated, enabling an analysis of many articles, with little investment of the researcher’s time, but also provides high degree of transparency and replicability. We also put forth a research agenda that can help inform and shape transport policy and practice responses to COVID-19.

In addition to the financial assistance provided to airlines, the CARES Act also provided assistance to airports. Federal funds for planned projects in the Airport Improvement Program were increased and new funding sources were provided for all airports that are part of the national airport system (FAA, 2020a). A workforce retention requirement was attached to the funding, requiring that airports continue to employ at least 90% of their employees through December 31, 2020 (FAA, 2020a).

One airport was excluded from the analysis, Williston Basin International Airport in North Dakota (XWA), because it did not have any service in May 2019 (it opened to the public on October 10, 2019). To make a fair comparison, voluntary-reporting airlines that failed to report in either May 2019 or 2020 were excluded in the market analysis. Airlines that seized operations during the COVID-19 pandemic were included.

The dataset used contains U.S. carriers only. May 2020 is the most recent data available at the time of analysis.

[8](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#bfn8)

T-100 records classified as cargo-only and/or non-scheduled service were excluded.

Commercial service airports are “publicly owned airports with at least 2,500 annual enplanements and scheduled air carrier service (§47102(7))” ([FAA, 2020b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0110), [FAA, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0105)). A large-hub airport has 1 percent or more of the annual U.S. commercial enplanements, where as a medium-hub airport has 0.25 to 1.0 percent, a small-hub airport has 0.05 to 0.25 percent, a non-hub airport has less than 0.05 percent but more than 10,000 enplanements, and a nonprimary airport has between 2,500 and 10,000 annual enplanements ([FAA, 2020b](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0110), [FAA, 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0105)).

[10](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#bfn10)

Another reasonable explanation for these differences observed could be that airlines responded to demand signals from the prior month (April 2020). In other words, they could have maintained more service where there was more demand. An analysis was performed on the percent change in passenger traffic from April 2019 to April 2020 as a function of airport size. Findings indicated that the decline in passenger traffic was uniform across all airport sizes.

[11](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#bfn11)

For example, the Governor of American Samoa requested that service be suspended to American Samoa ([U.S. DOT, 2020d](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#b0225)).

[12](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590198220301883#bfn12)

“This is generally accomplished by subsidizing two round trips a day with 30- to 50-seat aircraft, or additional frequencies with aircraft with 9-seat or fewer, usually to a large- or medium-hub airport” (U.S. DOT, 2017).
