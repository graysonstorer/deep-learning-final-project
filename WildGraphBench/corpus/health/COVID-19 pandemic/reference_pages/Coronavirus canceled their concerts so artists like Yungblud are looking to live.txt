PUBLISHED: March 15, 2020 at 10:35 AM PDT | UPDATED: March 15, 2020 at 10:54 AM PDT

**Getting your [Trinity Audio](https://trinityaudio.ai/) player ready...**

Uncertain times call for innovative measures, and English singer-songwriter Dominic Harrison, who goes by the moniker Yungblud, is ahead of the curve.

The 22-year-old artist, who was set to kick off his North American tour at [both weekends of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio in April](https://www.ocregister.com/2020/03/10/coachella-and-stagecoach-festivals-rescheduled-for-october/), has watched his concert dates drop off as they’re either canceled or postponed in the wake of the global spread of COVID-19.

As governments around the world mandate social distancing, Yungblud’s international tour dates have been postponed as well. In an effort to connect with his fans, Yungblud is one of the first major recording artists to announce [a live stream concert via his YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCd3Llj2WWJh8ItfYl32eJ4Q) at 7 a.m. PST Monday, March 16.

“The world is so weird right now, and it’s a really, really weird time of life,” he said via a phone chat over the weekend. “Magic just sort of happens in stages, and I had this idea since the opportunity to connect with my fans has been taken away from me because my shows are getting canceled left, right and center … I’m not going to just sit here in my house and twiddle my thumbs.”

Yungblud’s live stream will be broadcast from The Beehive Studios in Van Nuys, and rather than do a typical set, he’s opted to do it more like a late-night TV show where he’s the host.

“When I posted the idea, I had a lot of friends who were stuck at home too that were like, ‘Let us get in on this’,” he said.

The show will include performances and special guests, including his friend and [fellow artist Machine Gun Kelly](https://www.ocregister.com/2019/06/13/machine-gun-kelly-gives-us-the-dirt-on-his-new-album-hotel-diablo-before-coming-to-southern-california/), actress and singer Bella Thorne and singer-songwriter and producer Oliver Tree.

“We’re just trying to spread a bit of positivity to a negative situation right now,” he said. “I think the world is so topsy-turvy and dark right now. We want to provide a bit of light, fire and distraction and some happiness, too, man.”

Though Yungblud was among the first to get a jump on announcing a major live stream concert, other local, regional, national and international acts are quickly getting on board.

Vancouver’s Celtic [punk rock band The Real McKenzies](https://www.facebook.com/therealmckenzies/) live-streamed its performance in an empty venue Friday night via Facebook when its stop at The Starlite Room in Edmonton, Canada had abruptly been canceled.

Fullerton-based Burger Records, which was forced to cancel its daylong Burgerama 5 fest in Los Angeles on March 14, announced it would live-stream a concert with indie bands Shadow Show and This Uni from Burger Records since the artists were already in town for the show.

Boston-based [Irish punk rock band Dropkick Murphy’s announced on Saturday](https://www.facebook.com/DropkickMurphys/) that it would be streaming its annual St. Patrick’s Day show live via YouTube, Instagram and Facebook starting at 4 p.m. PST.

“For the first time in 24 years, we are not playing on St. Patrick’s Day weekend,” the band shared via its social media pages. “The current world situation is the only thing that would ever stop us from doing so.”

Orange County-based musicians Greta Valenti and Robin Davey, who are in local rock band Well Hung Heart and [blues-folk band Beaux Gris Gris & The Apocalypse](https://www.facebook.com/beauxgrisgris/), had to cancel spring tour dates in France for Beaux Gris Gris. That band also includes members who reside in the U.K., so, for now, they’ve decided to upload previously recorded concerts and new content via its social media pages.

“This is going to hurt so many people,” Valenti said via a phone chat. “No one can earn money right now. Everything is getting canceled and it’s not just the musicians that are being hurt – it’s the crews, the venues, the promoters.”

In some ways, Valenti said she feels like this situation will actually bring people closer together since social distancing has led to smaller groups congregating or people just staying in their homes.

“There will be a captive audience of bored people, and in some ways maybe this will be a good time for people to connect with each other in a more meaningful way through art,” she said. “Maybe there’s a way we can turn this into a positive thing and musicians can better connect with fans around the world. And people will be exhausted about hearing all of the negative things with the virus so maybe we can all band together, stay positive and use music for what it’s meant to be used for which is to get us through the hard times.”

Efrem Schulz, who fronts [Orange County hardcore punk band Death By Stereo](https://www.ocregister.com/2012/02/08/orange-pop-death-by-stereo-readies-sixth-disc/), [Chicano punk rock band Manic Hispanic](https://www.ocregister.com/2017/01/06/cadillac-tramps-and-manic-hispanic-frontman-mike-gabby-gaborno-dies-at-51/) and Riverside ska-punk band Voodoo Glow Skulls, is in a particularly difficult situation as two of his three bands have been forced to postpone tours. For example, Death By Stereo was scheduled as support for punk rock band Strung Out, which was set to kick off its 30th-anniversary tour in Canada. However, all dates have been postponed indefinitely due to coronavirus concerns.

“I’m hoping we can do something like get together with Strung Out and just stream an incredible show,” said Schulz.

[Orange County rock band Lit](https://www.ocregister.com/2019/08/23/fullerton-rock-band-lit-closes-out-oc-parks-summer-concert-series-and-talks-the-20th-anniversary-of-a-place-in-the-sun/) also had to postpone shows and guitarist Jeremy Popoff suggested a company like [Live Nation](https://www.ocregister.com/2020/03/12/report-livenation-cancels-all-u-s-and-international-tours-over-coronavirus-outbreak/) or AEG/Goldenvoice, who have suspended all tours and postponed festivals for the time being, get some bands together and stream a big rock concert.

“It would be like back in the day when someone on the block would order a Pay-Per-View concert and neighbors would come over and bring food and beer and you’d watch the concert,” he said.

All of the artists agree that during this time the best way for fans to support their favorite acts is to download or buy their music, order some merchandise online or simply tune in to what they’re doing during these quarantined times.

“People are confused, they’re scared and they’re hesitant of everything right now,” Yungblud said. “I think the best thing is not to cancel (stuff), but to postpone it until we figure this all out because the scariest thing is the unknown. But it’s going to be all right, man; I genuinely believe that. To be honest, maybe it’s time to think. We don’t think anymore as a race, we just do. Maybe, just maybe it’s time for us to think about ourselves, our lives, see what’s really happening and focus on what’s important.

“I’ll be writing tunes, playing Monopoly and thinking of mad concepts so I can keep connecting with people and my fans,” he continued. “I’m like a shark, if I stop moving I die.

And I really can’t exist without that world. I’m not about to give up on people or have them give up on me.”
