# Companies get aggressive on return-to-office

The push to get employees [into the office](https://www.axios.com/2022/06/05/work-from-home-elon-musk-remote-office-meetings) on a hybrid schedule is getting more aggressive.

**Why it matters:** As [the labor market](https://www.axios.com/2023/06/02/may-jobs-report-employment) softens, especially in tech, employers are pushing harder on in-person attendance.

**The big picture:**Tech companies were once outspoken [remote work](https://www.axios.com/2023/03/29/remote-work-grew-less-popular-last-year) boosters. That changed after [layoffs rocked the industry](https://www.axios.com/2023/01/06/layoffs-techs-new-normal-amazon-salesforce) — swinging the balance of power in favor of management.

*   There's less fear of upsetting employees, and as more companies announce official [hybrid schedules](https://www.axios.com/2023/06/01/remote-work-trends-2023-yelp), they need ways to enforce the policies.

**What's happening:**In a company-wide email last week, Google chief people officer Fiona Cicconi told staff that office attendance will be considered in their performance reviews, the [WSJ first reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-gets-stricter-about-employees-time-in-office-9a20f2e).

**State of play**: Google, a unit of tech giant Alphabet, had already asked employees to come in three days a week back in April. Many ignored the request, according to the [Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/08/google-salesforce-return-to-office/).

*   Now, Google will send reminders to workers with frequent long-term absences.
*   The company isn't micromanaging daily attendance, a spokesman told Axios, but is looking for folks who are missing from the office for weeks or months at a time, so managers can have a conversation about impact on performance.

**Zoom in:** The law firm [Davis Polk](https://abovethelaw.com/2023/03/davis-polk-associates-bonus-office-attendance/) and banking giant [JPMorgan](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/jpmorgan-managing-directors-asked-work-office-five-days-week-memo-2023-04-12/) also consider in-office attendance as a component of performance reviews.

*   Facebook parent company Meta ordered workers already assigned to an office to return for three days a week, the [Journal reported](https://www.wsj.com/articles/meta-requires-office-workers-to-return-to-desks-three-days-a-week-646a3cb7).
*   Ridesharing company Lyft has also started requiring employees to go in more often. "Things just move faster when you're face to face," CEO David Risher [told the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/business/lyft-return-to-office.html) in April.
*   Not all employers are using sticks to force workers in line. Salesforce is [dangling a carrot](https://fortune.com/2023/06/06/salesforce-return-to-office-charity-incentive/) — telling workers it will donate $10 to a local charity for each day they come to work from June 12 to June 23.

**Yes, but:** The push by tech companies to get employees into offices has been driven by Silicon Valley giants. Smaller tech firms have been more likely to [stick with remote work policies](https://www.axios.com/2023/06/01/remote-work-trends-2023-yelp).

**What to watch:**How workers react. Recall, hundreds of Amazon employees [walked out](https://www.axios.com/2023/06/01/amazon-workers-protest-climate) of the job over return-to-office mandates last month.

*   And Google's union pushed back on the policy quickly after the email went out:
*   "Overnight, workers' professionalism has been disregarded in favor of ambiguous attendance tracking practices tied to our performance evaluations," Chris Schmidt, a software engineer, and union member wrote in a [statement](https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1666839673690546176). "We deserve a voice in shaping the policies that impact our lives."
