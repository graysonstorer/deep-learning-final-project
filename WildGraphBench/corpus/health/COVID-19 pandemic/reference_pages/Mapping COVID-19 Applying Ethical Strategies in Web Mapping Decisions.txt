In December 2019, the world was introduced to a coronavirus, the likes of which have never been seen before, resulting in 

the COVID-19 pandemic. During the initial months of the pandemic, academics, government agencies, and concerned 

citizens, among others, raced to generate maps to help explain the geographic spread of the virus over space and time. 

Maps, however, can be intentionally or unintentionally misleading; we saw this play out during the pandemic as we 

rushed to make COVID-19 dashboards and online maps. While the Johns Hopkins University’s COVID-19 dashboard 

served as the first authoritative resource on the pandemic, it lacked the spatial granularity required for smaller states, 

such as Connecticut. Realizing this limitation, a team of geography Ph.D. students and faculty came together to develop 

a dashboard better suited to serve the residents of the state and aid policymakers during a time when each decision could 

have vast consequences. This case study reflects on our team’s strategies to address the ethical considerations to deliver 

high-quality maps and to promote healthy skepticism among users of the COVID-19 dashboard. We first provide a 

historical background of the discussion around ethics in cartography that we used to frame our arguments and strategies. 

Second, we summarize our deliverables, starting with an online interactive dashboard for 169 towns suitable for both 

mobile and desktop viewing. For the visualizations, we tried to balance the right amount of health information so that 

they were cartographically sound, easy to understand, and not misleading. As geographers, this is one of our responsibili -

ties to our communities.

Wake up, go downstairs to make coffee, boot 

up the work computer, open ArcGIS Pro, and start a 

geoprocessing function that will take a few minutes to 

run. While ArcGIS Pro runs, go online to look at so -

cial media for a few minutes while finishing your coffee. 

During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, 

this routine became the new normal for many geograph -

ic information system (GIS) professionals, and that is 

where this case study in cartographic ethics begins. With 

algorithm-curated social media feeds and the widespread 

proliferation of open-source GIS software, COVID-19 

web-based maps inevitably ended up in the social media 

feeds of cartographic professionals. To the chagrin of 

many, several of these maps did not follow even the most 

basic cartographic conventions based on decades of re -

search, such as normalizing choropleth maps, use of ap -

propriate enumeration units, and appropriate use of color 

(Adams et al. 2023).

Tremendous amounts of work have been done to properly 

implement GIS principles, including establishing consis -

tent data standards, best practices for visualizations, the 

role of web maps in communication, and how to imple -

ment the technology (Jenks 1953; Peng and Tsou 2003; 

Zhang and Li 2005; DeMers 2009; Fu and Sun 2011; 

Zhang et al. 2015; Brewer 2016; Kuria et al. 2019). Today, 

in spite of this body of literature, anyone with a computer, 

access to the Internet, and publicly-available data can cre -

ate a web-based map without properly adhering to the best 

practices of mapmaking. Since such maps can be distrib -

uted widely using social media, expanding the utility of 

GIS to more people (Plewe 1997; 2007; Trainor 2023) has 

created scenarios where maps can be misinterpreted or can 

spread misinformation. 

Without any way to enforce the best practices established 

over decades of research, users are under no obligation 

to read instructions or follow tutorials (Peterson 2008). 

Thus, unfortunately, the best thought-out cartograph -

ic practices and theories often do not leave academia and 

are not implemented by GIS users. While holding all 

GIS users to professional standards is impossible, and 

we can forgive middle-school book reports and personal 

social media pages for cartographic errors, mapmaking 

and GIS lack occupational licensure in the United States, 

resulting in poorly made maps being published and dis -

tributed by federal and state governments (Adams et al. 

2020; Monmonier 1985a). Poorly made maps can mislead 

the public, which is unethical, and they can lead to seri -

ous negative consequences when used to inform decisions 

related to public health crises, like the COVID-19 pan -

demic. The democratization of cartography, i.e., making 

maps easily available, while tremendously advantageous, 

has opened Pandora’s box for an infodemic, spread by the 

share button through screens and smartphones. Academia 

and professionally trained cartographers were well aware 

of these plausible problems with cartography long before 

the COVID-19 pandemic (Harrison 1950; Jenks 1981; 

Monmonier 1985b; 2018; Clarke 1995; Monmonier 

1985a; Jenks 1953). 

In his 1991 paper titled “Ethics and Map Design: Six 

Strategies for Confronting the Traditional One-Map 

Solution,” Mark Monmonier calls for “a conscious effort 

by map authors and cartographic educators to promote 

informed skepticism among map viewers.” Physicists or 

statisticians, for example, exercise their disciplinary re -

sponsibility by informing the general population about 

the wrong applications of laws or statistical functions to 

minimize misinformation and potential harm to society. 

Cartographers and GIS users should not only promote 

ethics and best practices of mapmaking, but also critical -

ly review maps that did not follow any standards. Every 

time a poorly made map comes across our feed on social 

media, it is an opportunity to promote informed skepti -

cism among map viewers, and it is our ethical responsi -

bility as mapmakers to do so even though this may seem 

an exercise in futility. A well-thought-out comment is 

unlikely to gain the same attention as the map itself, and 

often, well-meaning criticisms are overwhelmed by others 

defending the original map. After attempting this a few 

times, one can start to feel that it is easier to keep scroll -

ing. But then the problem persists. During the early stages 

of the COVID-19 pandemic, we witnessed a proliferation 

of web-based maps depicting many different aspects of the 

spread of the pandemic. In spite of cartographic educa -

tors promoting informed skepticism among map viewers, 

the usage of poorly made web-based maps and their dis -

semination via social media led to spread of misinforma -

tion on a novel virus. Some have argued that there was 

a corresponding infodemic, partially spread by bad maps 

(Mooney and Juhász 2020). Research has demonstrated 

that these maps influenced the public’s perception of the 

pandemic, specifically causing rural individuals to falsely 

believe COVID-19 was mostly an urban problem (Engel 

et al. 2022). Misinformation leading individuals to under -

estimate their personal or community risk can have rami -

fications, and research suggests it may have contributed to 

political polarization on these issues (Engel et al. 2022). 

The Johns Hopkins University dashboard served as the 

first authoritative online, continuously updated, map-

based tool on the COVID-19 pandemic, but because it 

displayed county-level data for the US, it lacked the spa -

tial granularity required for smaller US states, such as 

Connecticut (Dong et al. 2020; Everts 2020; Mooney 

and Juhász 2020). With only eight counties in a state of 

about 3.5 million people (Census 2020), any information 

represented at the county-level scale was not helpful when 

community-based organizations (CBOs) and administra -

tive services made day-to-day decisions for their towns. 

Realizing this need, frustrated with rampant poor and 

unhelpful maps online, and attempting to fulfill our dis -

ciplinary and ethical duty to set an example and promote 

map literacy and skepticism, we created the University 

of Connecticut  Department of Geography’s COVID-

19 Mapping Project for Connecticut  for the state’s 169 Cartographic Perspectives,  Number 105, 2025  Mapping COVID-19  – Adams et al. | 69 

towns. Using towns, rather than counties like many other 

states, was particularly important in hindsight, as the state 

of Connecticut has now completely replaced counties with 

nine planning regions that do not correspond to the previ -

ous counties. 

The project focused on creating various visualization ap -

proaches to explore and communicate COVID-19 data 

published in Connecticut. Among the outcomes of this 

project, our team members published papers calling atten -

tion to, and documenting, cartographic issues in official 

United States federal and state COVID-19 dashboards, 

such as the lack of proper normalization in choropleths 

(Adams et al. 2020; Adams et al. 2023). Other papers 

we published made use of the Connecticut COVID-19 

datasets to model the disease using town-level data and 

assess the deployment of vaccines in the state among vul -

nerable populations (Chen et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2021). 

Collectively, we presented our work at local, regional, 

national, and international conferences, including the 

UConn Center for mHealth and Social Media conference 

focusing on COVID-19: Media, Misinformation, and 

Science Communication. We included discussion of our 

work in class material in our department, and we brought 

our work to the attention of medical professionals in pre -

sentations at Connecticut Children’s Hospital. Several 

GIS professionals across the country took similar, or far 

greater, action to try and bring attention to the bad maps 

that appeared during the pandemic and set examples of 

how the maps should look, fulfilling the ethical responsi -

bility of cartographers proposed by individuals like Mark 

Monmonier (1991) and Jeremey Crampton (1995).

This case study reflects on the work of our 

team to address our responsibility to deliver high-quality 

maps and information that would promote healthy skep -

ticism among the users of the COVID-19 dashboard in 

Connecticut. Often, cartographic theory is not incorporat -

ed into practice by GIS users, so to avoid making ethical 

blunders, we tried to justify every cartographic decision we 

made with a citation. We were guided by the six strategies 

from Monmonier’s 1991 paper, “Ethics and Map Design: 

Six Strategies for Confronting the Traditional One-Map 

Solution, ” and below we use them to describe select -

ed ethical quandaries or dilemmas and our responses or 

workarounds. Monmonier’s six strategies are: (1) dynam -

ic sequencing of different cartographic views, (2) creating 

experiential maps, (3) abiding by professional standards, 

with a Code of Cartographic Ethics calling for present -

ing alternative views, (4) disclosing experiments, (5) pro -

moting informed skepticism among map viewers, and (6) 

institutional structures (Monmonier 1991). During our 

project, these strategies served as a framework to help 

guide our decisions, workflows, and goals, while giving us 

a broader justification for what we were doing, including 

the use of an interactive dashboard over more traditional 

static cartography. These strategies served to help us avoid 

contributing to the spread of misinformation. 

We addressed Monmonier’s strategies #1 and #3  by im -

plementing what Monmonier called “atlas touring” using 

a variety of spatial visualizations, graphs, and charts that 

we adapted throughout the pandemic (Monmonier 1991). 

These were divided into two products: an online COVID-

19 dashboard and a policy-based visualization. Using an 

Esri dashboard app, with the Johns Hopkins dashboard as 

inspiration, we created a dashboard that was updated daily 

for the state of Connecticut. Throughout the pandemic, 

the topics of the web maps and visualizations hosted on 

our dashboard varied. We created and published chorop -

leth maps, proportional symbol maps, dot density maps, 

pie chart maps, line graphs, bar charts, and raw number 

values. Many of the maps had dynamic scales (that is, they 

were zoomable) and pop-ups, allowing users to engage with 

the maps and see the raw data for themselves. Notably, we 

provided a town-level map of case rate (per 10,000 people) 

over the previous two weeks based on the (known) incuba -

tion period of the COVID-19 infection, which was unique 

and was not provided by any other COVID-19 tracking 

systems in the state. Later, when vaccination efforts were 

underway, we created a map (Figure 1) that showed the 

percentage of the population fully vaccinated by town and 

placed a star symbol on the centroid of towns that had 

reached 70% coverage for “herd immunity,” based on the 

best information at the time (Plans-Rubió 2022). This was 

later replaced with an interactive web slider (Figure 2) em -

bedded in the main dashboard that facilitated comparison 

of full vaccination and first dose percentages by town. To 

incorporate the time variable, we used two different ani -

mations: a dot density map showing total cases, and a pie 

chart depicting vaccination status by town. Later, we used Cartographic Perspectives,  Number 105, 2025  Mapping COVID-19  – Adams et al. | 70 

Figure 1.  Percent of population fully vaccinated.

a swipe tool to compare variables related to COVID-19 

vaccination side by side on the map. 

Realizing the importance and the potential impact of the 

executive orders of Governor Ned Lamont, and other 

landmark intervention and mitigation efforts at the na -

tional level, such as the CDC’s mask usage guidelines and 

the vaccine rollout, we developed our second product using 

open-source resources like Shiny in R and JavaScript. 

This was an interactive  website , “Visualizing Associations 

between Policy Decision Timeline and COV ID-19 

Infection for Connecticut” (Figure 3). The timeline on the 

website showed the subsequent major COVID-19 related 

executive orders and mitigation measures, re-openings of 

schools, restaurants, and vaccination roll-out undertaken 

by the state of Connecticut after the first case appeared 

on March 6th, 2020, and the first executive order of “state 

emergency” was declared on March 10th, 2020. 

Over time we adapted our dashboard items with “expe -

riential maps,” per Monmonier’s strategy #2, to meet the 

changing conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic and its 

mitigation efforts. Early on in the pandemic, when testing 

was the number one priority, we made sure to include the 

location and associated information related to testing sites 

in Connecticut. When it was time to make decisions about 

returning to school in the fall of 2020, we incorporated 

the location of all state universities in Connecticut so that 

users could readily understand the COVID-19 conditions 

in the university towns. When the vaccine rollout started 

in February 2021, we added a pie chart showing weekly 

trends in the percentage of unvaccinated, first-dose, and 

fully-vaccinated people by town. In Figure 3, the time -

line depicting the governor’s executive orders and policies 

is interactive and allows users to click on various orders/ 

policies to see what the situation was like on the date it 

was implemented. From a historical perspective, we hope 

that this can give insight to the impact of health policies/ 

mitigation measures on the spread and transmission of 

COVID-19 cases. This could be useful for future infec -

tious diseases outbreaks. 

Our team attempted to proactively implement Mon -

monier’s strategy #3, providing alternate views, during 

weekly discussions over Zoom, during which we discussed 

each visualization, proposed possible additional ones, and 

tried to be as careful as possible in our cartographic deci -

sion making. We also discussed issues related to COVID-

19 health disparities, the lack of data by race/ethnicity 

and gender, and the incident of an  alleged whistleblow -

er  who was a geographer and a GIS analyst at Florida’s 

Department of Public Health regarding data aggregation 

and curation. These experiences and interactions, and 

our teamwork, led to the overall growth and maturity of 

the “cartographers” in us while we lived through a public 

health crisis.

We tried to implement Monmonier’s strategy #4, “dis -

closing experiments,” in several ways. We documented 

our data processing decisions, and we have included a 

discussion of our mapmaking decisions in the methodol -

ogy section of forthcoming papers. One example of the 

need to document data curation arose when the state of 

Connecticut shifted from publishing daily case counts for 

weekends, to publishing Saturday and Sunday added onto 

Monday’s numbers. To continue logging daily counts and 

remedy this problem, we divided the Monday case count 

by three, and equally attributed it to Saturday, Sunday, 

and Monday. While this was not ideal, because we were 

forced to assume without evidence that the number of 

COVID-19 cases was same on all the three days, it was 

the only way to maintain daily case counts for analysis. To 

our surprise, another department at UConn noticed that 

Saturday, Sunday, and Monday were always equal, and 

contacted us with their concerns. This decision was docu -

mented, so that we could share these limitations with our 

users. 

As another example, daily case counts for a town could be 

negative values because officials would periodically adjust 

the number of previously recorded cases, thus lowering 

the town’s case count. In these instances, we resorted to 

changing the negative values to zeros for the daily visual -

izations to mitigate the confusion associated with a daily 

negative case count. However, these adjustments resulted 

in massive outliers in some instances, which we needed 

to either exclude from our analysis, or adjust for. These 

changes had to be documented very carefully to avoid mis -

understandings or accusations that we were manipulating 

the data to suit a particular narrative. In hindsight, one 

strategy to maintain full disclosure would have been to 

capture a screenshot of the web map at regular intervals 

and include it in the documentation. Because web maps 

can be changed by the organization maintaining them— 

removing yesterday’s mistakes and patterns that may have 

inf luenced policy being implemented today—and are 

also subject to link rot, this type of documentation could 

have captured the changes we made and provided more 

transparency. 

We tried to implement Monmonier’s strategy #5, “promot -

ing informed skepticism among map viewers,” in multiple 

ways. First, we published papers discussing problems with 

the official government dashboards, explicitly focusing 

on the normalization of choropleth maps and the colors 

and enumeration units used to make them. We present -

ed papers and posters on these subjects at several academ -

ic conferences, workshops at the Connecticut Children’s 

Hospital, and courses at University of Connecticut. 

Among these presentations was a YouTube video poster 

prepared for the “ COVID-19: Media, Misinformation, 

and Science Communication ” conference organized by the 

UConn Center for mHealth and Social Media. Many of 

these activities can also be seen as satisfying Monmonier’s 

strategy #6, which calls for using “public forums, a journal 

of cartographic criticism, or courses promoting systematic 

critiques of maps, especially potentially persuasive maps” 

to get feedback on map design (Monmonier 1991). During 

the project, we reviewed other dashboards and web map -

ping projects, and we presented issues we found with 

those maps at conferences and as a write-up in the  Journal 

of Maps  (Adams et al. 2023). Members of our the proj -

ect group were interviewed by NBC Connecticut, during 

which they discussed the potential for web maps on our 

dashboard to facilitate understanding of the COVID-19 

case data (Jones 2020). 

Figure 4 shows data and different frames from our dash -

board to support our narrative of why and how we used 

Monmonier’s strategies to help us avoid contributing to 

the spread of misinformation. This figure demonstrates the 

impact of symbolization (choropleth vs dot density), nor -

malization (rate vs total cases), and the modifiable areal 

unit problem (MAUP) based on scales of geography 

(towns, counties, and planning regions) on the way spatial 

patterns appear on a map (Openshaw 1977; Fotheringham 

1989). 

# D I S C U S S I O N ( A N D A C A L L T O A C T I O N ) 

The activities of the members of the COVID-

19 Mapping Project for Connecticut, which is detailed in 

this case study, are just a tiny snapshot of the work carried 

out by geographers and cartographers across the country. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, in spite of spread of in -

formation via poorly designed maps, the larger GIS com -

munity tried to demonstrate our technology’s capabilities 

to study and map a pandemic in near real time to inform Cartographic Perspectives,  Number 105, 2025  Mapping COVID-19  – Adams et al. | 73 

policy (Dong et al. 2020; Delmelle et al. 2024). However, 

at the federal and state government levels, there were 

major failures to adhere to the most basic of cartograph -

ic standards, including failure to use appropriate symbol -

ization or enumeration units (Adams et al. 2020; Adams 

et al. 2023). These failures can erode the trust that peo -

ple place in maps, which can potentially cost lives when 

those maps are needed to coordinate the response to di -

sasters. Ultimately, all society can do now is evaluate how 

GIS was used during the COVID-19 pandemic, assess the 

strengths and failures of those uses, and try to take an ac -

tive role in ethically implementing the technology in the 

future. Moving forward, if nothing else, we can use the 

examples of misinformation spread by official government 

COVID-19 maps to underscore the importance of carto -

graphic conventions. 

Crampton (1998) calls for GIS professionals to be “Internet 

activists” in spreading good content online, and set the 

tone in regard to employing GIS and cartography online 

(Crampton 1998; McGranaghan 1999). Perhaps those of 

Mark Monmonier’s “cartographic priesthood” must take 

this activism a step further and implement his strategies 

for ethics in map design by engaging with the comment 

section on social media as cartographic critics, insist on 

adherence to cartographic standards wherever possible, 

and patiently try to spread cartographic literacy and map 

skepticism to educate the public. We must also ensure that 

we do not contribute to the infodemic through poor carto -

graphic decisions, which can only be achieved by working 

ethical strategies into our workflows from the beginning 

of a project.
