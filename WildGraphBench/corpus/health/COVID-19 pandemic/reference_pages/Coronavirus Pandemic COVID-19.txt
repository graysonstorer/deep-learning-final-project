COVID-19 Pandemic

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world. Explore global data and research to understand its impact, spread, and global response.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the world, causing [tens of millions of deaths](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/excess-deaths-cumulative-economist-single-entity), overwhelming healthcare systems, and disrupting societies and economies.

The rapid spread of the coronavirus led to many scientific developments and policies — from rapid [testing](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-testing) and [vaccines](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) to [social distancing](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/countries-with-restrictions-on-public-gatherings) and financial support — but an uneven global response, with significant disparities in healthcare access, economic responses, and outcomes.

[Reliable data](https://ourworldindata.org/key-lessons-from-our-work-on-the-covid-19-pandemic-are-now-published-in-lancet-public-health) has been crucial to effectively track and respond to the pandemic and guide public health efforts, research, and policies.

For several years during the pandemic, our team at Our World in Data published daily updates on a range of crucial indicators and developed two global datasets on [testing](https://ourworldindata.org/our-world-in-data-covid-19-testing-dataset-published-by-nature) and [vaccination](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations-nature). Our COVID-19 Data Explorer became a go-to source for people to understand the extent and spread of the disease.

On this page, you will find our wide-ranging catalog of data and research on the COVID-19 pandemic.
