How South America became a coronavirus epicenter
================================================

South America has become “[a new epicenter](https://www.businessinsider.com/south-america-has-become-new-covid-19-epicenter-who-says-2020-5)” of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) — and it looks like the situation there is going to get worse before it gets any better.

The region officially has more than [636,000 confirmed cases and more than 31,000 deaths](https://ais.paho.org/phip/viz/COVID19Table.asp) as of May 25. But due to a [dearth of testing and medical facilities](https://www.vox.com/2020/4/22/21229404/coronavirus-south-america-cases-deaths-brazil), experts believe the outbreak is far bigger than the official numbers show.

[Brazil](https://www.vox.com/2020/4/28/21228512/brazil-bolsonaro-coronavirus-moro), the continent’s largest and most populous country, also has the largest outbreak, with more than [363,000 confirmed cases](https://ais.paho.org/phip/viz/COVID19Table.asp) — and President [Jair Bolsonaro](https://www.vox.com/2020/5/21/21264956/brazil-coronavirus-bolsonaro-chloroquine) is still refusing to impose aggressive measures to curb the spread.

In [Peru](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/25/americas/peru-covid-hotspot-why-intl/index.html), the area’s second-most affected country, many of the nation’s poorest residents are forced to violate government-imposed quarantine measures and curfews in order to buy food for the day or access government stimulus benefits.

And in [Chile](https://www.vox.com/2020/5/20/21263919/anti-lockdown-protests-coronavirus-germany-brazil-uk-chile), the government’s inability to provide enough food for its citizens during the pandemic has led thousands to take to the streets of the capital, Santiago, to protest the lockdown, creating a perfect breeding ground for the virus to spread. President Sebastián Piñera [said](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-52793940) Sunday that the outbreak has brought the country’s health care system “very close to the limit” of breaking.

Even more concerning, experts say these conditions are unlikely to improve anytime soon.

Some countries in South America have deficient health care systems that struggled to cope with infectious diseases endemic to the region even before the coronavirus hit.
