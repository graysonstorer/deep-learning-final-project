Is the covid pandemic over? The World Health Organization (WHO) is set to consider that question at a meeting this week, its 14th since the UN agency first identified the coronavirus outbreak in January 2020.

On Friday (Jan. 27), the WHO’s International Health Regulations (2005) Emergency Committee will discuss whether the covid outbreak still meets the definition of a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), the agency’s highest risk level. While the call is ultimately one for WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus to make, he has so far consistently followed the committee’s advice throughout the pandemic.

“While I will not preempt the advice of the emergency committee, I remain very concerned by the situation in many countries and the rising number of deaths,” [Tedros said](https://www.who.int/multi-media/details/who-press-conference-on-global-health-issues---24-january-2023) at a press conference ahead of the meeting, the first to take place since China [lifted its zero-covid policy](https://qz.com/china-ending-zero-covid-is-hurting-economic-confidence-1849909469). The WHO chief specifically referred to the recent surge in covid cases in China, where at least 170,000 deaths have been reported in the last eight weeks.

The committee will consider the [specific parameters of a PHEIC](https://www.who.int/health-topics/international-health-regulations#tab=tab_1), namely whether the outbreak is still “serious, sudden, unusual, or unexpected.” While the pandemic clearly remains serious, the past three years have seen significant improvement in protecting people against the virus, through rapid antigen tests, treatments like the [Paxlovid antiviral pill](https://www.massgeneralbrigham.org/en/about/newsroom/press-releases/paxlovid-effective-in-reducing-covid-19-hospitalization#:~:text=BOSTON%20%E2%80%93%20The%20antiviral%20drug%20nirmatrelvir,unvaccinated%20individuals%20with%20COVID%2D19.), and vaccines. More than [two thirds of the world population](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations) have so far received at least one dose of a covid vaccine. The committee is expected to announce its decision on Jan. 30.
