The EU has offered “a heartfelt apology” to Italy for letting it down at the start of the coronavirus crisis as fresh evidence emerged that few European countries are likely to have achieved herd immunity as they begin cautiously lifting their lockdowns.

As the [World Health Organization](https://www.theguardian.com/world/world-health-organization) warned that the continent remained firmly “in the eye of the storm”, the president of the European commission said on Thursday that truth was needed to overcome the Covid-19 pandemic – including political honesty.

“Too many were not there on time when [Italy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/italy) needed a helping hand at the very beginning,” Ursula von der Leyen told the European parliament. “And yes, for that it is right that Europe as a whole offers a heartfelt apology.”

Early in the crisis, both France and Germany imposed export bans on vital medical equipment, while no EU country initially responded to Italy’s call for aid via the bloc’s emergency mechanism. While healthcare policy and provision is the responsibility of member states, the EU is meant to support cooperation between them.

How coronavirus changed the world in three months – video

An opinion poll [last month](https://www.ecfr.eu/article/commentary_whatever_it_takes_italy_and_covid_19_crisis) found that 88% of Italians felt the EU was failing to support their country, prompting fears in Brussels and other national capitals of a Eurosceptic backlash. Von der Leyen’s direct apology went further than a previous statement in which she she chided member states for their “only-for-me response”.

As more European governments begin easing physical distancing restrictions, a Dutch study suggested only a tiny percentage of people may have developed antibodies against Covid-19, reinforcing concerns about a “second wave” of infections when populations embark on a gradual return to normal life.

Jaap van Dissel of the National Institute for Public [Health](https://www.theguardian.com/society/health) (RIVM) said the study of more than 7,000 Dutch blood donors found just 3% had developed antibodies against the virus. The figure suggested only “several hundred thousand people” were likely to have contracted Covid-19 in a country of 17 million, he said.

The study followed a similar survey of 1,500 people in Austria who were not in hospital during early April. That found that less than 1% of the population was “acutely infected” with the virus.

The WHO’s regional director for Europe, Hans Kluge, cautioned on Thursday that despite “optimistic signs” in some of the countries worst hit by the virus, such as Italy and Spain, the number of global cases was still rising – and half were in Europe.

While new infections were broadly declining in Spain, Italy, Germany, France and Switzerland, sustained or increasing levels were still being recorded in Britain, Turkey, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, Kluge said, urging countries that had started easing restrictions to make sure control mechanisms were in place.

“It is imperative we do not let down our guard,” Kluge said. Countries should ensure transmission was under control before they began lifting lockdowns, and that their healthcare systems had the capacity “to identify, isolate, test, trace and quarantine”.

Workplaces needed to take preventative measures, and countries needed to effectively manage the risks of importing new cases from abroad, he added. If governments cannot meet all these criteria, Kluge said, they should “please rethink”.

Denmark on Wednesday became the first country in Europe to start reopening its schools, while [Austria, Italy and Spain](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/14/eu-countries-coronavirus-lockdown-italy-spain) have allowed certain businesses to reopen and some non-essential workers to go back to their jobs.

Germany has [announced initial steps](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/15/angela-merkel-announces-plans-reopen-schools-shops-germany-coronavirus-lockdown) to reopen some shops and gradually restart schools from 4 May, while French pupils will begin returning to school from 11 May. Finland has lifted a travel blockade on the Helsinki region.

Typical of countries further advanced along the pandemic curve, Spain, which has recorded 19,130 deaths, on Thursday announced 5,183 new cases – a rise of 2.9% over the previous 24 hours, well down from the daily average of 12% at the end of March and 20% in mid-March.

Von der Leyen said of letting Italy down at the beginning of the pandemic: “Yes, it is true that no one was really ready for this,” she told the European parliament.

“It is also true that too many were not there on time when Italy needed a helping hand at the very beginning. And yes, for that, it is right that Europe as a whole offers a heartfelt apology.” More than 21,000 people have died from the virus in Italy, the highest death toll in Europe.

According to the [Johns Hopkins University tracker](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html), nearly 2.1 million people have been infected by coronavirus and nearly 140,000 have died, including 90,000 in Europe. Nearly 60% of the world’s population is living under some kind of mandatory or voluntary confinement.

In the US, which has recorded [the most deaths](https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state) of any country, with 30,985 fatalities out of 639,644 reported infections, Donald Trump was due on Thursday to announce guidelines on reopening parts of the country, [insisting](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/16/trump-wades-further-into-china-covid-19-row-as-focus-turns-to-easing-lockdowns) that his “aggressive strategy” against the virus was working and that “the data suggests that nationwide we have passed the peak on new cases”.

As the head of the United Nations, António Guterres, said only a “safe and effective vaccine” could return the world to normal, adding that he hoped one might be available by the end of the year, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation offered $150m (£120m) for vaccine development.

The foundation’s chief executive, Mark Suzman, said the challenge was huge. “There are 7 billion people on the planet,” he said. “We are going to need to vaccinate nearly every one. There is no manufacturing capacity to do that.”

Concern continues to mount over the advance of the pandemic in Africa, where the African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday that more than 1m tests would [begin to be rolled out](https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-live-news-cases-worldwide-top-2-million-trump-doubts-china-death-toll) from next week to address a huge shortfall in assessing the true number of cases on the continent.

At this unsettling time
-----------------------

We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could spare 37 seconds to support our most important fundraising appeal of the year.

In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year on from his second victory, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one.

From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced.

While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts.

While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel.

**Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less.**

**But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, it means we’ll show you fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you.**
