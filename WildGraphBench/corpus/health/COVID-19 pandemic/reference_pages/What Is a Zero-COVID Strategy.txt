# What Is a Zero-COVID Strategy

1www.isglobal.org 

The strategy of control and maxi-mum suppression 1 (zero-COVID 2,3 )has been implemented successfully in a number of countries (see Figure 1) . The objective of this strategy is to keep trans-mission of the virus as close to zero as possible and ultimately to eliminate it entirely from particular geographical areas . The strategy aims to increase the capacity to identify and trace chains of transmission and to identify and manage outbreaks, while also integrating eco-nomic, psychological, social and health-care support to guarantee the isolation of cases and contacts. This approach is also known as “Find, Test, Trace, Isolate and Support” (FTTIS) 4 . The more coordinated, flexible and effective the process, the easier it is to curb the circulation of the virus and keep the number of cases close to zero. Likewise, the lower the incidence of infection, the more effective the strategy is and the eas-ier it becomes to slow the pandemic and mitigate its impacts on health, society and the economy. As a public health strategy, it is impor-tant to distinguish maximum suppres-sion from the strategy of seeking to end the pandemic by gradually allowing the population to become infected. This ap-proach, known as herd immunity 5, can be a lengthy and costly way to control an epidemic , especially for groups at higher risk of severe disease. It also dis-proportionately affects the most econom-

ically and socially vulnerable individuals and communities. From the standpoint of the precautionary principle , a herd immunity approach is inadvisable because we have a limited understanding of the du-ration of immunity, the long-term impact of the disease, the behaviour of the disease in successive reinfections, and the associ-ated rates of morbidity and mortality. The maximum suppression strategy should also be distinguished from con-tainment or mitigation strategies 

aimed at preventing the health system from being overwhelmed (“flattening the curve”) . Even though mitigation strategies are useful when community spread is already very high and impacting the health system, they have an impor-tant weakness: they fail to address pe-riods of low transmission or sporadic cases . A mitigation approach therefore runs a high risk of leading to persistent transmission, necessitating endless cycles of lockdowns followed by a relaxation of restrictions—a pattern that cripples the economy, the health system and com-munity engagement. In contrast, early preventive action to keep transmission under control not only prevents health system overload at every level of care— including care for diseases other than COVID-19—but also protects the phys-ical and emotional health of citizens and health professionals, while also preserv-ing social and economic life and increas-ing the trust and commitment of society as a whole .

Figure 1. Examples of How Strategies Vary by Country. 

• South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Vietnam and New Zealand have prioritised the containment and elimination of the novel coronavirus. Countries that previously experienced the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) or severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) viruses have emphasised the importance of reducing the number of cases to zero. • Other countries , viewing viral spread as inevitable, have sought to either mitigate the most acute and severe health impacts or allow controlled spread until some degree of herd immunity is achieved. 3www.isglobal.org 

The way in which a fact is presented and framed determines the actions taken in re-sponse to it and the parties called upon to act. 6. Therefore, it is essential that we pay attention to the metaphors and narra-tives that help us make sense of the pan-demic. Management of COVID-19 has thus far been characterised by objectives, indicators and expert knowledge, all la-ser-focused on mitigating or containing the health emergency. However, as the concept of a 

syndemic 7 reminds us, fo-cusing excessively on the more clini-cal and biological features of a disease can cause us to overlook other aspects 

such as social factors—particularly socio-economic inequality—that are fundamen-tal to understanding the pandemic and improving our management of it. Similarly, treating the pandemic as a

health emergency can situate us in a response framework that is too immedi-ate and neglects the slower, more gradu-al effects, damage and impacts that arise from tolerating persistently high incidence rates. Examples include the increase in isolation and social inequality, the de-crease in first oncology appointments and the “long COVID” syndromes found in some patients 8. The concept of slow dis-aster might be useful here. Scientifically, this term refers to an atypical type of dam-age: more gradual, prolonged and silent than our traditional image of a disaster 9.This concept can help us become better at recognising risk and understand certain logics and impacts of infection that are not readily visible or tangible. Concepts like syndemic and slow disaster 

are examples of alternative frameworks 

that can help us understand the pandemic and prevent infection. They can also help us adjust our strategy, temporal framework and expectations to a long, complex cri-sis that, according to some models, could last two to five years 10 .

A well-sized, robust and coordinated public health infrastructure is crucial to implementing a FTTIS strategy capa-ble of achieving the goal of controlling and suppressing transmission of the virus. It is essential that epidemiological sur-veillance services have good leadership and the capacity to deliver an adequate response in coordination with health promotion and protection services. In terms of size, tools and coordination, the infrastructure must be capable of guar-anteeing that the FTTIS strategy can be implemented quickly, thoroughly and with the necessary support .

1. Speed is the key to detecting cases and contacts, prescribing isolation and quar-antine, and supporting people who need to isolate or quarantine themselves in or-der to interrupt chains of transmission. Speed is also a key factor in monitoring, evaluating and building trust in the pub-lic health strategy. 

2. In order to perform thorough contact tracing (finding out where each person was infected and, therefore, where the virus is circulating), an infrastructure composed of IT/technology and human resources must collect information on the places visited by infected individu-als and their contacts in order to group cases, suspected outbreaks and chains of transmission. Besides indicating that the epidemic is under control, thorough con-tact tracing helps the authorities make decisions regarding alert levels and other actions. 

3. To ensure that people adhere to iso-lation and quarantine procedures, it is essential to provide effective, broad and diversified support —financial aid, hous-ing assistance, social and psychological support, access to food and drugs, legal and employment advice, etc. Tools for systematically detecting support needs should be deployed in order to provide an adequate response and coordinate policies, services and personnel to guar-antee good conditions for isolation and quarantine. The infrastructure must be large enough to handle the workload and capable of adapting and scaling quickly as needs dictate. It is essential to have an across-the-board scaling programme for all hu-man resources involved in the FTTIS system—from testing to tracing—in or-der to prevent the system from becoming overloaded. A testing policy should be established to assess and develop proto-cols for the various tests available, there-by optimising their utility. In order to develop this strategy, it is also necessary to encourage teamwork , communication among all parties involved, and a culture of review, continuous evaluation and adaptation to change. Other crucial resources include a cen-tralised information system that allows rapid, systematic and standard-ised data entry 11 or, failing that, a rapid information-sharing circuit to connect care providers and other key players and encourage collaboration between differ-ent jurisdictions. Tools such as a Blue-tooth-based automatic contact detection application can be helpful, although they can never replace a solid public health infrastructure. Systems of this sort have been known to misidentify contacts. Moreover, they require a high level of ac-ceptance. (Singapore, a model of success, has only managed to get 20% of the pop-ulation to use its application.) Equally necessary are internal commu-nication tools to guarantee fluid contact between public health entities and other government bodies involved in the FT-TIS strategy (ministries of health, social welfare, employment, economy, housing, etc.). Additionally, to the extent possi-ble, health care services (primary care, hospitals, etc.) should be relieved of sur-veillance and diagnostic tasks in order to allow the health system to operate nor-

World Health Organisation. 2020 (WHO/2019-nCoV/ Urban_preparedness/2020.1).

The strategy of maximum suppression must be accompanied by an alert-lev-el plan devised with input from all sec-tors of society (see examples from New Zealand and Ireland 12,13,14 ), in order to organise and regulate the vari-ous public health measures that must be implemented at different times during the epidemic. These measures include restrictions and, when necessary, stay-at-home orders (see Figure 2) , which must be accompanied by economic and social support to mitigate their consequences. The overall objective is to restore tracea-bility and control, as well as to suppress transmission of the virus. Each alert level refers to a different set of population-lev-el primary prevention measures, thus en-suring consistency in efforts to control and reduce viral spread. Alert-level plans must be inclusive and sensitive to the rights and needs of cit-izens—especially the most vulnerable groups—and avoid discrimination on the basis of age, disability, gender, culture, socioeconomic status or institutional-isation, among other factors, while also anticipating other risks and emergencies that could interact with the pandemic (cold or heat waves, etc.). Effective implementation requires that the plan be public and widely agreed upon . Knowledge of the different meas-ures envisaged in the plan allows people to think ahead and prepare for alerts, which in turn fosters consistency, trust, credibility and community collaboration. Local institutions also have a fundamen-tal role to play in controlling the pan-demic. Alert-level plans should therefore be accompanied by guidance on best practices for local authorities 15 .

# An Alert-Level Plan “In a maximum suppression strategy, stay-at-home orders are used during phases with a low number of cases. They are implemented briefly, in a targeted manner (only where necessary) and in coordination with other measures.” 3. Figure 2. Stay-at-home Orders As a Control Tool in Different Strategies. 

• Stay-at-home orders have been shown to be effective at reducing transmission, albeit with significant economic and psychosocial consequences. In a maximum suppression strategy , stay-at-home orders are used during phases with a low number of cases to restore traceability and control. They are implemented briefly, in a targeted manner (only where necessary) and in coordination with other measures. • In contrast, in mitigation strategies , stay-at-home orders are implemented later, during phases with very high rates of transmission, with the aim of preventing the health system from becoming overwhelmed. They therefore tend to be longer, more restrictive, and have a greater psychosocial and socioeconomic impact. The subsequent need to rapidly offset these impacts causes transmission rates to increase sharply once restrictions are lifted, thus increasing the likelihood of further stay-at-home orders and a loss of public trust in the effectiveness of the measures. If the authorities take too long to issue a stay-at-home order—and especially if such place and lifted too soon— transmission can become persistent, leading overall to a more severe impact on health, the economy and society. 7www.isglobal.org

Wellcome Open Res. 2020. 5:213. 22 World Health Organisation infographic about the “Three Cs” strategy. Community involvement is essential to the success of a maximum suppression strategy. For this approach to be feasible, it is crucial to devise a communication strategy capable of generating safe spaces, solidarity and trust 17 . In other words, the communication strategy must be capable of framing the zero-COVID objective as a matter of solidarity and constructive action 18,19 , rather than as a question of individual safety (self-protection), obedi-ence (compliance) or moral responsibili-ty (good behaviour). It is also important to communicate truthfully, rigorously, understandably and accessibly about risks. The messaging must be credible, coherent, consistent over time and based on scientific evidence , as well as sensitive to the needs of different groups and social situations. Communications should also be em-powering —that is, they should help people identify risks and make everyday decisions that lead to safer and more sup-portive environments, relationships and communities. For example, it is impor-tant to convey the importance of ventilat-ing indoor spaces, 20 , following the “social bubble” strategy 21 and avoiding crowded places 22 . The messaging should explicit-ly spell out the epidemiological logic 

behind the measures and recommenda-tions. It is also essential to establish chan-nels for listening, dialogue and public debate so that the epidemiological logic can be modulated and adapted to differ-ent groups and social situations. The data and indicators used to pub-licly monitor and assess the crisis 

influence people’s understanding of the conceptual and temporal framework of crisis management. It is therefore impor-tant to prioritise indicators and examples that tell a more coherent and consistent story about risks (e.g. describing out-breaks and percentages of linked cases, rather than hospital occupancy rates) and encourage citizens to do their part to con-trol the spread of the virus .

Finally, when implementing a strategy of minimising transmission, we believe it is crucial to promote interdisciplinary, transdisciplinary and multidiscipli-nary research on the pandemic . Thus far, in keeping with the health-emergency narrative, prioritisation and funding have primarily been directed towards strictly biomedical research, with little attention paid to epidemiological studies, which have essentially consisted of mathemat-ical modelling. There are a number of essential impacts, factors and dynam-ics—psychological 23 , social 24 , economic, political 25 , cultural 26 , etc.—involved in re-ducing and preventing the spread of the virus that have not been widely studied thus far 27 . For example, few studies have investigated what sorts of social, geo-graphical and economic conditions—or what places, groups and situations—en-courage or discourage people from follow-ing public health measures 28 . Similarly, little research has looked into cultures or collective imaginations of risk, how they break down by social groups and how they shape people’s involvement in FT-TIS strategies 29 . Developing a more plu-ral and integrated body of knowledge and research is essential to anticipating, tracing and interrupting chains of trans-mission as quickly as possible. The need for a complex response to an equally complex problem must also be expressed in the arena of public debate. We therefore consider it important to en-courage a broader, more transparent and better informed debate about the pandemic , raising the profile of other important angles, voices and sources of knowledge. This debate should encom-pass not only a broad range of expert knowledge but also the public at large. In-formed by this exchange of ideas, we will be better equipped to adjust and improve the strategy of maximum suppression, making it more effective, comprehensive and widely shared. In short, this pandem-ic could be an opportunity to strengthen the relationship between science, politics and the public .

As the specialised literature shows, so-cieties that learn and collaborate tend to emerge from major crises sooner and stronger 30 . Experiences at the internation-al level suggest that countries pursuing a maximum suppression strategy develop a more effective epidemiological and community response with fewer neg-ative economic 31 and psychosocial consequences than those which adopt a mitigation or herd-immunity strategy. Although the maximum suppression strategy is challenging and demands a high degree of coordination and social involvement over an extended period of time, it is proving its value as a tool for 

overcoming this crisis, preparing for future pandemics and fostering soli-darity worldwide .
