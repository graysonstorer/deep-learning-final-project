How to Protect Yourself and Others
==================================

For Everyone

 Mar. 10, 2025 

[Español](https://espanol.cdc.gov/enes/covid/prevention/)

What to know
------------

*   CDC’s Respiratory Virus Guidance provides strategies you can use to help protect yourself and others from health risks caused by COVID-19 and other respiratory viruses.
*   These actions can help you lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission (spreading or catching COVID-19) and lower the risk of severe illness if you get sick.

[](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html "Core Prevention Strategies")
Core Prevention Strategies
--------------------------

[CDC recommends](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/index.html)that all people use core prevention strategies to protect themselves and others from COVID-19:

*   Stay up to date with [COVID-19 vaccines](https://www.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html).
    *   Although vaccinated people sometimes get infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, staying up to date on COVID-19 vaccines significantly lowers the risk of getting very sick, being hospitalized, or dying from COVID-19.

*   Practice good [hygiene](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/hygiene.html)(practices that improve cleanliness)
*   Take [steps for cleaner air](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/air-quality.html)

When you are sick:

*   Use [precautions to prevent spread](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html), including staying home and away from others (including people you live with who are not sick) if you have respiratory symptoms.
    *   Learn when you can [go back to your normal activities](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html).

*   Seek health care promptly for [testing](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/testing.html)and/or [treatment](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/treatment/index.html)if you have [risk factors for severe illness](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/risk-factors/index.html). Treatment may help lower your risk of severe illness, but it needs to be started within a few days of when your symptoms begin.

### Additional Prevention Strategies

In addition, there are other prevention strategies that you can choose to further protect yourself and others.

*   [Wearing a mask](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/masks.html) and [putting distance between yourself and others](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/physical-distancing.html) can help lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
*   [Testing for COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/covid/testing/index.html) can help you decide what to do next, like getting [treatment](https://www.cdc.gov/covid/treatment/index.html)to reduce your risk of severe illness and [taking steps](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/prevention/precautions-when-sick.html) to lower your chances of spreading COVID-19 to others.

[](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/prevention.html "What to watch out for")
What to watch out for
---------------------

Using these prevention strategies can be especially helpful when:

*   Respiratory viruses, such as COVID-19, flu, and RSV, are causing a lot of [illness in your community](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/index.html)
*   You or those around you have [risk factors](https://www.cdc.gov/respiratory-viruses/risk-factors/index.html) for severe illness
*   You or those around you were recently exposed to a respiratory virus, are sick, or are recovering

### Check Your Community

Find out if respiratory viruses are causing a lot of illness in your community. Data updated weekly.
