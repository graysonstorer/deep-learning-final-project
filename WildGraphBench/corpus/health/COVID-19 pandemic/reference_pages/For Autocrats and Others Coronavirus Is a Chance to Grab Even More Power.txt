Leaders around the world have passed emergency decrees and legislation expanding their reach during the pandemic. Will they ever relinquish them?

LONDON — In Hungary, the prime minister can now rule by decree. In Britain, ministers have what a critic called “eye-watering” power to detain people and close borders. Israel’s prime minister has shut down courts and begun an [intrusive surveillance of citizens](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/world/middleeast/israel-coronavirus-cellphone-tracking.html). Chile has [sent the military to public squares](https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/03/18/world/americas/18reuters-health-coronavirus-chile.html) once occupied by protesters. Bolivia has postponed elections.

As the [coronavirus pandemic brings the world to a juddering halt](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/coronavirus-maps.html) and anxious citizens demand action, leaders across the globe are invoking executive powers and seizing virtually dictatorial authority with scant resistance.

Governments and rights groups agree that these extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures. States need new powers to shut their borders, enforce quarantines and track infected people. Many of these actions are protected under international rules, constitutional lawyers say.

But critics say some governments are using the public health crisis as cover to seize new powers that have little to do with the outbreak, with few safeguards to ensure that their new authority will not be abused.

The laws are taking swift hold across a broad range of political systems — in authoritarian states like Jordan, faltering democracies like Hungary, and traditional democracies like Britain. And there are few sunset provisions to ensure that the powers will be rescinded once the threat passes.
