With the sixth-worst death toll in the world, Brazil [has emerged as the new coronavirus hotspot.](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-cases-maps-us-world-spread-symptoms-death-rate-2020-1?r=US&IR=T)

Brazil's hospitals, morgues, and cemeteries has been grappling with a rising number of coronavirus cases, which were first brought into the country by people traveling back from Europe and the US in February.

But despite growing concern that the country will record thousands of more deaths from the virus, its president — Jair Bolsonaro — never imposed a nation-wide lockdown.

Bolsonaro [continues to downplay the threat of the virus, attending anti-lockdown protests and starting feuds with state governors](https://www.businessinsider.com/brazil-coronavirus-no-nationwide-lockdown-results-are-grim-2020-5?r=US&IR=T), who have gone against his orders by individually issuing partial lockdowns.

Photos show what it's like in Brazil as its rapidly becoming one of the worst-hit countries from the coronavirus in the world.

While some countries are starting to lift lockdown measures after seeing a drop in coronavirus cases, Brazil is quickly emerging as the world’s new hotspot.

The South American country recorded its deadliest day from the virus on May 12 and now has more than 190,000 cases — a number which is likely to be a lot higher.

Experts say that the actual number of cases is probably 15 times higher than what has been reported due to the lack of testing in the country, according to the BBC.

Domingo Alves from the University of Säo Paulo Medical School told the broadcaster: "Brazil is only testing people who end up in the hospital. It's hard to know what's really happening based on the available data."

"We don't have a real policy to manage the outbreak," he added.

The virus appears to have been brought into the country by people who traveled to Europe and the US during public holidays in February.

But while the country saw a spike in infections, it still went ahead with its annual Carnival celebration. At this point, the coronavirus had already spread to 20 countries.

Many of the early infections were seen in rich neighborhoods of large cities, including Copacabana in Rio de Janeiro. But it only took a few weeks before the virus made its way to Brazil's poorest areas — the favelas.

Wallace Pereira, a community leader in Rocinha — the largest favela in Brazil — told the Guardian: "We're facing a public disaster here. People are getting sick and they have nowhere to go."

"The situation is getting worse because many people are going around saying: 'This virus won't get me' – which is a fantasy," Pereira added.

With cramped homes, large households, and few public parks, social isolation is very difficult in many of the country's favelas.

Another problem in the favelas seems to be a lack of awareness.

Rene Silva, the director of the Voz das Comunidades newspaper which produced for and by people in Rio de Janeiro's favelas, told [The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/coronavirus-brazil-favelas-cases-deaths-rio-de-janeiro-a9480076.html): "[People in the favelas] don't think that coronavirus is something serious."

"They think this is a disease for rich people, that is something from abroad that won't affect them," Silva added.

In early April, Brazilian health officials confirmed that COVID-19 had even reached a remote Yanomami tribe in the Amazon.

Public officials have been under increasing pressure to further clamp down with lockdown measures, as the situation seems to be getting worse in the country.

Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazil's non-profit Institute for Health Policy Studies, told the Associated Press that mandatory lockdowns across much of the country would help.

"We need to avoid a total disaster. It is late in terms of avoiding hospital collapse, but certainly, it isn't too late to avoid a bigger catastrophe," Lago said.

However, most governors and mayors have not yet imposed mandatory stay-at-home orders.

On different occasions, they have been joined by Bolsonaro, who told the protestors they were "patriots" for defending their individual freedoms.

But Bolsonaro has also been heavily criticized. Nurses and doctors have staged several protests against the deaths of their colleagues and state governors have ignored his orders.

Bolsonaro's popularity has suffered since the crisis began, with his disapproval rating rising to more than 55% from 47% in January, [according to a new survey released in the Guardian.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/13/global-report-brazil-and-mexico-record-deadliest-day-from-covid-19)

This week the Brazilian president said that beauty salons, gyms, and barbers can "re-open" as they should be treated as "essential services" — a decree that was ignored by several state governors, who worry that the situation is only getting worse.

[Rio de Janeiro governor, Wilson Witzel tweeted on Tuesday, May 12:](https://twitter.com/wilsonwitzel/status/1260221208135708678) "Bolsonaro is walking toward the precipice and wants to take all of us with him."

Davi Alcolumbre, the head of Brazil's Senate, [previously said the country needs "serious, responsible leadership"](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-jair-bolsonaro-suggests-brazilians-immune-to-disease-baseless-2020-3?r=US&IR=T) in times like this, according to the BBC.

Both sides have threatened to take their fight to court.

With more than 13,000 COVID-19 deaths at the time of writing, Brazil is now the sixth worst-affected country in the world in terms of recorded deaths.
