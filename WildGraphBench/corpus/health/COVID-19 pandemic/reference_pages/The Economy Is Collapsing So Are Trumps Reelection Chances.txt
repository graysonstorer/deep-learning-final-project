The Economy Is Collapsing. So Are Trump’s Reelection Chances.
=============================================================

This year’s projected headline numbers look dire for the president.

For Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, many numbers matter: the number of Americans who get sick and perish from the coronavirus. The number of months before the economy begins to reopen and rebound. The number of Americans who lose their health insurance and home after losing their job. For political scientists, one number is of particular interest, and it currently stands at –18.3.

That is an estimate of how fast the economy is collapsing in the second quarter, an annualized rate derived by Mark Zandi of Moody’s Analytics. It is a measure of how much less the American economy is producing as businesses close and joblessness swells and the pandemic kills. And it is one of the [strongest predictors](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/measuring-the-effect-of-the-economy-on-elections/) of whether an incumbent is likely to win reelection: An additional percentage point of GDP growth translates roughly into an [additional](https://sites.middlebury.edu/presidentialpower/tag/gdp/)[percentage point](https://my.vanderbilt.edu/larrybartels/files/2011/12/CSDI_WP_04-2013.pdf) of the vote share. Americans are seeing their economy evaporate at the fastest pace in modern history, and that foretells a Democratic landslide in the fall.

Or perhaps not. The coronavirus pandemic is a black-swan crisis happening to a singular president in an extreme political environment. A number that might signal unavoidable doom for another candidate in another election might not for Trump come November.
