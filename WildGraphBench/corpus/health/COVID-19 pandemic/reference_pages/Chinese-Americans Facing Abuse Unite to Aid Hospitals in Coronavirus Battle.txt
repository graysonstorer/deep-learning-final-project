Although many have weathered racist remarks and some physical attacks over the virus, Chinese-Americans are tapping their deep social networks to procure medical supplies.

Dr. Peter Lee, an emergency room doctor from Montville, N.J., was close to an emotional breakdown by the time he took to WeChat, the social media app, last month.

He was under siege on all fronts. At work, he was constantly dodging exposure to [the coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/podcasts/the-daily/racism-chinese-coronavirus-asian-americans.html). At home, he was worried about infecting his pregnant wife and young daughters. And in his everyday life, he was suddenly navigating a new bias against Chinese-Americans.

“Comments like calling this ‘the Chinese virus’ have ramifications for someone like me,” said Dr. Lee, 34, whose father moved from Beijing to Albany, N.Y., with $60 in his pocket in 1986. “They fuel a certain prejudice against my kind.”

But his March 20 post on WeChat was about the most imminent danger facing him and his co-workers: a lack of personal protection equipment, particularly masks and gowns.

Three days later, Dr. Lee’s desperate plea for protective gear had worked. Members of the [Millburn Short Hills Chinese Association](https://millburnchinese.membershiptoolkit.com/), based about 20 miles from Montville, saw his post and took action, raising more than $50,000 and obtaining 10,000 masks, gowns and other pieces of equipment from a Chinese company with a warehouse in Queens. The gear was distributed to [Envision Physician Services](https://www.envisionphysicianservices.com/), Dr. Lee’s employer, as well as to other organizations.
