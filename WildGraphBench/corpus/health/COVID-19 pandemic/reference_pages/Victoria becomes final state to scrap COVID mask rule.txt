Face masks will not be required on public transport or in taxis, rideshare services and tourism vehicles from 11.59pm on Thursday 22 September.

The decision has been made with COVID case numbers in mind, with Victorian Health and Ambulance Services minister Mary-Anne Thomas saying they are “well below their winter peak”.

Thomas said she received advice from the state’s Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton before announcing the change, but still strongly recommends mask wearing on public transport in line with the existing indoor mask recommendations.

When it is impossible to physically distance, and for anyone who may be immunocompromised or vulnerable to COVID, mask wearing is still strongly encouraged.

“As we move to living with COVID, it’s important we ensure enduring behaviour change in the community – and that means giving people the choice to wear masks to protect themselves and those around them,” Thomas said.

“These sensible changes provide consistency for the community on mask wearing requirements and I thank the Chief Health Officer for his advice on this matter.”

Previously Victorian passengers were required to wear masks unless they have a valid exemption, with a $100 penalty for dissenters.

The state has reminded Victorians ahead of Thursday to stay up to date with COVID vaccinations, and encouraged them to get tested if symptoms appear.

Mask requirements across Australia
----------------------------------

Massive changes to mask requirements have been made in recent days across Australia.

As of Thursday, all states will no longer mandate masks on public transport, but each state recommends their use and still requires mask wearing in some sensitive settings.

Here’s what you need to know.

**Western Australia**

Mask requirements for public transport, rideshares and domestic air travel were eased on 9 September.

However, in “high-risk settings” such as hospital, health clinics, corrections facilities, aged care settings and disability services, masks are still mandated.

People are “encouraged” to wear masks in crowded indoor spaces “to help protect vulnerable members of the community”.

**Queensland**

The Sunshine state allowed public transport commuters - as well as rideshare passengers - to ditch their masks on Wednesday, September 21.

However mandates exist for healthcare settings, residential aged care and disability accommodation, according to Queensland Health.

There is also a requirement for people outside their home to wear a mask if they have COVID or COVID symptoms, are waiting for COVID test results, are a close contact of a COVID case or have a temperature of 37.5C or above.

**Northern Territory**

The territory updated its rules on Monday and now only requires people 12 years or older to wear a mask in hospitals, health facilities, aged care residences, disability facilities, correctional facilities, homeless and domestic violence shelters.

“You are no longer required to wear a face mask in most indoor settings in the Northern Territory, but wearing a mask remains strongly recommended,” NT Health says on its website.

“You should wear a mask when you cannot physically distance from others.”

**South Australia**

The state has a specific list of settings where masks are mandatory.

That includes health care services, pharmacies, disability care facilities and aged care homes.

It stipulates health care services include hospitals, general practices, medical specialist services and practices, mental health services and practices including drug and alcohol services, allied health services, complementary and alternative therapy services and practices including Chinese medicine practitioners, dental services, pathology clinics, sexual health clinics, radiology services, disability and rehabilitation services.

**Tasmania**

People in the island state must wear a mask only if they have COVID-19 or are a close contact and outside their home.

People who emerge from their five days of COVID isolation must wear a mask in all indoor settings until the seventh day after their diagnosis.

Masks are not required in other situations, but authorities state some places such as hospitals might request people wear masks.

“Please be respectful and carry a mask with you in case you need to wear one,” the Tasmanian Department of Health says.

**Victoria**

The mask mandate on public transport and rideshares in the state will be scrapped from 11.59pm on 22 September.

Masks are also required in “sensitive settings” such as hospitals.

**New South Wales**

With Wednesday’s removal of the public transport mandate, people in NSW older than 12 are only required to wear masks in public hospitals, private health facilities and residential aged care.

Close COVID contacts are instructed to wear masks in indoors settings outside their homes.
