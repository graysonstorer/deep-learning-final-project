# Global 

# January 21, 2022 

This document contains summary information on the latest projections from the IHME 

model on COVID -19 globally. The model was run on January 20, 2022, with data through 

January 18, 2022. 

The global Omicron wave continues to unfold. The only countries that have not begun their 

Omicron surge include most of Southeast Asia with the exception of the Philippines, China, 

New Zealand, Libya , and Slovakia. In this week’s update, we model i n the reference 

scenario a national Omicron outbreak in China beginning in February. Multiple countries 

or states/regions within countries have already peaked and begun to decline. From initial 

surge in reported cases to the peak, the interval is consist ently between 20 and 25 days 

regardless of vaccination levels or prevalence of past infection. The likely explanation is the 

extremely high transmissibility of Omicron and considerable immune escape from vaccine -

derived and infection -acquired immunity. Perhaps the most important insight is the 

extraordinary speed of the Omicron wave and the likelihood that nearly all countries will be 

through the wave by mid -March. The unprecedented level of infection is creating heavy 

pressure on health systems but for tunately is not leading to a major surge in deaths from 

COVID -19. 

Given what we have learned about the speed and intensity of the Omicron wave, policy 

interventions appear to have a very limited impact in the short run. In our scenarios, 

expanding mask use or third -dose vaccination speeds the decline of transmission , but 

compared to previous variants these effects are quite modest. Testing, tracing , and 

quarantine are unlikely to have an impact given the volume of infection in most countries. 

Acutely, th e main efforts of governments should focus on supporting health systems that 

face pressure due to the surge in COVID -19 -related admissions, the large number of 

admissions for other health problems that have incidental COVID -19 infections requiring 

infection c ontrol measures , and the shortages of health workers due to quarantine. Given 

the rapid wave, governments may want to keep in place existing measures and mandates 

and consider removing them in a few weeks after transmission drops , just to be cautious. 

Aft er the Omicron wave subsides, high levels of infection -acquired and vaccine -derived 

immunity should lead to low levels of transmission for many weeks or months. In the 

Northern Hemisphere, further reductions in transmission potential over the summer may 

ex tend the period of low COVID -19 infections into later in the year. covid19.healthdata.org 2 Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 

COVID -19 will return, however, for two reasons. First, vaccine -derived and infection -

derived immunity preventing infection will steadily wane. Waning immunity and winter 

seasonality lat er in 2022 should lead at least to a winter increase in the Northern 

Hemisphere and possibly an earlier return in the Southern Hemisphere winter. Second, 

new variants are highly likely to emerge. In fact, the billions of global infections occurring 

in the world from the end of November to March 1 may have created the opportunity for 

new variants to emerge already. To prepare for future COVID -19 variants , governments 

should maintain surveillance and monitor for the emergence of new variants, continue to 

promote vaccination including third doses where vaccines are available, scale up access to 

effective anti virals, and provide guidance for high -risk groups to use high -quality masks 

and social distance if and when a new variant that is more severe than Omicron emerges. 

Accelerating access to anti virals in low - and middle -income countries takes on greater 

importance. With these measures in place, even the emergence of a new variant with 

increased severity as compared to Omicron should not require the r eturn to pandemic -era 

mandates. 

# Current situation 

• Estimated d aily infections in the last week increased to 95 .2 million per day on 

average compared to 90 .4 million the week before (Figure 1.1). 

• Daily hospital census in the last week (through January 18) increased to 1 .6 million 

per day on average compared to 1 .1 million the week before. 

• Daily reported cases in the last week increased to 3 .0 million per day on average 

compared to 2 .6 million the week before (Figure 2.1). 

• Reported deaths due to COVID -19 in the last week increased to 7,400 per day on 

average compared to 7,000 the week before (Figure 3.1). 

• Total deaths due to COVID -19 in the last week increased to 13,600 per day on average 

compared to 12,600 the week before ( Figure 3.1). This makes COVID -19 the number 3 

cause of death globally this week (Table 1). Estimated total daily deaths due to 

COVID -19 in the past week were 1.8 times larger than the reported number of deaths. 

• The daily rate of reported deaths due to COVI D-19 is greater than 4 per million in 28 

countries and no subnational locations (Figure 4.1). 

• The daily rate of total deaths due to COVID -19 is greater than 4 per million in 58 

countries and no subnational locations (Figure 4.2). 

• We estimate that 57% of people globally ha ve been infected at least once as of January 

18 (Figure 6.1). 

• Effective R, computed using cases, hospitalizations, and deaths, is greater than 1 in 

110 countries and 136 subnational locations (Figure 7.1). Transmission is declining in 

much of sub -Saharan Africa, Canada, the e astern and southern USA, Western and 

Southern Europe , and Australia. 

• The infection -detection rate globally was close to 4% on January 18 (Figure 8.1). covid19.healthdata.org 3 Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 

• Based on the GISAID and various national databases, combined with ou r variant 

spread model, we estimate the current prevalence of variants of concern (Figure s 9.1 –

9.5). Omicron is dominant in nearly all countries. 

# Trends in drivers of transmission 

• Mobility last week was 9% higher than the pre -COVID -19 baseline (Fig ure 11.1). 

Mobility was lower than 30% of baseline in no locations. 

• As of January 18, in the COVID -19 Trends and Impact Survey, 55% of people self -

report that they always wore a mask when leaving their home (Figure 13.1). 

• There were 176 diagnostic tests pe r 100,000 people on January 18 (Figure 15.1). 

• As of January 18, 70 countries and no subnational locations have reached 70% or more 

of the population who have received at least one vaccine dose , and 44 countries and no 

subnational locations have reached 70% or more of the pop ulation who are fully 

vaccinated (Figure 17.1). 61% of people globally have received at least one vaccine dose 

and 52% are fully vaccinated. First -dose vaccination rates less than 50% are seen in 

most countries in Africa, parts of Eastern Europe, and sele ct countries in other 

regions. 

• Global ly , 68.2% of the population that is 12 years and older say they would accept or 

would probably accept a vaccine for COVID -19. Note that vaccine acceptance is 

calculated using survey data from the 18+ population. The p roportion of the population 

who are open to receiving a COVID -19 vaccine ranges from 31% in Namibia to 100% in 

United Arab Emirates (Figure 19.1). 

• In our current reference scenario, we expect that 5.0 billion people will be vaccinated 

with at least one dos e by May 1 (Figure 20.1). We expect that 59% of the population 

will be fully vaccinated by May 1. 

# Projections 

Infections 

• Daily estimated infections in the reference scenario , which represent s what we 

think is most likely to happen, have peaked and will decline to 1 .4 million on May 1, 

2022 (Figure 21.1). 

• Daily estimated infections in the 80% mask coverage scenario decline faster from 

the peak than in the reference scenario (Figure 21.1). 

• Dail y estimated infections in the third dose scenario will decline slightly faster than 

in the reference scenario (Figure 21.1). 

Cases 

• Daily cases in the reference scenario peak at 3.1 million cases on January 21 and 

then decline rapidly , reaching below 500,0 00 by mid -March (Figure 21.2). covid19.healthdata.org 4 Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation 

• Daily cases in the 80% mask coverage scenario decline more rapidly than in the 

reference scenario (Figure 21.2). 

• Daily cases in the third dose scenario decline more rapidly than in the reference 

scenario (Figure 21.2). 

Hospit alizations 

• Daily hospital census in the reference scenario will rise to 2 .3 million by the end of 

January and then decline (Figure 21.3). 

• Daily hospital census in the 80% mask coverage scenario will rise to 2 .2 million in 

the last week of January and then decline (Figure 21.3). 

• Daily hospital census in the third dose scenario is similar to the reference scenario 

but with a slightly faster decline from the peak ( Figure 21.3). 

Deaths 

• In our reference scenario , our model projects 6,334,000 cumulative rep orted deaths 

due to COVID -19 on May 1. This represents 275,000 additional deaths from January 

18 to May 1. Daily reported COVID -19 deaths in the reference scenario will rise to 

7,190 by January 22, 2022 , and then decline (Figure 21.4). 

• Under our reference s cenario , our model projects 13,472,000 cumulative total deaths 

due to COVID -19 on May 1. This represents 613,000 additional deaths from January 

18 to May 1 (Figure 24.2). 

• In our 80% mask coverage scenario , our model projects 6,318,000 cumulative 

reported d eaths due to COVID -19 on May 1. This represents 259,000 additional deaths 

from January 18 to May 1. Daily reported COVID -19 deaths in the 80% mask 

coverage scenario will rise to 7,190 by January 22, 2022 (Figure 21.4). 

• In our third dose scenario , our model projects 6,321,000 cumulative reported deaths 

due to COVID -19 on May 1. This represents 262,000 additional deaths from January 

18 to May 1. Daily reported COVID -19 deaths in the third dose scenario will rise to 

7,100 by January 21, 2022 (Figure 21.4). 

• At some point from January through May 1, 33 countries will have high or extreme 

stress on hospital beds (Figure 23.1). At some point from January through May 1, 48 

countries will have high or extreme stress on intensive care unit (ICU) capacity

Projections and scenarios 

We produce 3 scenarios when projecting COVID-19. The reference scenario is our forecast of what we think is most likely to happen: 

• Vaccines are distributed at the expected pace. Brand- and variant-specific vaccine efficacy is updated using the latest available information from peer-reviewed publications and other reports. 

• Future mask use is the mean of mask use over the last 7 days. 

• Mobility increases as vaccine coverage increases. 

• Omicron variant spreads according to our flight and local spread model. 

• 80% of those who have had two doses of vaccine (or one dose for Johnson & Johnson) receive a third dose at 6 months after their second dose. The 80% mask use scenario makes all the same assumptions as the reference scenario but assumes all locations reach 80% mask use within 7 days. If a location currently has higher than 80% use, mask use remains at the current level. The third dose scenario is the same as the reference scenario but assumes that 100% of those who have received two doses of vaccine will get a third dose at 6 months. covid19.healthdata.org Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation Global
