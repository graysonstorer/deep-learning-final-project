Novavax Inc.  said Monday it has been granted U.S. Food and Drug Administration fast track designation for its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, a move that should accelerate development of the vaccine. The company is aiming to get the candidate, called NVXCoV2373, into a Phase 3 trial in the U.S. and Mexico by end-November. "While the regulatory review of this clinical program will be expedited, Novavax remains committed to a data-driven and scientifically rigorous approach in demonstrating safety and efficacy, which we believe will support confidence in the vaccine in the U.S. and globally," Gregory M. Glenn, president of R&D at Novavax, said in a statement. Earlier, Pfizer Inc.  and BioNTech  said a Phase 3 trial of their vaccine candidate found it was 90% effective, sparking a sweeping market rally that sent Dow futures up 1,500 points. Novavax shares were down 3% premarket, but have gained more than 2,000% in 2020 so far. The SPDR S&P Biotech ETF  has gained 26% and the S&P) 500  has gained 8.6%.
