Italy saw the fewest number of daily coronavirus deaths in a week on Sunday, according to news reports.

The country reported 433 deaths on Sunday, the lowest since last Sunday, when 431 deaths were recorded, according to [Bloomberg News](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-19/italy-reports-fewest-deaths-in-a-week-new-cases-ease?utm_content=politics&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-politics&utm_campaign=socialflow-organic) and [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-italy-tally/italys-daily-coronavirus-death-toll-hits-one-week-low-idUSKBN2210NR). On Saturday, the death toll dropped to 482 from Friday’s 575.

The number of new daily coronavirus cases hit a four-day low at 3,047 new cases Sunday, compared to 3,491 on Saturday. But more hospitalizations were reported for the first time in six days, according to Bloomberg News.

The lower daily death toll and number of new cases highlights a plateau that contrasts with the sharp rises that were occurring at the end of March.

Some business leaders and regional chiefs are calling for a loosening of restrictions after the country has been on lockdown for six weeks. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte is standing up to the pressure, saying on Saturday that the nation is not ready for reopening and counting out that some regions could open before others.

Health experts are also urging the European nation to be cautious, saying it’s too early to begin the reopening process. The lockdown is scheduled to end May 3.

The northern region of Lombardy, which includes Milan, reported more than a third of the country’s deaths.
