OTTAWA – As he dealt with an outbreak in his own home Friday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his government announced new aggressive measures aimed at responding to the growing threat of the COVID-19 virus.

“Every order of government is working to stop the spread of the virus,” he said. “We will get through this together.”

With details still to come, the government is restricting international flights into Canada and encouraging Canadians not to travel outside the country. Late Friday, Global Affairs Canada encouraged all Canadians abroad to return home by commercial means.

Trudeau also announced support for the ailing economy, hit both by a price war hitting the energy sector and a calamitous and record-setting drop in financial markets.

Under a deal announced early Friday, Parliament will also be suspended until April 20 and the budget postponed to an unspecified future date.

The prime minister spoke just outside Rideau Cottage, where he is now in self isolation, alongside his children. He went into isolation Thursday after his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau tested positive for the virus. During the press conference, Trudeau stood about four metres from reporters and he has been communicating with staff and cabinet ministers through phone and video conference.

Grégoire Trudeau’s symptoms are mild, but Trudeau has not been tested for the virus. He said that’s on the best advice of health authorities, because he is not showing any symptoms.

He said the isolation has been an inconvenience for him and his family, but it’s a necessary one and a sacrifice many people in Canada are making to protect others.

“We have to do this, because we have to protect our neighbours and our friends.”

Trudeau was set to hold a conference call Friday with provincial premiers. He had originally been scheduled to meet them in person in Ottawa, but those plans were abandoned when he went into isolation. He said he wants to ensure the provinces have all the resources they need to fight the virus.

“We will make sure we align our response across the country, addressing COVID 19 must be a Team Canada effort.”

There were 157 cases in the country as of Friday morning, with one death in British Columbia.

Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, said there have been more than 15,000 individuals tested with the vast majority coming back negative.

She stressed that it’s time for people to avoid any non-essential travel and embrace the staycation.

“While making the choice to stay at home and not travel outside of Canada, you are protecting yourself, your family and doing your part to help us slow the spread of coronavirus and protect the most vulnerable in our communities.”

She also advised people returning from abroad to self isolate for 14 days to reduce the possibility the virus will spread.

People coming into Canada from elsewhere will have fewer places to land, as the government announced it would streamline international arrivals to a few airports and ramp up screening on their arrival.

> Addressing COVID 19 must be a Team Canada effort

Trudeau said at this point, they’re not closing Canada’s borders with any country, but he didn’t rule out the possibility that could change.

“We will make those decisions based on the best science and the best recommendations of our health officials.”

The government’s purchasing website also had a call out for businesses that can supply surgical and N95 masks, gloves, hand sanitizer and other medical supplies.

U.S. President Donald Trump declared a national emergency due to the virus, which was set to free up $50 billion in funding to deal with the outbreak.

Economically, Trudeau promised a significant fiscal stimulus package in the coming days. He said it would help Canadians directly during this difficult time.

“We do not want any Canadian to have to worry about whether or not they will be able to pay their rent, whether or not they will be able to buy groceries.”

He said if someone should be in isolation or working from home, he doesn’t want finances to stay in the way.

“We need to make sure Canadians have the options and the ability to follow the best advice.”

Financial markets have fallen dramatically this week, with the Toronto Stock Exchange seeing two of the worst days it has ever had. In addition to the promised stimulus, Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced the government would offer credit to businesses and the Bank of Canada cut interest rates again.

“We are going to do whatever it takes to protect Canadians and keep our economy strong,” said Morneau.

Government house leader Pablo Rodriguez announced the suspension of parliament with representatives from the Bloc Québécois, Conservatives and NDP, stressing it was the product of cooperation.

“It’s important to mention we did this together and it’s the right thing to do,” he said.

Conservative whip Mark Strahl said it was the right choice for a difficult in time and they would continue to hold the government to account, just without the benefit of question period.

The new NAFTA agreement, which had been the subject of intense debate since Parliament returned was passed as part of the agreement and then expedited through a rare Friday sitting of the Senate.

The budget set for March 30 is now delayed to an unspecified future date.

The parties also agreed to a process that could see parliament recalled to pass important legislation, but with smaller numbers, with only those MPs who can travel without an airplane returning.

Parliament Hill itself would also be closed for public tours or events and all of Canada’s national museums in Ottawa announced they too would close their doors.
