The United States has been facing a COVID-19 surge as the more contagious delta variant continues to spread.

More than 712,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 while over 4.8 million people have died from the disease worldwide, according to real-time [data](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.

Just 66% of Americans ages 12 and up are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, according to [data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-total-admin-rate-total) from the CDC.

90% of eligible Hawaii residents have received 1 dose
-----------------------------------------------------

Hawaii became the first state in the country to have 90% of its population 12 and older receive at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, the [U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Sunday afternoon](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations_vacc-people-onedose-pop-12yr).

Over 1,090,157 residents have received one dose, the CDC reported.

In August, Hawaii Gov. David Ige urged people to avoid non-essential travel to the state as it dealt with a summer surge in cases and hospitalizations.

The seven-day average of new daily COVID-19 cases has dropped from 1,060 on Sept. 2 to 192 on Oct. 8, [the CDC reported](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#trends_dailycases).

Anti-vaccine Texas gubernatorial candidate tests positive, 'probably' will be hospitalized
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Allen West, a Republican candidate for Texas governor, said Saturday he "probably" will be hospitalized due to COVID-19 pneumonia one day after saying he was suffering "a low grade fever and light body aches" without specifying a positive test for COVID.

He said his blood oxygen levels currently stand at 89 and should be about 95.

"My chest X-rays do show COVID pneumonia, not serious. I am probably going to be admitted to the hospital," the outspoken and controversial politician wrote on Twitter.

West's wife, Angela, did test positive for COVID on Friday, according to the candidate's Twitter account. She had been vaccinated against the virus.

The 60-year-old West, a retired lieutenant colonel in the Army and former congressman from Florida, has chosen not to get vaccinated and is instead touting his use of [hydroxychloroquine](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/panel-advises-hydroxychloroquine-prevent-covid-19/story?id=76186122) and [ivermectin](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/ivermectin-deworming-drug-treat-covid-health-officials/story?id=79568887), two drugs the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/nih-research-matters/hydroxychloroquine-doesnt-benefit-hospitalized-covid-19-patients) and [Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19) say should not be used to treat or prevent the virus.

West is also the former chairman of the Republican Party of Texas. He announced he was running for governor in next year's election, against Republican Greg Abbott, in July.

He suspended all in-person campaign events on Friday after his wife tested positive.

US reports highest weekly vaccinations since July 4, White House says
---------------------------------------------------------------------

The United States has administered the highest number of weekly vaccinations since early July, a White House official said.

There were more than 7 million COVID-19 vaccine doses reported in the past week, the highest seven-day total since July 4, White House COVID-19 data director Dr. Cyrus Shahpar said on Twitter Saturday.

The uptick comes amid a [push for employee vaccinations](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-illinois-push-vaccine-mandates-large-businesses/story?id=80460564) and the rollout of booster shots.

Over 76% of people ages 12 and up in the U.S. have gotten at least one dose.

Spirit Airlines to require vaccines for employees
-------------------------------------------------

Spirit Airlines is joining other major carriers and will soon require all employees to be vaccinated. A deadline for the vaccination requirement has not been announced.

Delta is now the only major carrier to not have an employee vaccine mandate. However, in November the airline will begin charging unvaccinated employees an additional $200 per month for health insurance.
