*   As the novel coronavirus continues to spread, some countries are putting their citizens on various forms of lockdown, though that's not a technical term used by public-health officials.
*   Most countries, including Spain, Germany, and South Korea, have started relaxing lockdown measures. The results have been mixed.
*   [More than 965,742 people have died](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-virus-everything-we-know-deadly-2019-ncov-wuhan-spread-2020-1) and over 31,365,633 have been infected by the coronavirus worldwide.
*   [Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories](https://www.businessinsider.com/?hprecirc-bullet).

Countries around the world are implementing measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, from national quarantines to school closures.

Several [countries](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-spain-denmark-italy-austria-start-reopening-economy-2020-4) (like Spain, Iran, Italy, Denmark, Israel, and Germany) that previously imposed restrictions are beginning to lift lockdown measures. But results have been mixed.

While "lockdown" isn't a technical term used by public-health officials, it can refer to anything from mandatory geographic quarantines to non-mandatory recommendations to stay at home, closures of certain types of businesses, or bans on events and gatherings, Lindsay Wiley, a health law professor at the Washington College of Law, [told Vox](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2020/3/10/21171464/coronavirus-us-lock-down-travel-restriction-italy).

Here are the countries and territories that have implemented mandatory mass quarantines so far — and how some of them are beginning to open up.

Restrictions have again been lifted in New Zealand.

[The Associated Press reports](https://apnews.com/a38c6b2ae8f95619b63e8d5040562725) that restrictions lifted everywhere but the city of Auckland on Monday.

On Wednesday, the number of people who can gather in Auckland will rise from 10 to 100, and restrictions will be completely lifted after two weeks.

In Germany, the state of Bavaria is enacting new restrictions, but the country likely won't have to go back into a full lockdown.

The state of Bavaria announced new coronavirus restrictions on Tuesday, per [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-germany-idUSKCN26D218).

The measures, which will begin on Wednesday, include limiting gatherings and how many households can mingle, and a curfew on restaurants from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.

However, as [Yahoo News reports](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/coronavirus-germany-top-virologist-no-second-national-lockdown-095823268.html), a top virologist says the country will not necessarily need to go into a full lockdown again.

China implemented what was then the largest quarantine in human history to contain the coronavirus, locking down at least 16 cities at the end of January. The lockdown on Wuhan ended on April 8.

Brazil trails only the US and India in its number of infections and deaths.

Major city Rio de Janeiro has reopened as the country heads into its warmer months, [according to Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-brazil-rio/brazils-rio-risks-second-wave-of-covid-19-with-ill-timed-reopening-idUSL1N2GC240), sparking fears that a hard-hit city will suffer more infections.

A group that represents over 1 million medical professionals has accused President Jair Bolsonaro of a crime against humanity and filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court, [according to NPR](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/27/895940087/brazils-bolsonaro-is-accused-of-crime-against-humanity-over-coronavirus-neglect).

Jair Bolsonaro has [downplayed the pandemic and even encouraged anti-lockdown protesters](https://www.businessinsider.com/brazil-coronavirus-no-nationwide-lockdown-results-are-grim-2020-5?r=US&IR=T) — and he has argued with governors who imposed stay-at-home orders.

He later [tested positive for the coronavirus;](https://www.businessinsider.com/brazilian-president-jair-bolsonaro-tests-positive-for-covid-19-2020-7?utmSource=twitter&utmContent=referral&utmTerm=topbar&referrer=twitter)[two other government ministers have also tested positive, NPR reports](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/07/21/893416808/brazil-tops-80-000-covid-19-deaths-as-2-government-ministers-test-positive-for-v).

As cases in Spain — and particularly Madrid — increase, the city is implementing localized lockdowns, [according to the BBC](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-54227057).

And residents have pushed back against being told to remain in their "zones," with some arguing that it is a "class-based lockdown," per the BBC.

The country has had more than [30,663 deaths and 671,468 cases as of Tuesday](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html).

The country is notable for its "[low-scale](https://www.businessinsider.com/photos-life-in-sweden-europe-lockdown-coronavirus-2020-4)" lockdown.

But the country did seem to be bringing the virus under control, [Bloomberg reports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-07-28/sweden-unveils-promising-covid-19-data-as-new-cases-plunge).

The scientist behind the country's plan was unsure whether it [made the right decision](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-sweden-no-lockdown-anders-tegnell-not-convinced-right-call-2020-5). The country likely won't avoid [pandemic-related economic fallout](https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-economy-likely-wont-benefit-from-decision-avoid-lockdown-report-2020-5).

"I'm not convinced at all," state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell [told Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet](https://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/samhalle/a/70O6kV/tegnell-darfor-har-fler-dott-i-sverige-an-i-ovriga-norden). On "The Daily Show with Trevor Noah," [he said](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-sweden-lockdown-chief-says-high-death-toll-was-surprise-2020-5) that the "death toll really came as a surprise to us." Scientists in the country have also [spoken out against the approach](https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-coronavirus-plan-is-a-cruel-mistake-skeptical-experts-say-2020-5); testing in the [country has lagged](https://www.businessinsider.com/sweden-coronavirus-testing-lags-patients-say-they-cant-be-treated-2020-6), and a [commission has been formed to evaluate its response](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-sweden-commission/sweden-starts-critical-look-at-its-pandemic-response-idUSKBN2412YV). A [University of Virginia analysis](https://news.virginia.edu/content/lack-covid-19-lockdown-increased-deaths-sweden-analysis-concludes)found that the choice not to lock down led to more deaths.

Many countries have also closed borders to prevent international travelers from spreading the virus.
