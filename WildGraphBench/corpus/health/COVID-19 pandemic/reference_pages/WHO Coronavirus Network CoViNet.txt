WHO Coronavirus Network (CoViNet)
---------------------------------

The WHO Coronavirus Network (CoViNet) aims to bring together surveillance programs and reference laboratories to support enhanced epidemiological monitoring and laboratory (phenotypic and genotypic) assessment of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and novel coronaviruses of public health importance.

COVID-19 Variants of Concern (VOCs)
-----------------------------------

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and with the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, multiple COVID-19 Variants of Concern (VOCs) and Variants of Interest (VOIs) have been designated by WHO based on their assessed potential for expansion and replacement of prior variants, for causing new waves with increased circulation, and for the need for adjustments to public health actions.

### Glossary and definitions

| COVID-19 variants | It is usual for viruses to change and evolve as they spread between people over time. When these changes become significantly different to a previously detected virus, these new virus types are known as “variants.” To identify variants, scientists map the genetic material of viruses (known as sequencing) and then look for differences between them to see if they have changed. Since 2020, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has been spreading and changing globally. These changes have led to the detection of variants in many countries around the world. The more significant of these variants are grouped in three different ways – variants under monitoring, variants of interest and variants of concern. |
| --- |
| Variant under Monitoring (VUM) | A Variant Under Monitoring (VUM) is a term used to signal to public health authorities that a SARS-CoV-2 variant may require prioritized attention and monitoring. The main objective of this category is to investigate if this variant (and others closely related to it) may pose an additional threat to global public health as compared to other circulating variants. |
| Variant of Interest (VOI) | A Variant of Interest (VOI) is a term used to describe a SARS-CoV-2 variant with changes that are known to affect how the virus behaves or its potential impact on human health. This can include, for example, its ability to spread, its ability to cause serious disease, or how easily it may be detected or treated. A VOI may also be identified because it has an increased ability to spread when compared with other circulating variants, suggesting a potential emerging risk to global public health. |
| Variant of Concern (VOC) | A Variant of Concern (VOC) is a term that describes a SARS-CoV-2 variant that meets the definition of a VOI (see above), but also meets at least one of the following criteria when compared with other variants: * it can cause a detrimental change in disease severity; * it can have a substantial impact on the ability of health systems to provide care to patients with COVID-19 or other illnesses and therefore require major public health interventions; or * there is a significant decrease in the effectiveness of available vaccines in protecting against severe disease. A VOC variant will be assigned a greek letter. |
