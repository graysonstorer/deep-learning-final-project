### How we process data at Our World in Data

All data and visualizations on Our World in Data rely on data sourced from one or several original data providers. Preparing this original data involves several processing steps. Depending on the data, this can include standardizing country names and world region definitions, converting units, calculating derived indicators such as per capita measures, as well as adding or adapting metadata such as the name or the description given to an indicator.

At the link below you can find a detailed description of the structure of our data pipeline, including links to all the code used to prepare data across Our World in Data.

[Read about our data pipeline](https://docs.owid.io/projects/etl/)

##### Notes on our processing step for this indicator

Comparisons across countries are affected by differences in testing policies and reporting methods.
