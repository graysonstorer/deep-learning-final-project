Watch for symptoms
------------------

People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported – ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness. Symptoms may appear **2-14 days after exposure****to the virus.** People with these symptoms may have COVID-19:

*   Fever or chills
*   Cough
*   Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing
*   Fatigue
*   Muscle or body aches
*   Headache
*   New loss of taste or smell
*   Sore throat
*   Congestion or runny nose

When to seek emergency medical attention

Look for [](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/symptoms.html "WarningSigns")**emergency warning signs***for COVID-19. If someone is showing any of these signs, **seek emergency medical care****immediately:**

*   Trouble breathing
*   Persistent pain or pressure in the chest
*   New confusion
*   Inability to wake or stay awake
*   Pale, gray, or blue-colored skin, lips, or nail beds, depending on skin tone

*This list is not all possible symptoms. Please call your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.

**Call 911 or call ahead to your local emergency facility:**Notify the operator that you are seeking care for someone who has or may have COVID-19.

What is the difference between Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19?
------------------------------------------------------------

Influenza (Flu) and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses. COVID-19 is caused by infection with a new coronavirus (called SARS-CoV-2), and flu is caused by infection with [influenza viruses](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/viruses/index.htm).

COVID-19 seems to spread more easily than flu and causes more serious illnesses in some people. It can also take longer before people show symptoms and people can be contagious for longer. More information about differences between flu and COVID-19 is available in the different sections below.

Because some of the symptoms of flu and COVID-19 are similar, it may be hard to tell the difference between them based on symptoms alone, and [testing](https://www.cdc.gov/flu/symptoms/testing.htm#anchor_1596736120603)may be needed to help confirm a diagnosis.

While more is learned every day about COVID-19 and the virus that causes it, there is still a lot that is unknown . This page compares COVID-19 and flu, given the best available information to date.
