Rapidly rising caseloads alarm researchers, who fear the virus may make its way across the globe. But scientists cannot yet predict how many deaths may result.

The [Wuhan coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/20/world/europe/coronavirus-lab-anthrax.html) spreading from [China](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/12/health/covid-lab-leak-who-china.html) is now likely to become a pandemic that circles the globe, according to many of the world’s leading infectious disease experts.

The prospect is daunting. A pandemic — an ongoing epidemic on two or more continents — may well have global consequences, despite the extraordinary travel restrictions and quarantines now imposed by [China](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/world/asia/japan-coronavirus-clusters.html) and other countries, including the United States.

Scientists do not yet know how lethal the new coronavirus is, however, so there is uncertainty about how much damage a pandemic might cause. But there is growing consensus that the pathogen is readily transmitted between humans.

The Wuhan coronavirus is spreading more like influenza, which is highly transmissible, than like its slow-moving viral cousins, SARS and MERS, scientists have found.

“It’s very, very transmissible, and it almost certainly is going to be a pandemic,” said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease.

“But will it be catastrophic? I don’t know.”

In the last three weeks, the number of lab-confirmed cases has soared from about 50 in China to more than [17,000 in at least 23 countries; there have been more than 360 deaths](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/02/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html).
