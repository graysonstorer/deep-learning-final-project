# SA opened its borders to COVID-19 this week. Here's what we've learned

South Australia this week went where no other state — possibly no other jurisdiction — has gone before.

Key points:
-----------

*   SA opened its borders to NSW, ACT and Victoria last Tuesday
*   As of Saturday, 10 positive cases had been recorded in interstate travellers
*   Close contacts of positive cases still need to quarantine

After enjoying months without a single case of local transmission, the state opened last Tuesday and allowed the virus into the community, with its vaccination rate sitting just shy of 80 per cent.

By comparison, Sydney celebrated its "Freedom Day" when 73 per cent of its population over 16 had received two jabs, while [England opened](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-07-20/how-uk-freedom-day-marks-end-of-covid-19-restrictions/100294668) in July with its double-dose vaccination rate at 68 per cent.

South Australian authorities are hoping they will be able to minimise the health impact from borders re-opening, but also want to teach the state how to live with COVID-19.

Almost a week into that plan, here is what we have learned so far.

There will be cases
-------------------

There were[jubilant scenes at Adelaide Airport on Tuesday](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-23/covid-19-roadmap-sees-sa-borders-reopen-to-vaccinated/100641626), as families and friends separated by border closures reunited.

Road travellers – either fully vaccinated, or with an exemption in hand — spilled into SA at midnight, desperate to spend time with loved ones.

Then, as if on cue, South Australia [recorded its first new case 24 hours later](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-24/sa-records-positive-covid19-cases-in-interstate-arrival/100645794).

A girl from Victoria, who was too young to be vaccinated, had travelled into the state to visit relatives.

She received a positive result after undergoing testing at Tailem Bend and returned to Victoria to isolate – leaving her grandparents in quarantine here for seven days, too.

Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier immediately declared the case a "wake-up call".

Several more cases from interstate travellers have since been recorded – [10 in total](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-27/south-australia-records-three-new-cases/100655814) as of this afternoon.

That is still a significant number for a state that is used to zero.

People still have to quarantine
-------------------------------

Though fully vaccinated travellers from across the country are now free to enter South Australia, this week has shown us that mandatory quarantine remains a necessary, albeit inconvenient, measure for now.

According to current directions, fully vaccinated close contacts of positive cases in SA need to quarantine for seven days, while unvaccinated close contacts must quarantine for 14 days.

The direction captured [all passengers aboard a Qantas flight deemed close contacts](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-25/sa-records-three-new-cases-of-covid-19/100651000), and several rows of passengers who had travelled on two other flights.

Presumably, some of those travellers had been looking forward to reunions of their own.

Anyone who bought a donut at the airport Wednesday mid-morning was also told to immediately get tested and isolate until they received a negative test result.

It seems a trip into South Australia could still [cost a traveller at least seven days in quarantine](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-25/sa-health-lists-new-exposure-sites-related-positive-covid-case/100648888), while picking up a sweet snack could land you in isolation for at least a day or two.

It is a stark reminder to those looking to come into South Australia in the lead up to Christmas, that "open borders" won't necessarily mean worry-free travel.

It's different for businesses this time – but they're still under pressure
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SA Health is still listing exposure sites according to risk.

But this time around, businesses impacted by positive cases won't have to close for deep cleaning, unless otherwise advised by SA Health.

That does not mean business owners and their staff will not have a lot to work through now that borders are open.

Business owners are grappling with how to manage potential exposure to the virus, and planning for the event that multiple staff may need to quarantine for up to 14 days if they are not vaccinated.

The state government has mandated vaccines for some industries, including health services, police, education, and taxi and rideshare services.

But Premier Steven Marshall has ruled out introducing a blanket approach – meaning it will be up to individual businesses as to whether they impose vaccine mandates for staff and customers.

Not all states and territories are on board
-------------------------------------------

While those in New South Wales, the ACT and Victoria are well accustomed to daily case numbers in the hundreds or thousands, Western Australia is holding off throwing its borders open until it hits its 90 per cent double-dose rate.

South Australia has acted as a buffer for WA throughout the pandemic, sometimes shielding the state from truck drivers and other travellers carrying the virus.

But WA Premier Mark McGowan[has warned his state will reintroduce border restrictions with South Australia,](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-25/chris-dawson-s-january-wa-border-opening-slip-up-/100650546) should WA health authorities recommend it.

On Friday, Mr McGowan said while South Australia chose to open its border before reaching an 80 per cent double vaccination rate, WA would remain "far more careful" and "cautious".

At the same time, the Northern Territory reintroduced testing requirements for those entering from South Australia.

South Australia's reopening has been joyous news for many, but some governments remain wary.

Authorities don't really know how this will play out
----------------------------------------------------

Modelling released in early November presented several scenarios.

The "best case" scenario suggests there's a [27 per cent chance of an outbreak within 300 days of borders opening](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-11-01/sa-releases-covid-19-modelling-ahead-of-border-reopening/100583828).

That scenario estimates several thousand cases and 13 deaths.

So will the modelling, and cases of community transmission, spur on more South Australians to get vaccinated, setting the state up for its long-term recovery?

Exactly a week before the border was due to open, 13,935 jabs were administered, compared with 15,612 on Tuesday – a difference of 1,677.

The Premier and Chief Public Health Officer have both predicted more people in the vaccine-hesitant camp will get their jabs once cases pop up in the community.

With Christmas and the "Mad March" festival season fast approaching – along with a federal and state election — any outbreak will have wide implications for the South Australian public and its leaders.

No one can predict exactly how it will all play out.

The strongest advice remains to simply to get vaccinated, and fast.

How is Australia in the grip of another COVID-19 wave?
