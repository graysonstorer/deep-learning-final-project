WA will drop mask requirements on all public and passenger transport from next Friday, September 9 as COVID-19 case numbers continue to drop.

Mask wearing will still be required for high-risk settings such as hospitals, prisons and aged and disability care facilities.

![Image 4: Masks will also not be required on interstate and intrastate flights. ](https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.128%2C$multiply_0.5855%2C$ratio_1.776846%2C$width_1059%2C$x_0%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/439c412e99d89765b910dfb9b7f37e3c58dcdb2e)

The government is continuing to encourage people to wear masks in crowded indoor settings when people can’t physically distance themselves from each other.

WA Health on Friday reported a total of 1200 new cases to 4pm Thursday night. There are currently 6661 active cases, 215 people with COVID-19 in hospital and six in ICU. Friday’s report included 13 deaths, dating back to 12 June, reported to WA Health on Thursday – a woman aged over 100, four women and a man in their 90s, four women and two men in their 80s and a man in his 70s.

[In line with the national cabinet’s decisions](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/covid-19-isolation-reduced-to-five-days-masks-on-planes-scrapped-20220831-p5bean.html), also effective from next Friday, isolation requirements for COVID-19 positive cases and close contacts of COVID-19 positive cases will be reduced from seven days to five, providing people have no symptoms.

Staff, patients and visitors may only enter high risk facilities including hospitals, residential aged care facilities and disability support accommodation facilities if it has been seven days since they were identified as a case or a close contact.

As always, people should stay home if unwell, if if they’re testing negative, and if they have been in isolation for COVID-19, only leave it once all symptoms have cleared.

Visitation limits will also be eased for residential aged and disability care facilities.

From Friday, September 2, these facilities will be able to determine for themselves the number of visitors permitted per resident each day.

Proof of vaccination will also still be required for aged care facilities.

Testing and isolating early is the most effective way to limit the spread of COVID-19 and free RATs can be easily accessed. Visit [wa.gov.au](http://wa.gov.au/) for more information.

“These changing protocols follow the latest public health advice, however it’s important we all remain vigilant and remember the basic public health behaviours,” Premier Mark McGowan said in a statement.

“We are not out of this pandemic yet, and if necessary we will reintroduce public health measures if circumstances change.”

The mask mandate relaxation includes all interstate and intrastate aircraft, public transport and rideshare.

The announcement follows the health department [further winding back public COVID-19 clinics](https://www.watoday.com.au/national/western-australia/wa-covid-clinics-wound-back-further-as-national-cabinet-mulls-isolation-cut-20220830-p5be2k.html) on the back of declining case numbers and low demand for PCR tests.

The department announced on Tuesday that opening hours at the Royal Perth, Joondalup and Rockingham hospitals and PathWest Murdoch clinics would drop to 8am-4pm from the start of September. Private clinics will need a GP’s referral for PCR tests from October 1.

Each household can pick up 20 rapid antigen tests from drive-through collection points in the metro area.

The national cabinet left undecided the fate of the $750 disaster leave payments available to support people who cannot work while in isolation.

The payments were extended by the federal government in July but are due to expire at the end of September. National cabinet will meet again in a fortnight to discuss what will happen beyond that.

Services Australia will update its website by the end of Friday with the new eligibility rules for the leave payments to reflect the changes starting on September 9. The government is still considering whether the payment amount will drop from $750 to reflect the shorter time in isolation.

People who work in high-risk settings such as aged care or disability care will still have the week-long isolation requirement.
