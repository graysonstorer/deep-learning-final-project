COVID-19 Cases, World
---------------------

WHO will utilize various sources to continue monitoring the COVID-19 epidemiological situation via the WHO COVID-19 dashboard. If data for certain countries is unavailable in this section, it may indicate that they have either ceased reporting COVID-19 surveillance data to WHO or have integrated the COVID-19 surveillance into existing respiratory disease surveillance. In the latter case, SARS-CoV-2 detections from sentinel and systematic virological surveillance sites in those countries may be found in the Circulation section which also includes information on SARS-CoV-2 variant circulation. This global summary of COVID-19 cases includes data on confirmed cases reported to WHO from the comprehensive COVID-19 case monitoring.

 What is the definition of 'confirmed' and 'reported' in COVID-19 data? 
All data represents the date of reporting as opposed to date of symptom onset. All data is subject to continuous verification and may change based on retrospective updates to accurately reflect trends, changes in country case definitions and/or reporting practices. Significant data errors detected or reported to WHO may be corrected at more frequent intervals with some countries performing retrospective bulk corrections may lead to the appearance of significant spikes or negative values which are verified and validated by WHO.

In the context of WHO's statistical reporting of COVID-19 data, it is important to note that only confirmed cases are included in case and death counts. In guidance updated on 22 July 2023; there are two alternative definitions for 'Confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection' in international surveillance reporting, although some departures may exist due to local adaptations:

a) A person with a positive Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT), regardless of clinical criteria OR epidemiological criteria.

b) A person meeting clinical criteria AND/OR epidemiological criteria (suspect case A) with a positive professional-use or self-test SARS-CoV-2 Antigen-RDT.

Additionally, WHO only disseminates data as reported by its Member States. From the 31 December 2019 to the 21 March 2020, WHO collected the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths through official communications under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), complemented by monitoring the official ministries of health websites and social media accounts.

Since 22 March 2020, global data has been compiled through WHO region-specific dashboards, and/or aggregate count data reported directly to WHO headquarters by Member States. Statistical counts include both domestic and repatriated cases. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times (e.g. time to case notification, and time to reporting of deaths) differ between countries, territories and areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented with variable under or overestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these statistics at a global level. Please note that statistics do not necessarily reflect the actual number of cases and deaths or the actual number of countries where cases and deaths are occurring, as a number of countries have stopped reporting or changed their frequency of reporting.

 Why is COVID-19 data being presented as weekly statistics? 
A number of countries have stopped reporting or changed their frequency of reporting COVID-19 case and death counts to WHO. An outcome of these differences in reporting is that WHO may receive daily data from some countries, while other countries may only report data to WHO once every 14 days. In addition, countries differ in how they choose to report statistics; some countries provide their data attributed to specific dates while others who report less frequently may group data from 7 days into a single statistic attributed to a week in their reporting.As of 25 August 2023, WHO declared that it is no longer necessary for Member States to report daily counts of cases and deaths to WHO and requested strengthening of weekly reporting.

**Reported data is still available attributed to specific dates (daily data)[here as a download](https://data.who.int/dashboards/covid19/data).**This dashboard presents the same statistics as weekly figures in charts in order to mitigate against the visual misinterpretation of data. Should daily data have been presented here, many countries would show zero counts for multiple consecutive days due in part to the differences in how they choose to report. While weekly intervals do not completely mitigate against this, the approach reduces the risk that some dashboard users might infer zero cases or deaths when lack of data is often due to reporting differences.

**What do negative counts of cases or deaths mean?** All data is subject to continuous verification and may change based on retrospective updates to accurately reflect trends, changes in country case definitions and/or reporting practices. Significant data errors detected or reported to WHO may be corrected by Member States at more frequent intervals with some countries performing retrospective bulk corrections in their reporting. Bulk corrections may lead to the appearance of significant spikes or negative values which are verified and validated by WHO.

### Glossary and definitions

| Confirmed COVID-19 case | Although COVID-19 defines the symptomatic disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, the cases are presented in this dashboard meet one of two alternate definitions of confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in international surveillance reporting: a) A person with a positive Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT), regardless of clinical criteria* OR epidemiological criteria*. b) A person meeting clinical criteria* AND/OR epidemiological criteria* (suspect case A) with a positive professional-use or self-test SARS-CoV-2 Antigen-RDT. *Please visit the [WHO COVID-19 Case definition](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-2019-nCoV-Surveillance_Case_Definition-2022.1) for details on clinical and epidemiological criteria. _Updated 22 July 2023_ |
| --- |
| Last 7 days | ‘Last 7 days’ refers to the most recent complete epidemiological week (commonly referred to as an 'epi week'). |
| Last 28 days | ‘Last 28 days’ refers to the four preceding most recently complete epidemiological weeks. |
| WHO Regions | The World Health Organization (WHO) is divided into six regions with regional offices, each responsible for addressing health challenges and promoting public health within its designated geographical area. These regions serve as administrative units that allow the WHO to tailor its efforts to the specific needs, priorities, and health conditions of member countries within each region. |
| World Bank Income Groups | The World Bank classifies economies into income groups based on their Gross National Income (GNI) per capita. These annually updated classifications help the World Bank and other organizations analyze and understand global economic trends, allocate resources, and design development policies. |

### Data sources

| COVID-19 case data | From the 31 December 2019 to the 21 March 2020, WHO collected the numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths through official communications under the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), complemented by monitoring the official ministries of health websites and social media accounts. Since 22 March 2020, global data is compiled through WHO region-specific dashboards, and/or aggregate count data reported to WHO headquarters. WHO COVID-19 Dashboard is updated every Tuesday for the period of two full weeks prior. Counts primarily reflect laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths, based upon WHO case definitions; although some departures may exist due to local adaptations. Counts include both domestic and repatriated cases. Case detection, definitions, testing strategies, reporting practice, and lag times (e.g. time to case notification, and time to reporting of deaths) differ between countries, territories and areas. These factors, amongst others, influence the counts presented with variable under or overestimation of true case and death counts, and variable delays to reflecting these data at a global level. All data represent date of reporting as opposed to date of symptom onset. All data are subject to continuous verification and may change based on retrospective updates to accurately reflect trends, changes in country case definitions and/or reporting practices. Significant data errors detected or reported to WHO may be corrected at more frequent intervals. **New case and death counts from the Region of the Americas** Starting from the week commencing on 11 September 2023, the source of the data from the Region of the Americas was switched to the aggregated national surveillances, received through the COVID-19, Influenza, RSV and Other Respiratory Viruses program in the Americas. Data have been included retrospectively since 31 July 2023. **Rates** <0.001 per 100,000 population may be rounded to 0. |
