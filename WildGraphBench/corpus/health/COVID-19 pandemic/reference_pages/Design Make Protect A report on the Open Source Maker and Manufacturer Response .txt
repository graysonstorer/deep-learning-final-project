We’d like to thank the following people and organizations, without whom this report would not have been possible. We would have had nothing to write without the willingness of individual responders to take the time to share their stories with us. The hundreds of individual makers and local response groups who filled out our surveys and weekly tallies and the health care professionals who took time out of their busy schedules to grant us interviews are all individually listed in the back of this report. We’re grateful as well to Sherry Lassiter, Rebecca Ottinger and the other folks at the Fab Foundation, who were generous enough to share data sets with us so we could build a more comprehensive picture of this global response. Our thanks also go out to the volunteer translators and Project Managers at Translation Commons, who made it possible for us to incorporate data from non-English speakers. We couldn’t have completed this monumental piece of work without the support of Schmidt Futures, the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation, the Toyota Research Institute, the Harry Merlo Foundation, and other OSMS partners. Additionally, we thank Google, Chevron, Nation of Makers’ partners and the membership of Nation of Makers for their support that enabled this work to occur. And finally, there would have been nothing to write about if makers and health care workers hadn’t chosen to step up and take initiative when the pandemic began. We are humbled and honored by the sacrifices and contributions of the hundreds of thousands of individuals around the globe who tried to do something to keep this disease from spreading and from taking lives. 

This report is dedicated to you.

# How Communities of Open Source Innovators Responded to COVID-19 Medical Supply Shortages 

# Summary 

As COVID-19 spread around the globe in early 2020, the world experienced a concurrent medical supply chain failure that resulted in widespread shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical supplies. Existing medical supply manufacturing and distribution systems were slow to respond to the exponentially-growing global demand for supplies, leaving healthcare systems, essential service providers, and others without the supplies they needed to prevent infection. Word about these widespread shortages spread via news media and social networks and citizens around the world stepped up to design, produce, and distribute PPE and other medical supplies for their local communities. Over the course of 8 months, an international community of makers, hackers, crafters, DIY-ers, and small-to-medium scale manufacturers were called into action by their peers, community partners, and healthcare workers. True to the “open source” 2 spirit, they shared design files and specifications, production plans, best practices, and resources. Together they produced over 

48 million units of personal protective equipment and medical supplies in 86 countries .These emergency responders labored with little or no compensation, often receiving donations of raw materials or raising their own funds via crowdsourcing to produce supplies. Open Source Medical Supplies (OSMS) began tallying how many supplies open source communities were producing every week, starting in March 2020, in order to capture this bottom-up response. OSMS then partnered with Nation of Makers (NoM) to issue a Community Impact Survey in Fall 2020 in order to gather comprehensive data and distill lessons learned from this open source response. The quantitative findings in this report are a combination of these two datasets and a survey that Fab Foundation sent to the Fab Lab Network. The qualitative narrative is derived from the Community Impact Survey and interviews with key individuals from within the Citizen Maker Response.

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 7Our data indicates that the key factors that enabled diverse supply designs, large production volumes, and rapidity of the maker response include: 

● Global distribution of community networks; both pre-existing and those established in the wake of pandemic response 

● Widespread access to digital fabrication toolsets and an orientation towards rapid prototyping processes 

● Collaboration with clinicians and medical institutions 

● Vast adoption of a small number of curated online forums for free and fast information exchange 

● Open source validated medical supply designs and production guides 

● Hyperlocal funding support and a willingness to volunteer 

● Retooled manufacturers leveraging new open source designs to scale production quickly 

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT outlines the global issues that resulted from how our existing medical supply chain was affected by the spread of COVID-19; how citizens were compelled to respond and help their local communities as they experienced shortages; what supplies they made and how they made them; how those responses evolved over the course of the pandemic; and what can be done from a policy perspective to align, formalize and properly support a distributed volunteer manufacturing response to crises in order to build local and global resilience against future challenges. While the OSMS Weekly Tally and Community Impact Survey results did not capture the entirety of the global open source maker response, the data does have a significant reach across the landscape of response and provides a multi-faceted view into this unique phenomenon. 

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT report partners focused their key insights and recommendations for a U.S. audience, though lessons may be applicable globally. 

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 8Survey Methodology 

Open Source Medical Supplies (OSMS) was founded in March of 2020 to provide open source plans for makers to produce medical supplies for their local communities. Nation of Makers (NoM) is a national non-profit established in 2016 to support maker organizations (makerspaces, maker events, and other organizations that support and affiliate with the maker community) through community building, resource sharing, and advocacy. OSMS and NoM worked together to instigate, guide, and survey the open source citizen response, and then compiled their findings into this report. From March to August 2020, OSMS manually surveyed production data on a weekly basis via self-reported “Weekly Tally” posts to its 70,000-person Facebook group. 3 Public Facebook posts were used to keep a transparent record of hundreds of respondents each week. Community members were encouraged to post weekly numbers, production locations, and group affiliations. Large reports were further verified through clarifications on the tallies, individual conversations, and photo evidence. In September 2020, OSMS and NoM compiled a Community Impact Survey 4 to capture final production numbers and more information from the citizen responders in their online networks, with the goal of producing this report detailing their efforts. Data from a survey issued by the Fab Foundation to its network of Fab Labs throughout the U.S. and the world in Fall 2020 was additionally integrated into the dataset. Together, these surveys represent 1,878 individuals and groups , of which 1,336 (71.1%) are U.S.-based. The groups collectively represent a minimum of 42,000 volunteers and staff .The responding groups are present in 86 countries and all 50 U.S. states (plus Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia). This collection of data revealed that between March and November of 2020, this distributed open source community of makers around the world produced, at minimum, 48.3 million units of medical supplies with an estimated market value of over $271M (USD) . Over the same period, U.S. groups alone reported over 34 million units produced and distributed, with an estimated market value of over $163M. 

Due to the voluntary nature of the collected responses, the authors believe this data represents only a portion of non-traditional medical supply production —the actual count is likely much greater. As an example, this data does not include data from the JOANN chain of fabric and craft stores’ Create to Give response, through which customers produced over 400 million cloth masks in the U.S. alone, 5 other maker-manufacturer networks such as

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 10 The Problem 

On January 11th, 2020, China reported its first death from the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus in Wuhan. By January 21st, the virus had been detected in Japan, South Korea, Thailand, and the United States. 10 By February 15th, China had placed over 760 million people under residential lockdowns of varying severities in an attempt to control the spread of the virus, thus temporarily halting production within thousands of manufacturing facilities across the country for a month or longer. 11 The U.S. began experiencing shortages of necessary medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) almost immediately after Chinese manufacturing shut down. By March 18th, healthcare workers from Providence St. Joseph Hospital in Washington State were creating improvised PPE out of office supplies in conference rooms, and nurses were soliciting donations of N95s and other protective equipment through Facebook. 12 

As of mid-January, 2021, SARS-CoV-2 has infected 96.2M people worldwide and killed 2.06M. Included in those totals are 24.5M Americans who have been infected, and over 406,000 who have died from the virus. It has continued wreaking havoc across the global supply chain, and medical supplies are once again difficult to source. 

# Just-In-Time Global Supply Chain 

Over the past 20 years, hospitals and healthcare facilities across the United States have adopted cost-cutting, just-in-time inventory management practices that rely on fast shipping of newly-manufactured medical supplies for replenishment. According to Michael Osterholm, Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, “Most if not all of the medical products or protective-device companies in this country are operating at almost full capacity. That’s the reality of today’s economy; just-in-time delivery with no surge capacity.” This practice is fundamentally at odds with the “just-in-case” stockpiling of supplies for emergencies and is known to leave the U.S. vulnerable during epidemics and pandemics. These just-in-time inventory management practices rely on a significant percentage of medical protective equipment and supplies being manufactured abroad. As of 2018, China produced 43% of the world’s just-in-time imports of medical personal protective equipment (PPE), including face shields, protective garments, masks, and goggles. Specifically, China provides 70% of the mouth-nose protection equipment the U.S. consumes. 13

# Supply Chain Disruption 

The temporary closing of Chinese manufacturing due to COVID-19 residential lockdowns created shortages of medical supplies across the globe. The U.S. experienced critical shortages of PPE and other supplies immediately and has since experienced additional shortages that correlate with surges of viral activity across different regions. This combination of factors creates preventable, recurring supply shortages that needlessly endanger healthcare workers, essential workers, and the general public throughout this pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that these recurring yet predictable shortages are caused by the combination of our dependence on centralized offshore manufacturing, our reliance on fragile just-in-time global medical supply chains, a lack of a stockpile of critical supplies and protective equipment, and the inequitable distribution of the existing supply chain. 

A global “demand shock” of governments and healthcare systems panic-buying PPE 15 sent prices skyrocketing and turned a just-in-time industry 16 of PPE supplies with a short ordering horizon into a government-hoarding demand surge. Additionally, 80+ countries placed export restrictions on medical supplies and PPE during this surge, including China—which, at that time, produced 50% of the world’s face masks. 17 

The compounding effect of the exponential spread of COVID-19 and the proportional increase in the actual monthly need for PPE multiplied the effect of panic buying stockpiles. The OECD

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 12 estimates that the demand increase for surgical masks was ten times higher than the prior global production capacity. 18 

One well-known issue with widespread pandemics is their significant effect on international logistics. Once COVID-19 was declared to be a global pandemic, commercial air traffic came to a halt. Domestic U.S. airlines cut commercial flights by as much as 90% year-over-year (YoY) in the first few months. 19 This immediately impacted available air cargo capacity, as 50% of the world’s air freight travels via commercial airlines. Eventually, airlines began putting freight in passenger seats or stripping seats from commercial passenger aircraft, in order to transport more cargo. 20 

Bottlenecks in exports of air cargo became so substantial at Shanghai Pudong International Airport that commercial truck drivers waited in lines for days to deliver truckloads. Parcels then waited weeks to be loaded onto aircraft and aircraft were turned away without cargo because inspections were not completed in time for scheduled departures. 21 Ocean freight, which was also disrupted at the start of the pandemic when Wuhan was quarantined, faced similar logistical issues. The cost of shipping via ocean freight is now 300% more expensive than pre-pandemic levels, with container berths sold out for months. 22 Manufacturers cannot currently ship new products internationally in significant volumes if they have not already purchased cargo space. 23 

# A Nation Left Vulnerable 

On March 4th, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported that the Strategic National Stockpile held only 1% of the face masks necessary to address a “full-blown” coronavirus pandemic. Only 12 million medical-grade N95 masks and 30 million surgical face masks were in the stockpile, but 3.5 billion were necessary. 24 This failure to stockpile sufficient supplies, alongside hospital and faulty healthcare facility inventory practices requiring a functional and timely supply chain, meant that healthcare systems ran out of many critical medical supplies within weeks of the pandemic reaching the U.S.

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 13 Given the extraordinarily high demand for N95 masks and the HHS-identified need for 3.5 billion of them, 3M increased its production by 42% (from 35 million to 50 million per month) between March and July 2020, but was unable to rapidly scale further due to the centralized manufacturing processes integrated into the production of this crucial item. 25 Importantly, demand during emergencies is not an automatic driver of increased production. U.S.-based surgical mask manufacturers balked at investing in production increases at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic because they had invested heavily in infrastructure during previous pandemics at significant cost. Hospitals then reverted to purchasing cheaper foreign-made masks once prior pandemics were over, and the manufacturers had to furlough employees and sell off infrastructure. 26 

Offshore manufacturing of medical supplies and protective equipment leads to potential national security issues if countries begin restricting exports or stockpiling goods to meet the demands within their own borders. In April, China introduced drastic export restrictions, and the U.S. Department of State announced that China had nationalized its medical supply manufacturers in the midst of the U.S.’ first significant surge. 27 American companies were unable to import purchased, manufactured supplies from their own Chinese subsidiaries. At least 69 countries would eventually restrict or ban the export of protective equipment, medical devices, or medicines during the pandemic. 28 

Compounding the effect of Chinese export restrictions, U.S. regulators required significant inspection and certification procedures of supplies sold to US entities due, in part, to a deluge of fraudulent and counterfeit medical supplies sold throughout the U.S. Many supplies sat on loading docks for multiple weeks before the crisis lessened. These policies directly endangered healthcare and essential workers in the U.S. while they were already facing supply shortages. 29 

# Dramatic Cost Increases 

During supply shortages, customers capable of placing larger orders, such as primary regional hospital systems, are favored by existing manufacturers, and smaller secondary care facilities, such as nursing homes, homeless shelters, physician’s offices, and others, cannot compete in

A survey conducted by Get Us PPE in September of 2020 reported that 80% of small U.S. facilities requesting their aid had no available stock of at least one type of PPE. N95s, disinfecting wipes, and surgical masks remained in very short supply despite manufacturers having six months to scale production. 30 Further, markups during the pandemic drove prices up between 100% and 1,000%, creating a shortage and distribution challenge on a global level while magnifying issues around a lack of stockpiling.

# Healthcare Workers in Peril 

Healthcare workers rely on PPE to protect not only themselves but those in their communities. 32 

Without adequate PPE, a healthcare worker is more likely to be exposed to infectious materials or body fluids and therefore more likely to become ill and then transmit the infection within their community. 33 With the supply chain interrupted, healthcare workers were losing their ability to safely treat patients and were resorting to measures such as reusing masks and wearing trash bags in a desperate attempt to protect themselves on the front lines.

“As we sit here today, I'm still not able to get more than a few days' supply of N95 masks, and I still struggle to a certain extent with gowns. That doesn't make you sleep at night, because you're not sure when the next delivery comes." 38

Source: New York Post 35 “The coronavirus outbreak is bending Boston's health care system, and the president of one of its top hospitals is asking for help, even from people with 3D printers. Supplies are on the "low side" at Massachusetts General Hospital, and conservation alone will not do the trick, said the hospital's president, Dr. Peter Slavin. "We have vast numbers of 3D printers in this country," he said. "The formula for producing these masks is available online for free. I would hope companies across the country would, who would have that capability, would start making masks later this afternoon.” 39 - Perry Russom, Reporter, Boston, Massachusetts, United States 

A recent study by the Massachusetts General Hospital in the Lancet demonstrated that healthcare workers that reused PPE were 46% more likely to contract COVID-19, compared to those that had an adequate supply. 40 In addition to PPE for healthcare and essential workers, studies in leading medical journals conclusively determined that widespread public use of non-medical face coverings is the primary determinant of reducing COVID-19 transmission. This created a demand for hundreds of millions of non-medical face masks in the United States. 41 

As the availability of medical supplies diminished, demand signals became more public. Social media platforms and community forums started to populate with public requests for PPE from clinicians and first responders. Doctors and other healthcare workers began risking reprimand and, in some cases, their careers 42 by asking the public for help sourcing and manufacturing PPE, defying gag orders placed by their medical institutions. 43 Concerns about shortages of medical devices like ventilators also received mainstream media coverage. Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York detailed his state’s experience trying to source ventilators, telling CNN’s Anderson Cooper, “This state had purchased 17,000 ventilators, more than any other state in the nation, and they never got delivered. Because they were all coming from China, and 50 states are competing...we can't get any more.” 44

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 17 The Citizen Maker Response 

As COVID-19 spread across the world, news media began describing hospital administrators making PPE out of office supplies due to widespread medical supply shortages. 45 Designers and engineers felt compelled to address the challenges that arose early in the pandemic and began voluntarily designing open source solutions that could be made by volunteer fabricators. These designers and engineers sought feedback from clinicians and other makers, pursued distribution platforms for their ideas, and quickly joined or formed online communities. These networks developed production lines, labeling and packaging procedures, and distribution efforts. For the purposes of this report, we define these responders as any citizen, citizen group, or small-to-medium size retooled manufacturer that produced personal protective equipment or medical supplies during the COVID-19 pandemic , whether or not they identify with the terminology “maker”, “crafter”, “DIY” or other terminology typically used to describe the maker community. In this report, we refer to this community collectively as the Citizen Maker Response. 

This Citizen Maker Response was comprised of commercial, community, academia, K-12 students, and hobbyist makers, tinkerers, hackers, clinicians, crafters, designers, sewists, artisans, builders, prototypers, small-batch manufacturers, DIY-enthusiasts, and others with skills and experience in electronics design, textiles, 3D printing, CNC fabrication, woodworking, metalworks, arts and crafts, and other forms of small-scale design, prototyping and fabrication. Very few of the individuals, groups, and businesses participating in this response had any experience producing medical supplies before the pandemic. The vast majority (94%, according to survey data) volunteered their labor. 

Globally, the Citizen Maker Response produced at least 48,392,965 units of medical supplies in response to pandemic-induced supply shortages, a production output that rivals large, centralized PPE manufacturers. Of that, U.S. maker responders manufactured at least 34,225,081 units of medical supplies with an estimated market value of over $160M .

# Pre-Existing Conditions 

Over the last 15 years, significant consumer interest and rapid industry development cycles have led to dramatic price reductions in digital manufacturing equipment like 3D printers and laser cutters. Mechanical design software has become increasingly more affordable as major computer-aided design (CAD) software developers began targeting hobbyists, DIY enthusiasts, and small manufacturers. This combination of factors has led to widespread “democratization” of design and manufacturing resources that allow any hobbyist to own and operate a small, digitally-connected factory within their home. These resources have also made their way into shared facilities for those unable to afford their own equipment. A vast international network of thousands of makerspaces, 46 Fab Labs, 47 

hackerspaces, 48 media labs, 49 and other crafting and manufacturing hubs exist to offer shared use of prototyping and digital fabrication equipment while cultivating and supporting member communities trained in design and fabrication. These spaces typically offer a diverse assortment of materials and resources on-hand that can help bring a concept or idea to life, from sketch through design development, and have the equipment to print, build or program prototypes and final products in small-to-midsize batches. 50 For the purposes of this report, these spaces are all referred to as makerspaces. 

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of these makerspaces and their members were loosely connected via social media, mailing lists, and recurring events such as Maker Faire. Members often joined and participated in international online communities around their shared interests, such as 3D printing, crafting and sewing, specific fabrication-related hobbies, and manufacturing. These online communities also include tens of thousands of individuals who do not hold makerspace memberships but own personal fabrication equipment and share similar interests. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, this pre-existing global network of makerspaces and interested individuals shared information about the pandemic and how citizen fabrication could help within a matter of hours to days—far faster than local and national governments were willing to relay such information to the public. This global network also allowed different regions and countries to prepare volunteer and production efforts before COVID-19 infections surged in their areas.

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 19 Types of Supplies Produced 

Makers around the globe were able to design and manufacture, from scratch, almost every type of infection-preventing PPE and a significant number of medical devices used to identify and treat COVID-19. While design and production were dominated by face shields (52.0%), disposable hospital gowns (15.8%), and cloth masks (12.2%), they also included novel devices such as ear savers that prevented N95 and surgical masks from aggravating the wearer’s skin; high-performance ICU PPE such as PAPR/CAPR helmets and suits; consumables such as hand sanitizer, gloves and nasal swabs; infrastructures such as handwashing station; and complicated medical devices such as stethoscopes and ventilators.

# Face Shields (25M) 

Face shields proved to be an ideal product for distributed production by digital fabrication enthusiasts. Locally-manufactured face shields were a welcome additional solution for eye protection and extending the life of increasingly rare hospital-grade surgical masks and N95 respirators by preventing exterior droplet accumulation. The frame headbands could be easily 3D-printed by individuals at home, cut quickly via laser cutter, or made en masse via injection molding. The transparent plastic shields could, at the most basic level, be made from materials like office supply vinyl with scissors, and could be scaled up with laser cutting and die-cutting. DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 20 Protective Gowns (8M) 

Isolation gowns, worn over clothing to protect against contamination from viral particles, were in short supply within the first few months of the pandemic. Healthcare workers expressed an urgent need to the maker community for gowns, and a number of makerspaces and production groups pivoted to manufacture them. Most isolation gowns are made by ultrasonic or thermal welding, which requires tools not typically present in most manufacturing facilities. Both makerspaces and retooled manufacturers purchased or made new infrastructure in order to produce gowns, and in large enough quantities for gowns to be the second-most produced item. 

# Cloth Masks (6M) 

Widespread cloth mask usage in public spaces was suggested by the CDC one month into the pandemic in order to reduce community transmission. Cloth masks are used to help mitigate spread from sick individuals to healthy individuals, for covering vented filtering masks, and to protect N95 masks from viral contamination. While cloth masks rank third in the OSMS survey data, the U.S. fabric supply store chain JOANN reported that its customers manufactured 400 million masks 51 alone, suggesting a significant underreporting of the magnitude of total cloth mask production. Cloth mask production is possible in isolation, and like face shields, continues to be produced across distributed networks of makers and crafters for donation to local communities. While generally produced for non-medical environments, healthcare workers have leveraged locally produced cloth masks when disposable surgical masks have not been available, and often use them to reduce contamination of N95 filtering masks. 

# Other Supplies, Devices, and Services 

Other types of PPE and medical supplies were also developed and produced in order to address spot shortages in specific locations. Some examples include: 

● Wearable PPE, such as shoe covers and surgical caps , were produced by sewists when local hospitals put out calls for them. 

● Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPR) , high-performance medical devices that actively filter incoming air and blow it onto wearers’ faces, were repaired, reverse-engineered, or otherwise invented from scratch by a number of maker groups. 

● Multiple positive-pressure inflatable suits were reverse-engineered and manufactured by a number of makers for specific hospital systems in need. 

● Distilleries around the U.S. and world converted their ethanol production to 

hand sanitizer and other groups produced hand soap.  

> 51 “Create to Give: Donate Face Masks to Medical Personnel & More and More,” JOANN, accessed January 18, 2021, https://www.joann.com/make-to-give-response/.

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 21 ● Several types of emergency-use ventilators were designed and manufactured by groups across the world, with several meeting regulatory standards, including U.S. Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) standards and European Union regulations. Some maker responders also focused specifically on repairing medical and manufacturing equipment, such as Fixit Clinic, an organization dedicated to hosting pop-up workshops that teach the value of fixing items rather than discarding them and buying something new. 52 

Other organizations, such as Bellingham Makerspace in Bellingham, Washington, produced over 36,000 cloth masks and 3,700 face shields and also dedicated time and resources to repairing sewing machines and sharpening scissors for community sewists in need of those services. Something Labs in San Francisco, California repaired 136 PAPR devices and fabricated 13,658 PAPR tabs. 

# Novel Medical Supplies 

In addition to standard medical supply items, a number of new PPE types, medical supplies, and community-supportive infrastructure and tooling were invented and produced by citizen responders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

● Ear savers —thin straps with hooks or buttons that secure mask ear loops to the back of the wearer’s heads—were invented in response to healthcare workers’ calls for help as ear loops chafed their skin after wearing disposable masks for 12 or more hours a day. 

● Noninvasive ventilation helmets were developed to supply pressurized oxygen to patients without having to risk esophageal or lung damage from intubation procedures. 

● Ventilator splitters were developed so that a single ventilator could be used to support multiple patients as ventilator shortages were experienced across the world. 

● Door openers were developed to allow people to open publicly-used doors without touching handles or other surfaces with their hands. Many also included features that would allow a user to pick up handled items, such as grocery bags, without touching them directly, thereby reducing transmission risk. 

● Handwashing stations were developed to allow communities without access to running water to wash their hands. 

● Mask variations like windowed masks , with transparent partitions over the mouth to allow people to read the wearer’s lips as they speak, were developed for communities in need of this customization, such as the deaf and hard-of-hearing. 

● Makers with 3D printers even invented community-supportive tooling like automatic bias tape folders and mask pleaters for sewists in order to improve their production output by orders of magnitude.

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 22 Additionally, the COVID-19 Challenge, launched by Challenge America and the Veterans Health Administration Innovation Ecosystem, supported by America Makes, 53 spurred the creation of over 45 innovative solutions to problems raised by healthcare workers, ranging from UV sanitizers to protective barriers to nebulizer filtration systems. (See “Crowdsourcing Innovation through Challenges”). 

# Challenges of Making Regulated Supplies 

In almost all countries, the production of medical supplies is highly controlled and regulated in order to ensure the health and safety of patients and healthcare workers. The United States, for example, categorizes medical supplies into three classes via the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), ranging from low-risk, easily-manufacturable devices like bandages (Class I) to moderate-risk items such as surgical gloves and syringes (Class II) to high-risk life-sustaining items such as pacemakers (Class III). 

The FDA does not approve a manufacturer’s design, so that it may be produced by anyone; rather, it inspects and approves a manufacturing facility and manufacturing process that produces the final product. 54 Obtaining FDA approval to produce Class III medical devices can take 3 to 7 years from application to approval, on average, and the costs to a manufacturer can be significant. 55

Source: Anh Le Class I and Class II supplies and devices are generally less complex, but the time and financial commitment needed for regulatory clearances are still a significant barrier to entry for independent product developers. Medical institutions, labor unions, and others rely on FDA standards to clarify the liability landscape and ensure adequate protection of the labor force and patients, and therefore FDA approval is typically required for every medical supply item used in hospitals. When the FDA-approved supply chain fails, medical institutions then look to the FDA for clarification on how to procure supplies. When the pandemic arrived in the U.S. in March 2020, these clarifications took the form of Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs). 56 

The first FDA Authorization for PPE to help fight COVID-19 was granted on April 9, 2020 (with updates on April 13, 2020), for local production of face shields. 57 This EUA clarified critical standards for production and labeling for citizen responders, requiring things like labels that indicate what materials touch the skin. The EUA also clarified that hospitals could accept face shields, as long as chosen manufacturers complied with the articulated guidance on labeling and design, opening the door for hospitals and other medical institutions to accept supplies from the maker community. Though helpful, by the time the face shield EUA was released, U.S. makers had already produced over 739,000 face shields without authorization, and over 3.25 million had been produced globally. Makers took on the liability of producing these unauthorized products due to the sheer unmet need in the medical community. These face shields were designed, manufactured, and distributed by the maker community based on volunteer effort and local clinical guidance instead of centralized FDA guidance. As an example, a volunteer from Florida stated the following: 

“We started calling the healthcare providers in our area to determine the real needs... most of them didn't want to talk to us, didn't know how to talk to us, or wouldn't even answer the call. We were fortunate to connect with a contact at Orlando Health, a local nonprofit hospital organization here in Orlando. And not only were they willing to talk to us, they had taken someone from their team who's normally on innovation

projects and asked her to be the liaison. She was the perfect contact as her job is cutting through hospital bureaucracy. In the early days we were on the phone almost constantly. We built a 3D printing network with them, which included a document written for makers that clearly explained what they would accept and what they would not accept. It included links to the 3D printed models, instructions, and directions for drop off at their facility.” — Ian Cole, OSCMS Central and South Florida and Maker Effect Foundation, Miami, Florida, United States 

There were a number of other challenges the Citizen Maker Response experienced which were associated with the production of regulated supplies: 

● There was no pre-existing collection of open source, approved emergency medical supply designs. Almost all open source medical supply designs were developed during the pandemic itself. 

● Most existing clinical guidance and resources were inaccessible to laymen, as medical documentation and FDA guidance are intended for professional commercial medical suppliers. 

● Liability for supplies produced was extremely unclear, even though the vast majority of producers were manufacturing low-risk (Class I) supplies. 

● Very few new supply designs could be sufficiently tested for efficacy, as testing labs were overwhelmed from the start of the pandemic and charged significant fees. 

● Hospital supply chains are often contractually restricted to relatively few suppliers, and it is difficult for them to accept new supply sources, even if approved by the FDA via EUA. Even with these numerous regulatory challenges, makers that pivoted to become emergency manufacturers were able to produce tens of millions of units of supplies that were primarily distributed to hospital systems and medical practitioners. These distributions were made in times of crisis, with the sheer need for supplies overriding anxiety about liability and potential litigation, and could have been much smoother had more guidance or preemptively-approved crisis designs been available. 

# Developing Open Source Solutions 

Maker responders were determined to help their communities weather pandemic-induced shortages despite the regulatory hurdles involved in producing medical supplies. While the open source hardware movement has existed for over 15 years (due in large part to the growing popularity of consumer 3D printers), the community had generally not developed medical supply designs because there had never been a pressing need. Given the global scale of the pandemic, and the corresponding global scale of medical supply shortages, the international open source community quickly came together to rapidly design open source PPE and medical supplies in ways it never had before. DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 25 Traditional design and engineering processes are “closed source”—their outputs are considered the intellectual property of companies that pay the teams of designers and engineers. While effective and profitable over the long term, this type of development can be slow and limited, as each team working on a solution has to conduct its own user research, develop its own project requirements, iterate on designs and prototypes, and develop its own designs for specific manufacturing processes. By contrast, open source design and engineering processes can happen incredibly quickly, as entire communities of hundreds of thousands of people can contribute to shared understandings of research, project requirements, designs, and manufacturing processes. 

Given that all open source information and designs are public, anyone in the world can add to this body of knowledge, develop derivative designs, or manufacture supplies from existing plans without having to design their own. 

# Networking Problem Solvers 

The first major step in the Citizen Maker Response was connecting makers around the world, and sharing as much accurate COVID-19 information as widely as possible so that makers could develop solutions. Most makers, like most people in the world, had no idea what COVID-19 was or how to fight it at the beginning of the pandemic. Makers turned to existing social media and digital networks or created new ones to determine how to help both their local communities and the world. Sharing news articles, preprint medical studies, and primary source interviews with medical practitioners trained in COVID-19 response (such as Dr. Ali Raja and Dr. Shuhan He’s “Ask Me Anything” interview on Reddit) provided much-needed information on the nature of the disease and treatment protocols as this information was discovered. 58 

Open Source Medical Supplies, an author of this paper and one of the first COVID-19-specific maker response communities to form in the U.S., was launched as the Open Source COVID-19 Medical Supplies Facebook Group on March 10, 2020. On March 11th, the administrative team interviewed healthcare workers that had just been trained in COVID-19 response to determine what medical supplies were needed, shared those interviews with the group openly, and then

collectively began to author and curate a Medical Supply Guide to help inform the development of medical supplies necessary to fight the pandemic. 59 

The primary purpose of the guide was to provide layperson-accessible information to makers about COVID-19, as well as guidance on how to design medical supplies that met global health and regulatory standards. The first version of the guide was published on March 18, only 8 days after the start of the forum and 3.5 weeks before the FDA released any EUAs or guidance for non-traditional manufacturers. Three weeks after its formation, OSMS began actively organizing “Local Response Groups” to help makers meet demand in their communities and regions. Within one month, it had accumulated a global network of over 70,000 makers, fabricators, community organizers, and medical professionals working to meet the medical supply challenges stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Nation of Makers, an author of this paper and a pre-existing network of makers that pivoted to support this pandemic response, is a national non-profit established in 2016 to support maker organizations (makerspaces, maker events, and other organizations that support and affiliate with the maker community) through community building, resource sharing, and advocacy. During the pandemic, Nation of Makers provided regular informational updates, access to resources (including funding for PPE production) and calls to action in its network of maker organizations across the U.S. and the world. Other similar pre-existing and robust maker networks included the Fab Foundation, which helps maintain a network of over 1,700 Fab Labs in 90 countries, and Make Community, the company that publishes “Make:” magazine and the worldwide Maker Faire network. Some networks specialized in connecting certain types of responders. Just One Giant Lab, a non-profit organization started in 2018 to help provide organizational platforms for citizen science and engineering efforts, recruited tens of thousands of medical professionals, engineers, and scientists to help develop ways to fight COVID-19, ranging from PPE design to open source vaccine development. Helpful Engineering, a startup non-profit founded to help engineer solutions to the pandemic, collected over 15,000 engineers at its peak to specifically design open source PPE and medical devices. In a nod to the Citizen Maker Response being a successful alternative to the failures of both the government (Plan A) and business (Plan B) responses to COVID-19, it was termed “Plan C” by Dale Dougherty, Make: Community President, a leader within the maker movement. 60 

Beginning in mid-April of 2020, Nation of Makers Executive Director Dorothy Jones-Davis and Dougherty began hosting a free online weekly community show titled “Plan C: Live” 61 as a mechanism to share best practices and success stories broadly with the maker community. They regularly interviewed a panel of maker responders from around the world typically

# Distributed and Iterative Open Source Design 

Larger forums such as the Open Source COVID-19 Medical Supplies (OSCMS) Facebook group served as centralized focal points for designers and engineers to share open source designs publicly, gather feedback from a like-minded community, and distribute production plans to fabricators. Designers and engineers would typically create posts with images or plans, field questions or commentary from other designers, medical practitioners, and fabricators, and then revise designs appropriately until they were ready for release. Engagement was high; during April and May 2020, a well-performing post in the OSCMS forum might attract close to 100 comments, 1,000 reactions and over 10,000 views globally. During peak periods, the forum might see hundreds of posts in a single day.

Individual project designs came from all over the world, reflecting the truly global extent of the supply chain crisis. One of the earliest designs for isolation suits and gowns came from the Manila Protective Gear Sewing Club. The Vice President of the Philippines, Leni Robredo, sent the club isolation gowns and suits that were in short supply for reverse engineering. Once engineers from the club reverse-engineered the designs, the plans were posted publicly and became one of the first suit and gown patterns posted in the OSMS Project Library. The OSMS Project Library hosts some of the many cloth mask designs makers used, but one of the most popular patterns was developed by Iris Luckhaus, 68 a German illustrator and sewist. Luckhaus, who was fed up with cloth masks fogging up her glasses, made a small change to the

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 29 nosepiece of a standard cloth mask design that eliminated fogging. Her post went viral on the OSCMS Facebook group with incredible user engagement and over 300 shares. Since then, tens of thousands of her cloth masks have been made around the world. As open source designs developed, even the testing phase of these designs was facilitated through open source exchange. In the case of masks, for example, certified technical testing facilities specializing in particle filtration and fit testing became overrun with demands to test imported commercial PPE and new mask designs from pivoting domestic manufacturers. Testing was largely inaccessible for maker responders who didn’t have significant financial resources. 

“Access to reliable, repeatable, and affordable testing for masks has remained a challenge for mask makers throughout the pandemic. Cost is prohibitive. Traditional testing of basic mask safety, efficacy, and filtration costs $3-5k per mask design and [doesn’t] include validation for reuse. For FDA (510k) approval costs are typically 5-10x higher.” — Dr. Jocelyn Songer, PhD, MakerMask, Athol, Colorado, United States 

Open source efforts emerged to bridge this testing gap for the sake of the larger community. MakerMask became a trusted volunteer open source design hub, testing center, and database for the filtering efficacy of various plastics and cloths. It developed thorough documentation for at-home analog testing and performed professional analyses of commercially available mask materials. 69 

One of the earliest face shield designs came from the Prusa 3D printer manufacturing company, 70 a long-time proponent of open source designs. It has since acquired a European Union CE certification for making the shield on its printers, 71 and created instructions to help startup manufacturers acquire the certification themselves. Its initial design spawned a number of derivative open source designs, ranging from the DtM shield with forehead protection to specialized shields for other medical applications such as dentistry.

Source: OSMS Project Library 72 

Open source designs often reflected the designers’ on-hand manufacturing capacity, and evolved as the need for supplies became more severe and manufacturing volumes had to increase. The first designs circulated for face shields could be manufactured with 2 liter soda bottles and scissors in a crisis. The next iteration of maker-manufactured face shields were designed for 3D printing, as it was one of the easiest and most accessible manufacturing processes to begin production immediately. A number of makerspaces and individual makers had 3D printers on-hand, and could begin printing right away once design files were available. Later, face shields were designed for 2D laser cutting, which offered an order of magnitude faster production cycle over 3D printing, but is only available in dedicated manufacturing facilities or makerspaces. Ultimately, face shield designs evolved to utilize technologies such as injection molding, which could only begin after weeks of design and manufacturing of hardened tooling, but were significantly more productive than both 3D printing and laser cutting. As designers, engineers, and healthcare workers shared lessons learned in public forums, designs evolved to be cheaper, easier to manufacture, and more specific to the needs of users. 

# Open Source Design Repositories 

As designs matured with feedback and testing, they were gathered and curated in digital design repositories. Some pre-existing open source digital repositories were populated with new designs for medical supplies, including Thingiverse’s design library, the U.S. National Institute of Health’s (NIH) 3D Print Exchange, Prusa’s design forum, 73 and JOANN Fabrics’ pattern library. 74 Other repositories were founded explicitly to host COVID-19 medical supplies, including the OSMS Project Library, which hosts over 200 unique designs across 35 medical

These repositories vary in the type of manufacturing processes they serve and their degree of curation. Members of the public accessed designs in these repositories, often after being notified via viral social media posts in online communities that highlighted what the supplies could do for their communities, and began arranging for fabrication of these supplies for their communities. Some repositories led deliberate distributed efforts to create their own projects, such as JOANN, Prusa, and Budmen, a Syracuse, New York-based 3D printer manufacturer that released an open source face shield early in the pandemic. 76 

NIH’s 3D Print Exchange, Prusa’s design forum, and Thingiverse focused on designs that could be produced via 3D printer, while Joann’s pattern library focused explicitly on textile goods. The OSMS Project Library and ViralResponse’s community collected a variety of designs based on demand, agnostic of manufacturing process or tooling. Existing libraries such as Thingiverse often allowed anyone to post designs for any purpose with no curation. OSMS focused on collecting designs that had been evaluated by public health officials in some capacity, and the NIH 3D Print Exchange utilized testing criteria “informed by standards from the FDA, CDC, and NIOSH, and best practices for 3D printing methods and

# Medical Evaluation and Collaboration 

Many clinicians, hospitals, and laboratories partnered with maker responders and local manufacturers to design, prototype, test or evaluate open source PPE and medical supplies. In some cases healthcare workers and makers worked together to invent and produce new types of supplies specifically in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These relationships were critical not only to local efforts, but to the broader response, as makers trusted healthcare workers to evaluate supply designs in the absence of state or national guidance. Healthcare workers and hospital systems were also more open to accepting maker-manufactured supplies (and makers had more faith in producing open source supplies) if they knew the designs had been evaluated or tested by other healthcare institutions. Relationships between makers and healthcare providers varied significantly. Examples of medical-maker collaborations are described below. 

# Face Shields: New Use, New Design 

Prior to the pandemic, face shields were infrequently used against airborne or droplet pathogens. With medical institutions facing severe shortages of N95 respirators, face shields provided barrier protection against virus droplets and prolonged the life of a single disposable N95 by days to weeks. Given this adapted purpose and the resulting high frequency of use, face shield designs required modifications to increase comfort and durability. Rapid prototyping enabled regulatory agencies and clinicians to provide feedback on designs, and adjustments were often completed in a matter of days. 

Josef Prusa, of Czech Republic, developed one of the earliest open source face shield designs, the Prusa RC1. His design was then picked up in mid-March by Tim Prestero of the American non-profit Design That Matters (DtM) printed the Prusa RC1 shield for the Infection Control Department at the University of Washington Harborview Medical Center in Seattle. 78 

To improve protection from aerosolized virus particles, clinical staff requested a closed forehead design modification. Prestero presented a modified design with a slanted forehead visor (now called DtM-v3.1) two days later. The NIH expedited review of the DtM shield and on March 28, 2020 published the design as recommended for use in a clinical setting. 79 The regulatory

# Protective Gowns: Tug Tests and Flying Fabric 

Successful design and production of both disposable and reusable gowns was especially dependent on relationships between medical facilities and makerspaces or manufacturers. 

Gowns presented a unique manufacturing challenge as they required more skilled labor, specialized equipment and materials, and a longer manufacturing process compared to other PPE. Disposable isolation gowns are made from plastic-based materials and require thermal or ultrasonic welding instead of sewing or other more-common fabrication processes. Makerspaces and retooled manufacturing facilities often had to purchase thermal and ultrasonic welders and set up assembly lines in order to produce disposable gowns. Washable fabric gowns, by comparison, require hydrophobically treated fabric to meet the minimum protection standards, and skilled sewists experienced in garment manufacturing. Because of these requirements, gown production occurred primarily in groups able to organize centralized production lines and meet institutional approval processes. In March of 2020, Boston-area hospitals reached out to non-profit makerspace Artisan’s Asylum in Somerville, Massachusetts to procure gowns, and helped guide the manufacturing and acceptance process. 

“We researched all the ASTM, AAMI gown coverage and fabric permeability standards and found a ten-page, third-party analog test that we measured our fabric against. It was spun-bound, 35gsm material that was donated by Home Depot, the only material we could get in the beginning. There is a difference between testing raw materials and a finished gown so the hospitals told us that in the absence of testing [facilities], they were interested in the strength of the seams, the hydrophobic qualities of the fabric and how many we could possibly make. Hospitals sent couriers to pick up prototypes made from everything from painters cloth to 3M sheeting and we let the hospital executives literally tug on each different prototype’s seams to choose the strongest candidate. 

Winner? Lawn fabric from Home Depot.” — Sarah Miller, Artisan’s Asylum, Somerville, Massachusetts, United States 

FABRIC Tempe, a fashion innovation center in Tempe, Arizona, was approached by local hospitals who “were completely out of items” and began a close partnership to meet the need, 80 

and converted their manufacturing locations to accommodate FDA standards. A Dignity Health surgeon designed a gown pattern, which was tested in the in-house testing facility of Precision Fabric Group, a North Carolina fabric supplier that had previous experience with clean-room

By July 2020, FABRIC Tempe had manufactured over 80,000 FDA-approved reusable isolation gowns for both small and large healthcare facilities in Arizona. 83 At the time of publication, that number has grown to a staggering 500,000 reusable gowns. 84 FABRIC Tempe has since started a business, Reusa, for their PPE production, and, due to their prolific manufacturing, earned a visit from then-President Elect, Joe Biden, and Vice President Elect, Kamala Harris in October, 2020. 

# Intubation Boxes: Never Seen Before 

In early 2020, with sustained shortages across PPE categories and minimal information regarding how COVID-19 spread, clinicians themselves sought new solutions for protection when performing aerosolizing procedures. Dr. Lai Hsien-Yung of Taiwan prototyped the first known intubation box—a simple housing made of transparent acrylic or polycarbonate that is placed around the patient during intubation. 85 

News of the design spread quickly and U.S.-based hospital facilities, with the help of rapid prototyping and the maker community, 86 began testing and deploying both similar and modified designs. 87 While research suggests that some designs increase exposure to COVID-19, 88 those that incorporate design modifications such as negative pressure and active air filtration 89 or

# Respirators & Masks: Catalysts for Collaboration 

The shortage of N95 respirators was a catalyst for the maker-medical collaboration. Some of the earliest cloth mask patterns evolved as protection for existing commercial N95s, with hospitals publishing designs and requesting that community sewists drop-off finished masks at designated collection points. 91 Since it was unknown how long the N95 shortage would last, new mask designs were innovated as a stopgap, including reusable rigid respirators and non-woven polypropylene (NWPP) masks. Clinicians and makers worked side-by-side, perhaps more so than for any other design category, to develop and test prototypes with hopes of achieving N95-level or near N95-level filtering effectiveness. The University of Southern Mississippi’s 3D printing lab, Eagle Maker Hub, collaborated with Hattiesburg Clinic and Forrest General Hospital to design, test, and produce a thermoformed respirator mask shell which then had a viral filter added by medical facilities. Community sewists made fabric straps and the masks were successfully used in clinical settings. 92 The design was open sourced and supported by the Mississippi Polymer Institute (MPI). 93 

In another example of collaboration, the University of Florida anesthesiology department developed a mask made from non-woven polypropylene (NWPP) Halyard H600, which could be successfully fit-tested. Local maker Georgette Graham was engaged to sew mask prototypes and compile mask-making kits that were distributed to other sewists in the community. Finished masks were then brought back to the hospital for sterilization before use. 94 Although the design was created and tested by the anesthesiology department, the maker production network was critical for broad clinical reach.

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 36 Organizing for Production 

Thousands of small, locally-focused groups emerged to coordinate, produce and distribute supplies for their specific regions. These existed in parallel to the large, centralized design and engineering-focused groups such as the OSCMS Facebook Group, Helpful Engineering Slack and Nation of Makers email lists. These smaller groups made use of Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Reddit, Discord, Slack, existing maker forums and websites, mailing lists and other digital tools to communicate and coordinate their regional COVID-19 response. 

Individuals who responded to early demand signals looked for help across their personal networks to gather other volunteers, build momentum, and acquire the resources needed to produce supplies locally. People already affiliated with makerspaces, Fab Labs, universities, colleges or K-12 schools often organized volunteer efforts within those spaces. Business owners pivoted their production lines to answer calls from local healthcare systems. Individuals who were not part of a pre-existing institution often formed or joined social media-based networks focused on responding locally. These networks often consisted of hundreds to thousands of individual makers or crafters with fabrication equipment in a given region such as a city, county, or state. In some cases, existing makerspaces, Fab Labs, schools, and other institutions came together to form new, cross-organizational networks. Social media platforms provided easy ways to form, join, and share new emergency response groups across existing networks. New groups gained tremendous momentum early in the pandemic when pre-existing networks of makers migrated to new groups en masse as a result of viral social media posts. Both new and pre-existing social media channels were critical to building volunteer engagement, communicating and sharing accurate information and guidance, assigning work, and connecting to demand. In a very short period of time, these citizen-led production initiatives evolved into demanding and complex organizational structures which required a tremendous range of expertise. The mostly-volunteer workforce in these groups devoted tremendous numbers of hours in an attempt to meet the growing demand for supplies and the increasing responsibilities of an emerging organization, which included: DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 37

● Building collaborations to design and produce products, source materials, develop production lines and workflows, and troubleshoot scaled manufacturing. 

● Organizing volunteers to make parts, assemble items, pick up or allocate materials, and sanitize, package, and label the final product. 

● Organizing and coordinating regular team meetings. 

● Managing workflows and orders via intake forms, spreadsheets, and Airtable 95 databases. 

● Identifying and logging needs, aggregating sufficient product for distribution, coordinating product drop off, and sometimes even shipping materials or supplies. 

● Raising funds to purchase materials by developing websites and crowdfunding campaigns. 

● Reaching out to pre-existing and potential new partners to secure in-kind donations and monetary contributions. 

● Engaging government and emergency response officials for coordination and support. 

● Soliciting and responding to press inquiries to spread the word about their efforts and raise interest in the communities, which often led to future funding or materials donations. Discussion forums similarly evolved from questions focused on design solutions to include questions about production approaches, liability, packaging, labeling, distribution and more. On March 24, 2020 OSMS launched a registration form and “Local Response Network” for Citizen Maker Response groups in order to map the global effort and share best practices. 96 Two days later, OSMS released version 1 of the Local Response Guide, a repository of best practices for local emergency manufacturing responses. 97

The video gained immediate traction, publicizing best practices for the Citizen Maker Response, and, at the time of publication, has accumulated over 600,000 views. These types of examples and playbooks helped small groups across the globe self-organize into effective emergency responders. 

The larger organizing groups started to track and then map the Citizen Maker Response groups producing supplies, both to connect makers to each other and help healthcare workers and the public locate supply. Nation of Makers was tracking U.S. efforts, and collaborated with #FindtheMasks, a North American PPE donation match platform, to create a new layer of their map. FindTheMakers featured local production locations with an option to overlay the FindtheMasks PPE request data. Shortly thereafter, OSMS Local Response and the Fab Foundation Fab Lab networks shared their data sets with FindtheMakers, resulting in the most comprehensive view on the international Citizen Maker Response. As of publication date, 895 maker response groups and 3,865 requesting organizations have been listed on FindTheMakers, with most activity taking place during Q1-Q3 2020.

# Sourcing Raw Materials 

Finding the raw material sources necessary for production, such as plastic filament for 3D printing, transparent PETG plastic, fabric, elastic, and more became a costly challenge for fabricators. As supply chains dried up because so many manufacturers were making PPE DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 39 simultaneously, prices soared and inventories were depleted. 99 Several makerspaces reported having to send members out to every hardware store within driving distance in order to acquire raw materials like transparent plastic, Tyvek home wrap for isolation gowns, and more. Elastic cord and filtering material for masks became incredibly difficult and expensive to acquire. Makers in the 70,000 member OSCMS Facebook group also found that network to be a source of raw materials. Members freely shared when a company had supplies in stock or was offering a discount to those helping with the PPE crisis. Members with extra material they could not use frequently advertised it for sale or gave it away for free if picked up locally (or sold material for the cost of shipping, if needed). In one instance in April, 2020 one member who sold elastic cord on her Etsy shop received a large overseas shipment that had been placed prior to the pandemic. She offered her elastic cord, at cost, to makers in the group. This enabled many sewists to resume their cloth mask making, which had stalled due to the lack of availability of elastic cord from commercial sources. At the time of this posting, members of the OSCMS Facebook group are still using it as a place to trade and give away raw materials for making PPE and medical supplies.

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 40 Locating demand signals and organizing distribution was another significant scope of work for local response groups. Many community campaigns and national hubs (e.g. Get Us PPE or FindTheMasks) were created to locate and redistribute commercial products. In some instances local groups coordinated with those entities to leverage their data to deliver maker-made products where acceptable; however, the vast majority of groups relied on gathering their own local intelligence and demand requests. 

“I learned that distribution is the most expensive and difficult thing to accomplish— manufacturing is comparatively quite easy!” — Sam Neff, Richmond High Robotics Team 841, Richmond, California, United States 

As groups matured, supply requests arrived through a variety of channels. Groups created request forms on their websites, and team members fielded requests from healthcare and essential workers posted in their social media groups and forums. Once organized and in production, many proactively reached out to procurement officers at hospitals, health care facilities, and social service agencies to discover unmet needs. Pre-existing relationships in the community continued to facilitate distribution, especially to hospitals. 

“Most of our sales and distribution were based on personal contacts.“ 

— Will Holman, Open Works/Makers Unite, Baltimore, Maryland, United States 

“We connected with the Cleveland Clinic's innovation team and their procurement team. One of our former vice presidents who helped make think[box] possible now works at the Cleveland Clinic foundation as the chair of their Philanthropy Foundation. I knew that we needed to get connected quickly, so I reached out to her and she immediately introduced me to people pretty high up the ladder, who got things moving for us.” 

— Ian Charnas, Sears think[box], Case Western University, Cleveland, Ohio, United States 

In some instances, distribution of finished products was undertaken by partner organizations. Bicycle messengers and motorcycle clubs like Dames Do Care 100 in San Francisco, California and Blood Bikers East in Dublin, Ireland 101 pitched in to deliver supplies, often to individual clinicians. 

"We were doing drop offs at people's homes or meeting them in parking lots and handing PPE over. Not going through official channels, we weren't selling the PPE, just trying to get it to people who were desperate and who were telling us they had no other alternatives. We were getting them something to help keep them safer."

The Community Impact Survey and Fab Foundation global datasets reveal that 42.5% of items were produced by retooled small manufacturers making medical supplies for the first time— the largest quantity of items—followed by 32.5% from makerspaces and Fab Labs whose members worked together to produce supplies, 12.7% from distributed online groups of individuals and organizations, 7.0% from college and university groups whose manufacturing equipment had been repurposed, and 1.2% from K-12 school groups .

In the United States, an even greater percentage of total supplies produced—52.8%—was reported by retooled small manufacturers. Makerspaces and established Fab Labs produced 26.8% of the U.S. total, 8.5% came from universities or colleges, 5.9% came from distributed online groups, 1.6% came from individual makers producing supplies, and 1.1% were made by K-12 schools. All these groups served as emergency manufacturing responders for their local communities. In many cases, these groups were first to provide medical supplies to healthcare facilities once they had run out. Makerspaces 

OSMS, NoM, and Fab Foundation data indicate that makerspaces in 54 countries participated in medical supply design and production for their local communities. Makerspaces served as critical design centers, improvised factories, coordination hubs, and distribution facilities throughout the pandemic. They responded to early requests for PPE production, designed medical supplies on-demand as institutions needed them, coordinated tens to hundreds of volunteers each, and filled gaps in the medical supply chain as they appeared throughout the early pandemic. Their inherent flexibility, production capacity, and pre-existing communications networks were critical for early and fast response across a number of axes. To the extent that makerspaces serve as community centers for entrepreneurship, education, and workforce development, they often also have regional connections to other makerspaces, social service and non-profit organizations, and government officials. During the COVID-19 pandemic, makerspaces forged new and necessary partnerships with local healthcare institutions and began serving as both improvised production facilities for medical supplies and design/prototyping facilities to create new products and improve on existing designs. 

One example of prototyping, production and open-source sharing was Artisan’s Asylum. The Asylum was approached by several healthcare institutions in the Boston area to produce isolation gowns and other PPE that was in short supply. Their team reverse-engineered several isolation gown designs from products provided by local hospitals, identified local supplies of raw materials in hardware stores, acquired an ultrasonic welding tool from a nearby manufacturer, and arranged for over 80 volunteers to contribute to an improvised production line that manufactured 27,000 isolation gowns by the end of September 2020 with a grant from Get Us PPE. 105 The Asylum has since shared gown designs, best practices, and tips and tricks with other makerspaces to help them set up their own gown production lines across the U.S.

Maker Nexus, a 501(c)3 non-profit makerspace in Santa Clara, California, was shut down by California’s early quarantine and immediately began manufacturing PPE on its idle laser cutters and 3D printers. It recruited 600 members and volunteers to form both a distributed and centralized manufacturing operation. The distributed home-bound volunteer-makers shipped parts to the makerspace headquarters for assembly and distribution, which then shipped PPE to 570 organizations throughout the U.S. The Maker Nexus network produced 70,000 face shields and 5,000 cloth masks over the course of 4 months. 106 

In Durango, Colorado, the San Juan Regional Medical Center reached out to the MakerLab, a makerspace in the Powerhouse Science Center. The medical center notified MakerLab that it was running low on supplies, and MakerLab began designing and producing these necessary supplies with a network of over 160 makerspace volunteers within 7 days. MakerLab designed a variety of PPE including face shields and advanced ICU-grade supplies such as Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPR) and matching hoods. The design process for complex PAPR units took just 72 hours from request to prototype. The materials used in their construction were not FDA approved, so the Farmington Fire Department’s biohazard and hazmat coordinator tested and approved them for local hospital use. 107 MakerLab then shared these designs with the public through the OSMS Project Library. 

# College & University Makerspaces 

PPE and medical supplies were also produced in shuttered college and university campuses. In the case of Modesto Jr. College, in Modesto, California, the effort was spearheaded by Biology professor Dr. David Martin, who was contacted by former students working at the local hospital alerting him to the PPE shortages they faced. Following initial design work, he brought together other faculty members and students from across disciplines to improve face shield design and production. The College gave the go-ahead and its foundation provided an initial grant of $2,000. 108 

As production increased, the remainder of the costs were covered by the fabricators themselves. Recipients of the PPE included the Bay Area healthcare workers and local non-profits such

as Veterans Homes of California. 109 Modesto Junior College students on hospital internships were not only protected, but also gained valuable education on the benefits of properly functioning and fitting PPE. The UW-Makerspace in Madison, Wisconsin created their own open source face shield design called the Badger Shield, and partnered with Ford Motors and other large companies to produce hundreds of thousands of shields. The team also developed matching distribution software which sent Badger shields out based on urgency, location, and quantity needed. The university makerspace later designed the Badger Shield+, a face shield incorporating a cloth hood with a neck closure which offers more droplet protection than a traditional face shield, along with two other types of face shields that protect doctors wearing specialty glasses incompatible with traditional face shield designs. 110 

Engineers from Sears think[box] at Case Western Reserve University worked closely with leaders at Penn State Behrend college and product design company Nottingham Spirk to set up a face shield manufacturing line and produce approximately 150,000 easily-sterilized face shields using injection molding and die cutting. The think[box] team sold the face shields through an electronics manufacturer in western Pennsylvania at cost in order to ensure financial sustainability. Additionally, Sears think[box] partnered with a community Fab Lab in a low income Cleveland neighborhood to laser cut 8,000 face mask kits for distribution in that neighborhood. The organization also developed a unique design for a desktop UV chamber for N95 mask sterilization that has been licensed to a manufacturer with the intention of bringing it to market. 

# Individual Makers 

Some makers (40% of respondents surveyed by OSMS and NoM) created supplies on their own, delivering directly to their immediate communities and never joining a larger group. 

While these makers excelled in the production of cloth masks and face shields, they also produced a staggering number of ear savers, which are easy to print on a home 3D printer and were in high demand as many essential and healthcare workers adjusted to wearing a mask for entire work days.

Without access to a centralized source for demand data in their region, individual makers reported that they struggled to discover PPE needs in their communities. Though some individual makers had success providing for frontline workers, 111 many found that hospitals and other healthcare institutions were wary of homemade supplies from unsolicited sources, so individuals often partnered with a friend or family member who was a healthcare worker and used that personal connection to donate supplies. Overall, individual makers found it easier to sell their supplies online or donate their supplies to non-medical essential workers, such as police departments, school staff, restaurant workers, and retail workers, since they did not have the pre-existing restrictions on PPE usage that healthcare facilities do. Some individual makers, like Dave O’Meara of Venice, Florida produced on their own but partnered up with local response groups (OSCMS - South & Central Florida, in O’Meara’s case) for help with the distribution of their product. O’Meara was one of the first makers in the OSCMS community to begin printing ear savers, and at the time of this writing has produced over 100,000. He also curated his own collection of ear saver files that he tested and made available to the OSCMS community. 112 O’Meara worked tirelessly to help his community, dedicating his personal time and the use of his 3D printing farm, and largely covering the cost of materials. 

Sewist Nicole Angell of Dahlonega, Georgia produced 2,350 cloth masks on her own , working long days for weeks at a time to produce masks for her community, and recalled the early days of the pandemic saying, “At the height (March, April, May, June) I was working 12-14 hours a day trying to cut, sew, and package fitted facemasks. When I started out my main sewing machine broke down & I couldn't get it serviced until mid-May. I hauled out a 30 year old [sewing machine] scrubbed it, oiled it and used it for six weeks.” After donating some of her masks, she found commercial success by listing her masks for sale on her Etsy and Zibbet shops 113 to help cover the cost of materials for her donations.

Nick Franklin had an idea for an ear saver design and used feedback from the OSCMS Facebook Group to help him iterate the design and work through testing. In August, 2020 his SeaMass ear saver design was finalized and the design files were published under an open-source license—free to anyone who wanted to print their own. Franklin currently sells injection molded versions of the SeaMass ear saver on Amazon ,114 but the files remain free for the 3D printing community through the OSMS Project Library 115 and makers can still produce and distribute them in their communities.

# Retooled Manufacturers 

The largest source of new medical supplies outside of the traditional medical supply chain were small and mid-size manufacturing businesses that retooled existing manufacturing equipment and retrained employees to produce new supplies. These manufacturers commonly found that demand for their existing product line faltered, or that the pandemic was affecting their communities in ways they could help impact. Some state governments, hospitals, and other institutions reached out to small manufacturers, asking them to retool and produce PPE, but many simply retooled on their own. Kaas Tailored, a 46 year old textile company in Mukilteo, Washington that specializes in furniture upholstery, is one such retooled manufacturer. In March 2020, the Providence chain of 51 hospitals requested help making PPE and within 48 hours Kaas had incorporated a subsidiary called Kaas Health and began focusing on face masks and face shield production for the community. 117 Kaas sourced its raw material from Providence, which individually approved their design for hospital use. Kaas then partnered with Nordstrom in March to produce 100,000 cloth masks for Providence, 118 set a goal to eventually produce one million masks with Nordstorm’s

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 48 help, 119 and was one of the first traditional manufacturers to upload open source, manufacturing-grade plans, machine instructions, and blueprints for cloth masks and face shields for other manufacturers. 120 This fast sharing of information allowed for other manufacturers to retool and use their patterns to mass produce masks. Daniels Wood Land (DWL) in Paso Robles, California is another example. The 25-year-old company produced tree houses pre-pandemic, was considered non-essential, and had to shutter operations during the early California quarantine. The company closed its doors, laid off 54 employees, and started asking local fire department officials how they could help. The fire department provided them with an isolation gown that was in short supply, the company reverse-engineered it within 24 hours and began production. 121 Since the beginning of the pandemic, DWL has hired an 400 staff to produce and distribute over 7 million isolation gowns, and continues to produce tens of millions of gowns for federal contracts. In Minnesota, two companies, Frost River Trading Company and Duluth Pack, retooled after their state’s quarantine began in late March and their usual canvas and leather luggage operations were shut down. The wife of the Frost River founder, Chris Benson, was an anesthesiologist and alerted him to the upcoming shortage of PPE. Both companies pivoted to produce face shields and cloth masks, producing 45,000 face shields for the St. Luke’s and Essentia Health hospital systems in Duluth. Frost River produced 2,000 cloth masks a day with a team of 33 part-time sewists and Duluth Pack produced 200,000 gowns for hospitals, doctor and dental offices, and assisted living facilities. 122 

Some 3D printer manufacturers, formerly providing or curating designs for the open source hardware ecosystem as a fundamental part of their business model and value proposition, moved quickly to activate their maker communities with designs they developed. Budmen, a Syracuse, NY 3D printer manufacturer focused on artists and creatives, spent 24 hours designing a face shield on March 14, 2020. Within 24 hours, 500 people had downloaded

their design and began printing it. 123 Over the course of the pandemic, they would manufacture over 28,000 of their Budmen face shields through their distributed network. Small manufacturers have proven their ability to both pivot quickly and become incredibly productive in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many engaged directly with healthcare and community customers that needed products, and were able to supply significant portions of the product demanded. Some shared professionally-developed designs that aligned with their specializations, which accelerated local and global response. 

# Distributed Manufacturing Networks 

In addition to individual makers, makerspaces and small manufacturers, a new approach to manufacturing provided a significant number of supplies throughout the pandemic. Distributed manufacturing networks, organized online and often consisting of collaborative networks of companies, makerspaces, schools and/or individuals that owned fabrication equipment, sprang up across the world to provide a significant volume of PPE to their regions based on shared open-source design files. One early and significant example of small businesses forming a distributed manufacturing network was Z-Verse, a Columbia, South Carolina-based software developer that builds distributed manufacturing software tools. In late March 2020, it began receiving calls for help from local medical institutions and government officials, and in response developed a face shield design that was freely distributed to 20 separate injection molding companies. It provided a single ordering interface to the public, and coordinated group orders and production efforts across the participating companies to manufacture and ship over 4.6 million face shields over the course of 3 months. The face shields were shipped to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the South Carolina Emergency Management Division, and local hospitals in Palmetto State. 124 

In late March and early April 2020, the Illinois PPE Network formed across the state of Illinois. DePaul University makerspace leadership organized the network, which included Northwestern University, Chicago Public Schools, Chicago Public Libraries, the Museum of Science and Industry, the Chicago Peace Fellows, and various Illinois makerspaces, libraries, and schools across the state. This network shared designs for face shields and cloth masks, and linked producers directly to donees that needed supplies. The network raised over $119,000 from private donors and corporate sponsors, and used that money to create over 100,000 face shields for 181 institutions in 3 months. 125

Maker’s Asylum was able to produce 135,000 face shields in its own facility, and the M19 Collective was able to produce more than 1 million face shields as a whole, within 6 weeks. 127 

Open Works, a 501(c)3 non-profit makerspace in Baltimore, Maryland, is an example of a mixed, distributed+centralized model. It gathered 388 volunteers with 3D printers through pre-existing online communication channels to print face shield frames at home. Volunteers dropped these frames at Open Works, where 28,270 face shields were assembled and later distributed within the span of 4 months. 128 The makerspace also co-authored a report on their efforts and process—perhaps the single best written documentation currently available on one makerspace’s response. 129 

Several online networks of crafters and sewists formed to make cloth masks from shared open-source patterns. Relief Crafters of America, an online network that was established in 2019 to create and send crafted items for animals injured during the 2019 Australian wildfires, asked their 58,000 members to pivot their focus to cloth masks and other sewn PPE items. Members would fill out a form, commit to the production of a certain number of masks, and would receive mailing information for where to send the finished product. By July 2020, this 100% volunteer effort created over 30,000 cloth masks and distributed them to 171 facilities across the U.S. Other examples of online networks include MakeMasks2020, which attracted a following of 747 people, raised $3,400, and managed to produce over 100,000 cloth masks across the U.S. and Canada. 130 Crafters Against COVID-19 Seattle attracted over 2,600 Facebook group members, raised $21,000, and jointly created over 97,000 cloth masks. 131 In perhaps the largest distributed crafter effort in the United States, JOANN led a nationwide effort to craft over 400M cloth masks after the CDC recommended cloth masks for use in public to combat the

COVID-19 pandemic. It distributed free open-source cloth mask patterns and kits that members of the public used to fabricate cloth masks for their communities. 132 

Something Labs is a diverse, distributed collection of healthcare workers, designers, engineers, machinists, existing manufacturers, and improvised manufacturing centers that formed in response to the PPE crisis. They have designed and produced multiple types of PPE and medical devices. As of mid-December 2020, they have collectively produced over 34,000 face shields, 64,000 PAPR cuffs, 190,000 isolation gowns, 24,000 PAPR tabs, 200 intubation boxes, 60 sneeze guards, and more. Due to their early relationships with healthcare workers, they have collectively stayed in-tune with current medical supply demands, and have been able to shift production as necessary to supplies that are most needed in their local medical community. One such niche was PAPR repair, a scope of work that evolved from an individual clinician’s off-hand request to a national repair-by-mail service. Their medical partnerships allowed them to identify a need for isolation gowns that was so significant, they actually rented a centralized space to start up a production line after initially starting as a distributed, online effort. Like many Citizen Maker Response efforts, Something Labs actively worked to transfer knowledge and files to manufacturers in order to scale production. After a hand-off through a personal connection, Boston Scientific, a major medical manufacturer, went on to produce over 1M face shields that had been designed by Something Labs. 133 

These distributed networks demonstrate the power of volunteerism when combined with modern communication technologies. Highly populated networks coalesced using various internet-enabled communication platforms to design open source medical supplies, share those designs widely, iterate on those designs, and produce those designs in coordinated groups en masse for local communities and institutions. 

# Primary/Secondary (K-12) Schools 

In the U.S., many primary and secondary schools shut their doors in March and April and moved to virtual learning to allow their students to finish the 2019-2020 school year at home, with the hope of keeping staff and students safe until the pandemic came to an end. By summer, it was clear that the pandemic would not end before the next school year, and with PPE still in short

supply for medical workers, some K-12 schools turned to the resources under their own roofs and began to manufacture PPE. 

In Michigan, Gail Alpert, President of FIRST in Michigan, saw the PPE crisis looming in her state and decided to do something about it. When students learned their annual FIRST Robotics competitions were cancelled due to COVID-19, they wanted to put their time and energy back into helping fight PPE shortages within their communities. Alpert, along with longtime volunteers of FIRST in Michigan, Lisa and Eric Savage, issued a team challenge to create 1 million pieces of PPE for first responders and frontline workers. 134 

These high school students already had access to tech labs within their schools, many of which had the equipment necessary to begin producing PPE. 

"The skills students acquire through FIRST are life-changing for both the students and for society. Nowhere was this more evident than during the Pandemic. Our teams immediately put their skills to work making PPE, using CAD to maximize the number of items that could be 3D printed at one time and separating tasks to achieve their goals while isolated." — Gail Alpert, President, FIRST in Michigan, Michigan, United States 135 

Word quickly spread across social media, and soon FIRST Robotics teams in neighboring states wanted to help with the challenge. The effort soon included participants from 13 states, and the FIRST in Michigan PPE challenge has produced 96,000 face shields, 2.16 million ear savers and other PPE accessories, and over 3,500 safety glasses to date, for a total of over 2.26 million items. 136 

In New Brighton, Minnesota, the KnightKrawler FIRST Robotics team started their own face shield printing effort. In less than 48 hours from initial request to running lab, the high school robotics team worked with the school district to develop a health safety plan, modified their website to create an online ordering system, and consolidated 24 3D printers from 4 schools in the district. As it was for most makers, obtaining raw materials was a major challenge. Through team relationships at 3M and Stratasys, KnightKrawler was able to secure enough plastic to cut over 30,000 clear face shields and, using their engineering skills, the high school students

created a custom cutting machine from robot parts, which was at the core of a student-run assembly line to cut, corner and punch the shield plastic. 137 

Running their 3D printing farm for 10 hours per day, 6 days per week, the team was able to print over 200 visors and cut hundreds of clear shields per day. Cutting shields was much quicker than printing visors, and shortly after production began the team’s online ordering system was overwhelmed with over 10,000 requests. It became obvious the team could never print enough visors on their own for the large number of shields they could create. KnightKrawler reached out to other robotics teams and makers for help and, between those groups and a local plastics manufacturer, they received thousands of 3D printed and injection molded visors. This community effort allowed the team to fill their own orders for face shields, and also ship thousands of clear visor parts to other robotics teams across the U.S. who were printing visors but could not find clear plastic. In total, the 14 KnightKrawler teammates and their coach produced 37,000 pieces of PPE for their local and national communities. These donations were made to local hospital systems, health clinics, correctional facilities, dental offices, the local Veterans Affairs office, and police and fire stations. Once school resumed, KnightKrawler began using the remaining plastic to make large clear desk shields for speech pathologists and special education teachers to use in situations where face masks were not an option. The team’s hard work and dedication to their community earned them a COVID19 Community Response award from the Minnesota Technology Association, alongside 3M and the University of Minnesota. 138 

# Critical Resources for Design and Production 

Maker responders were able to respond quickly to the need for local fabrication of medical supplies by being connected to a global network that was sharing open source plans and best practices, by having access to necessary manufacturing equipment, and by having access to or being able to build local communities of volunteers to support the efforts to provide local fabrication services.

# Open Source Networks and Information 

Of all makers who completed the authors’ Community Impact Survey, 41.6% indicated that networking with other responding groups and individuals was helpful (via individual introductions, certain social media groups, or other forums), and 27.7% of survey respondents listed available open-source design information as helpful (via access to different repositories and libraries), which far exceeded the 16.5% of makers that listed some sort of access to funding and grant opportunities as being helpful.

“[OSMS] provided a community that validated our efforts and provided important information regarding effective PPE to offer and proper ways to clean and deliver that equipment. We were able to prepare and organize weeks before the virus reached our country due to the experiences, resources, procedures, source files, etc. shared by the maker community as a whole.” — Andres Hermes, TecLab Guatemala, Guatemala The broader community helped makers leverage the internal resources they already had access to, including manufacturing equipment, like-minded local communities willing to help. The larger networks also played a role in sourcing and securing access to raw materials. 

# Manufacturing Equipment 

All responding individuals and groups had access to manufacturing equipment of some kind, and most groups had access to multiple types of relevant manufacturing equipment. Exactly what type of equipment any particular group owned informed what types of supplies they could produce and what production volumes they could achieve in a given time frame. DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 55 Source: OSMS and NoM Community Impact Survey data 

According to the OSMS & NoM Community Impact Survey, most responding groups had access to 3D printing and sewing machines, and just over one third had access to high-speed laser cutting. All of these processes are immediately useful prototyping and fabrication processes; given the proper plans, blueprints or patterns, simple items can be produced with little to no preparation time. As the COVID-19 pandemic wore on, a smaller subset of responding groups were able to activate equipment that was more productive, but which required more time to design appropriate plans and produce the necessary tooling. Die cutting, vacuum molding and injection molding— used by approximately 10% or fewer groups each—are able to produce orders of magnitude more parts than 3D printing, sewing, and laser cutting, but can take weeks to set up properly. Homebound individual makers typically only had access to personal 3D printers or sewing machines, while institutions, makerspaces and manufacturers had access to more productive equipment—both in terms of the production capability of each machine and the number of machines available. In some cases, institutions like libraries, schools and universities allowed staff, students and volunteers to take manufacturing equipment (typically 3D printers) from the locked-down campuses into their homes, allowing many to have ready access to the tools and equipment needed to produce supplies. Authorities overseeing these institutions found this to be a rapid solution to the supply chain gap, while at the same time utilizing the skills of the already-trained and trusted volunteers. 

# People and Teamwork 

Aside from connections to a global network and the manufacturing equipment itself, the most critical resources citizen responders accessed were other volunteers and paid staff members that stepped up to produce medical supplies. The Community Impact Survey data represents DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 56

Figure 8: Size of organizations that responded 

Globally, just over half (54.8%) of the OSMS and NoM Community Impact Survey respondents reported they were either individual makers or that they were working in small groups of five people or fewer. Just over one third (33.9%) reported that they were medium sized groups with six to 100 people, 7.1% belonged to large groups with as many as 101-500 people, 3.1% reported up to 4,000 members in their organizations, and five groups (1.1%) reported a staggering 4,000 people or more belonging to their organization. Numbers from U.S. Makers followed a similar pattern with 58.0% reporting they were individual makers or working in small groups of five or fewer, 32.9% reported working in medium sized groups of six to 100, 7.5% belonged to large groups of 100-500, 2.1% belonged to extra-large groups of 501-4000 members, and .80% belongs to super-sized groups of 4,000+ individuals. 

# Funding and Donations 

While 93% of the makers producing supplies volunteered their time and labor, the raw materials to make supplies still required funding. Most responding groups sought their own funding, donations, or other kinds of support to sustain their efforts. Sales of products to recoup costs were a secondary consideration in large part due to the emergency nature and rapidity of the response. Sorting through liability concerns, vendor paperwork, and compensation for a distributed and wide ranging labor force was too time

intensive and riddled with barriers to delivery. U.S. makerspaces in particular are largely organized as not-for-profit educational or community service entities 139 ; many do not carry product liability insurance. Fundraising for donations to offset materials cost (and in some cases to provide some compensation for machine wear and tear and facility overhead) was thus a far easier and more traveled path. Of all groups reporting, re-tooled businesses were far more likely to pivot their efforts and stand up sales ( 83% of all retooled manufacturers compared to 35% of makerspaces, 33% of K-12 groups, 28% of individual makers, 15% of online organized groups, and 4% of university groups) .

> Source: OSMS and NoM Community Impact Survey data

Almost half of U.S. respondents to the OSMS & NoM Community Impact Survey (47.0%) were able to obtain materials donations from their communities, materials suppliers, or other groups within their network. Fewer than one third of all responding groups (29.0%) received direct payment for the “PPE items” they made either at-cost or for-profit; groups that did not solicit for direct payments instead relied on community crowdfunding campaigns, individual donations or staffed foundation grants, corporate sponsorship, or government funding of some kind. 3D printer filament and plastic suppliers, such as MatterHackers 140 and Keene Village Plastics 141 

offered discounts on their supplies, while other industrial suppliers such as McMaster-Carr, worked directly with fabricators and those on the front lines of rapid prototyping and development. 142 Suppliers and corporations, compelled to expand their sense of civic duty

Government Funding 2.4% and corporate social responsibility to frontline workers, liberally donated supplies. Coca-Cola contributed to the production of 1.14 million face shields across multiple states, through material donations and funding for PPE production. The company worked directly with MakeItLabs in Nashua, New Hampshire to distribute transparent PET plastic to businesses and makerspaces, including academic institutions and community organizations. Additionally, Coca-Cola directly funded the production of face shields, fueling local economies. 143 

Nation of Makers served as a connector organization for limited funding provided by two key private sector funders. In April of 2020, in collaboration with Nation of Makers, the nonprofit Get Us PPE launched its first maker grant program, supporting the purchase of raw material supply to make PPE; it later expanded this program to cover the cost of labor and equipment. Get Us PPE subsequently launched the PPE for Black Lives fund, which in part supported maker efforts to produce and distribute cloth masks and face shields for Black Lives Matter protesters. 144 In response to evolving PPE needs and an unprecedented demand for gowns, in August 2020, a collaboration with Nation of Makers, Something Labs, Artisan’s Asylum, and Get Us PPE launched the Maker Gown Cohort, providing seed funding and mentorship to maker groups committed to pivoting to gown production. 145 A second private sector funder that was pivotal to the support of regional PPE production hubs was Accenture, providing both funding and volunteers to support the PPE efforts of four makerspaces in Connecticut, Illinois, California, and Georgia. 146 

It is worth noting explicitly that, despite local, state, and federal governments taking responsibility for arranging emergency production and supply shipments for healthcare institutions for much of the early pandemic period, only 2.4% of U.S. survey respondents reported having received any government funding despite 24.2% of respondents reporting that they had created a new partnership with a governmental entity.

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 59 The Impact of the Response 

The Citizen Maker Response provided crucial supplies that helped keep healthcare and essential workers safe during the earliest, most-critical shortages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite needing to design medical supplies from scratch before manufacturing them, maker responders often delivered supplies to those in need weeks to months before centralized manufacturers were able to ramp existing production up enough to make up for early shortages. Access to maker-made supplies kept many hospitals, clinics, and essential businesses open when they would have otherwise had to shut down for lack of PPE. As the supply chain healed and began to serve the needs of primary hospital chains that could place large bulk orders, makers quickly pivoted and provided supplies to smaller institutions like clinics, nursing homes, homeless shelters, schools, and essential businesses that had difficulty competing in the marketplace. Makers were also able to provide supplies specifically to underserved communities that had little or no access to supplies. The agility of manufacturing, speed of response, and ability to target exactly where supplies were needed most allowed makers to fill gaps in the marketplace across the country. 

# Where Supplies Went 

Most maker-made supplies went directly to frontline workers in healthcare and under-resourced populations. U.S. respondents to the OSMS and NoM Community Impact Survey reported that 76% delivered at least once to a hospital, 72% delivered to individual medical professionals, 57% delivered to senior housing/healthcare facilities, and 54% delivered to other medical clinics such as rehabilitation centers and dentist offices. A high percentage (50%) delivered to organizations serving needs of under-resourced communities, including homeless shelters, Native American tribes, and non-profit agencies serving low income populations. 45% also reported supplying schools. DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 60 Figure 10: U.S. Distribution destinations of maker-made PPE

In many cases these supplies made the difference between healthcare facilities and essential services remaining open or closing due to lack of PPE. 

"These gowns enabled this hospital to take 4 additional ICU patients today which they otherwise could not have due to PPE shortages and rationing." — David Rainosek, M.D., Associate Medical Director of St. Vincent Rehabilitation Hospital, Arkansas, United States

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 61 In many cases, makers were able to identify and respond to needs from under-resourced communities that often go unnoticed or unattended by government agencies and supply chains that prefer large bulk orders. 50% of U.S. makers reported providing PPE and supplies for non-profit agencies and social services that care for low-income communities, and a number of maker efforts deliberately targeted communities that reported being unable to acquire supplies for themselves. The U.S. Treasury Department withheld $8B in coronavirus relief funds from tribal nations across the U.S. that were earmarked, in part, for PPE and medical supplies. These funds were delayed for several months after the CARES Act was signed into law, despite the law requiring disbursal within 30 days. 147 This delay prevented tribal nations from purchasing PPE in a timely manner, which contributed significantly to the fact that the COVID-19 mortality rate is twice as high in Native American communities than in the general U.S. population. 148 Makers across the U.S., and many within the tribes themselves, began producing masks specifically for tribal communities in order to protect them from COVID-19 while the tribes waited for funding for medical supplies. Some tribal communities were able to make enough masks for everyone within their tribes, and tens of thousands of masks and other supplies have been donated by maker groups created specifically to provide for the tribal nations. 149 

Rural communities within the U.S., whose hospital systems often struggle to provide adequate care for their populations due to lack of funding and state support, often did not have the funds or purchasing power to purchase sufficient PPE at the start of the pandemic. Makers in rural communities were able to supplement these shortages of PPE, with some maker groups reporting that they met their entire hospital demand at times in more-rural states like Alabama. 

# Rapidity of Response 

Makers and makerspaces were able to go into production immediately because they shared effective designs and learnings widely and openly, had access to large groups of volunteers already, and were already equipped for rapid prototyping manufacturing processes. A good example of this orientation and speed of response is exemplified by a respirator valve that Italian engineer Cristian Fracassi engineered, prototyped, tested, and delivered back to the hospital within 48 hours, providing the hospital with 100 out-of-stock parts as quickly as

and retooled manufacturer Prent Corporation of Janesville, Wisconsin, 152 were also able to produce and deliver face shields within 48 hours of being asked. Organized Amish sewing networks made 12,000 cloth masks for Cleveland Clinic within two days 153 and consequently received orders for 140,000 more.

Rapidity of response can also be evaluated by comparing the exponential growth rate of COVID-19 cases themselves with the exponential growth of production output of the Citizen Maker Response. OSMS conducted weekly production tallies of the OSCMS Facebook Group on Fridays, and charted production totals over time. Despite the time-sink of having to invent medical supply designs from scratch and prepare assembly lines, makers were able to match

Demand for the locally produced products (especially for face shields) declined quickly as larger domestic manufacturers and then later imports became available. Even the largest volume producers of face shields in the OSMS network (Z-Verse, at 4.6M total) reported that their market had evaporated by late June. Citizen Maker Response products got to the people who needed them first, but were supplanted once cheaper supplies were available, or when traditional purveyors could once again fill orders. 

“At a time when we were feeling totally abandoned in our fight against COVID, I think the rapidity with which OSMS was able to connect us with PPE supplies was really quite pivotal… and the psychological benefit that it provided to have this equipment delivered to our doorstep by caring and compassionate and capable people in the community with 3d printers and such, to come and bring us this stuff in our time of need. I mean, that was huge.” — David Rainosek, M.D., Associate Medical Director of St. Vincent Rehabilitation Hospital, Arkansas, United States 

Forbes magazine explicitly recognized the agility and speed of the Citizen Maker Response when they designated Makers as “Most Disruptive Innovator” in their year-end 2020 Technology Awards: “Before Apple and Nike turned their resources to PPE supplies, it was these hobbyists and independent 3D-printing companies that organized the resupply of frontline workers in communities across the United States facing dwindling stockpiles.” 155 

# Maintaining Mental Health 

Aside from the role the supplies themselves played in protecting communities from COVID-19, 

the act of receiving supplies from members of the public often helped supplement the mental health of healthcare and essential workers by proving community members cared about them even when they felt abandoned by suppliers, administrators, or government officials. 

“COVID-19 has added a huge amount of stress to the work lives of my operating room/Anesthesia staff. It is so important that staff feel safe and protected by their leader. I have received a large number of compliments, thankful that these superior face shields have been provided to us. I must, therefore, pass the thanks to you. You have provided a vital product which has allowed my staff of 40 Anesthesia providers, physicians, CRNAs, and technicians to feel SAFE.” 156 — Dean Steinberg, M.D., Vice Chair Anesthesiology, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States

In addition to protecting the mental health of workers, the act of making supplies preserved the mental health of makers themselves, who found themselves better able to cope with depression and senses of helplessness brought on by quarantines, lockdowns, and the pandemic itself. 

“Oddly, it's been some of the most special times in our lives. While everything is bittersweet with the tragedies endured, it has been an honor to serve in a way we could have never expected. We've all ended up so much different, and are so grateful for the communities that have come together over this.” — Sam Haynor, Something Labs, San Francisco, California, United States 

“Thank you for helping me survive the spring and summer without sinking into depression. This organization gave me hope in a better world. I am working a lot of hours right now and moving. But I will be back to sewing in the not too distant future.” 

— Alyson Burnett Rawitch, Individual Maker, Lenexa, Kansas, United States 

“Honestly, it was great to be involved in something with such amazing impact, but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that making PPE every waking hour of my life kept me alive during those days, and kept my mind away from the horror that was going on around me. I learned a lot through the process about 3D printing, community organizing, and how infectious diseases spread. This was not how I had planned to spend my summer, but doing nothing was not an option.” — Norman Witte, OSCMS -Michigan, Detroit, Michigan

America is once again in the throes of a COVID-19 surge as of this writing, setting an average daily record of 3,300 deaths and 130,000 hospitalizations in the U.S. as of mid-January 2021. As cases have mounted, PPE is once again in short supply. Nurses are on strike in several hospital systems across multiple states in the U.S. due, 158 in part, to a lack of PPE. 159 FEMA and the Government Accountability Office (GAO) have reported that PPE supply chains are still strongly affected and are not expected to catch up for months, 160 and some healthcare workers across the country are still reusing soiled PPE due to a lack of supply. 161 

# Unmet Demand 

As centralized manufacturers have slowly increased production of medical supplies over time, shortages have hit smaller facilities that do not have the purchasing power to compete in a strained market with large minimum orders. Get Us PPE reports that unfilled U.S. supply requests are now predominantly coming from secondary care facilities like nursing homes and homeless shelters (99%+ of requests in December 2020), whereas hospitals were a more-substantial source of requests earlier in the pandemic (36% in June 2020).

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 66 Get Us PPE estimates that, based on its current unfilled requests, the U.S. needs an additional 87M units of PPE per week .163 The items in highest demand from care facilities are disinfecting wipes, nitrile gloves, and hand sanitizer, which are unfortunately not products currently created in significant quantities by the Citizen Maker Response. Get Us PPE has also begun to track the needs of non-care facilities like schools, which report needing a much wider range of medical supplies than PPE, such as handwashing stations, hand sanitizer, transparent partitions, and cloth masks. These are products that can and have been produced locally by makers across the world.

Makers and small manufacturers that can produce supplies are excellent fits for currently-unmet demand expressed from schools and some smaller institutions. 92.4% of U.S. makers who responded to the authors’ Community Impact Survey reported minimum order quantities below 150 units per order. Meanwhile, Get Us PPE reports that more than 99% of their requests are coming from non-hospital institutions.. Unfortunately, this potentially-available small-scale distributed supply is disconnected from the demand of these smaller institutions , as these institutions do not know makers have the capacity to manufacture the supplies they need. 165

Anecdotal reports of hospital PPE shortages continue to surface. On December 19, 2020, nurses in Southern California drew straws to see who would risk intubating a patient without PPE, as their hospital had run out. 166 Re-using PPE intended for single-use applications is a controversial mainstay for some facilities, with soiled N95s still in circulation 167 and rationing still occurring, almost a year after the pandemic impacted the United States. 168 To date, more than 2,900 U.S. healthcare workers have died from Covid-19, a statistic cited by U.S. Congressional members as evidence of PPE shortages. 169 

# Slowed Production 

As of December, 2020, 58% of U.S. survey respondents reported being “still active.” 60% of those who reported being “still active” shared that production slowed due to decreased local demand from existing customers; 23.6% of makers who reported being “still active” also attributed slowing down to funding or staffing limitations. Of the “currently-inactive” groups surveyed, 91.0% report they can start production again if the need arises and/or support is provided; the predominant issue preventing them from restarting is funding for their work.

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 68 The combination of domestic larger manufacturers taking over production of items such as face shields and cloth masks, plus the return of Chinese exports, 170 has undercut the market for locally produced supplies. 

“The demand for USA-made gowns has dropped off the face of the earth. The fabric vendor is seeing that too. It’s rippling up through the newly-formed domestic supply chain. China is flooding the market with very cheap, and I feel unsafe, gowns. If you are a for profit healthcare facility you are most likely going to go for price and buy the imported gowns. It’s happening with both reusables and disposables.”

Though the majority of the Citizen Maker Response has either stopped or significantly slowed production of medical supplies, the vast majority reports having the ability to ramp production back up if the need arises and financial or other support is available. This network has proven its ability to provide significant surge capacity to produce supplies using open source plans, and has proven its ability to reactivate, pivot to new types of production, and scale as necessary to provide emergency supplies for local communities in dire need.

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 69 Opportunities for Policy Reform 

Direct U.S. Government involvement in the Citizen Maker Response was limited. 23.7% of U.S. based survey respondents reported they had created a new relationship with some government agency through their work. But only 2.4% received any government financial support (via grants or purchasing) for labor or supplies. 

“Now that we know that makerspaces can fill such a vital role... we need lawmakers to invest funds towards organizing these efforts and making sure they have the materials and support needed to ramp production back up when needed. “ 

— Craig Farrington, Factory Two, Flint, Michigan, United States 

The resounding success of the Citizen Maker Response in providing for emergency innovation and manufacturing opens up two key questions for U.S. decision and policymakers: 

1. How can we build on the momentum of the Citizen Maker Response to COVID-19, creating structures that integrate makers into the U.S. domestic response to crisis, and allowing makers respond to other critical challenges? 

2. What specific policies and support—increased access to funding, raw materials, testing facilities, partnership with government entities—at the local, state, and federal level, can be developed to support and sustain the Citizen Maker Response? In order to address these important questions, and to fully harness the full potential of the Citizen Maker Response, there must be coordination and support at the federal, state, and local levels. As was reinforced during the COVID-19 pandemic, each level of government carries its own decision-making and implementation power, and different levels of government also accordingly bear different resource allocation roles and responsibilities. Here we draw upon the experiences of a small number of maker groups that were positively affected by policies which enabled them to obtain the support and infrastructure to produce PPE rapidly and efficiently for their communities. In addition, we note the glaring gaps in policy that hindered a more effective response from the maker community by proposing policies that could enable an enhanced maker response in ensuing crises. 

# Enabling Policies 

When analyzing the limited federal, state, and local policies that enabled distributed PPE production, there were a few examples of policies that worked to support the Citizen Maker Response. DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 70 Crowdsourcing Open Source Design 

Founded in 2014, the NIH 3D Print Exchange is a collaborative effort led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in collaboration with the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development, and the National Library of Medicine. The Exchange “is an open, comprehensive, and interactive website for searching, browsing, downloading, and sharing biomedical 3D print files, modeling tutorials, and educational material.” 171 

At the beginning of the pandemic, the Exchange released its COVID-19 Supply Chain Response as a part of the COVID 3D TRUST” (Trusted Repository for Users and Suppliers through Testing). As stated on the Exchange’s website: “This collection represents a coordinated effort among the NIH/NIAID, FDA, VA, and America Makes to support the manufacturing of personal protective equipment (PPE) or other necessary medical devices that are in short supply due to the COVID-19 pandemic.” 172 

The availability of a portal to submit open source 3D printed medical designs for review for clinical or community use enabled a level of validation for community-designs and allowed more widespread sharing of successful designs, including warnings against design usage that required significant refinement for safety. Due to the maker community’s desire to help however they could, the Exchange saw a 6,000% increase in unique visitors on the site on March 30, 2020 (the date the maker community was invited to supply submissions.) 173 

The NIH 3D Print Exchange is a model for government facilitation of open source design sharing, and it points to the opportunity to expand this approach beyond 3D printing and additive manufacturing to other materials and technologies. 

# Regulatory Accommodations for the Citizen Maker Response 

Typically, personal protective equipment and medical supplies are approved by regulatory and safety agencies such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) to ensure the highest levels of safety and quality control. In the absence of typical supply chain pathways, and an abundance of makers and pivoting small and medium batch manufacturers able to produce high-quality PPE and medical supplies, there was an urgent need to allow for rapid production with a relaxation of typical regulatory hurdles.

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 71 Two federal policies enabled, and are continuing to enable, citizen production of PPE and medical supplies. Beginning in April of 2020, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) that waive manufacturing and labeling requirements for some, but not all, PPE and medical supplies and devices. 174 As stated on the NIH 3D print exchange, “when the EUAs are lifted, manufacturers ─whether industry or individuals ─must cease operations if they are unable to meet those requirements.” 175 

Similarly, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), issued the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act (PREP Act), authorizing the Secretary of HHS to issue a declaration that “provides immunity from liability (except for willful misconduct) for claims of loss caused, arising out of, relating to, or resulting from administration or use of countermeasures to diseases, threats and conditions determined by the Secretary to constitute a present, or credible risk of a future public health emergency to entities and individuals involved in the development, manufacture, testing, distribution, administration, and use of such countermeasures.” 176 By removing the possible liability faced by small manufacturers and makers when producing medical supplies and PPE, these emergency manufacturers could, in good conscience, act responsibly and safely to address the significant public health needs of the U.S. during the COVID-19 pandemic. Once published, the FDA’s EUAs were critical for clarifying the landscape for both health care institutions and the Citizen Maker Response. However, the confusion experienced in the lag time (approximately 1 month) between first Citizen Maker Response and the publishing date of the EUA suggests opportunities for improving FDA responsiveness or alternative workflows for open source regulatory pathways in crisis. 

# Local Funding = Local Impacts 

“We advocated and convinced the City of Shreveport to designate part of their CARES Act funding for PPE production.” — Demetrius Norman, President, NWLA Makerspace, Shreveport, Louisiana, United States 

The leadership of a few cities (Baltimore, Maryland; Oakland, California; Shreveport, Louisiana), upon receiving CARES Act or other pandemic-relief funding, specifically opened funding opportunities for maker organizations producing PPE. This funding not only enabled makers to continue production efforts, but also sustained their small businesses, and compensated

In March of 2020, the State of Maryland announced a $5M fund to support local manufacturing by small businesses filling PPE shortages. This funding trickled down to cities in Maryland, including Baltimore, MD to the Baltimore Development Corporation’s Made in Baltimore Program, where nine Baltimore manufacturers received funding to produce PPE. 177 With additional grants provided by the Baltimore Development Corporation, Open Works Makerspace was identified as a recipient of $15K in funding for PPE production. In November 2020, Ace Makerspace in Oakland, CA received $10K in CARES funding through an Oakland Arts program grant to help with “economic consequences due to COVID-19.” 178 Similarly, NWLA Makerspace in Shreveport, Louisiana secured CARES Act funding from the city of Shreveport for PPE production. The challenge for the Citizen Maker Response is how little funding reached these efforts (with survey data indicating less than 3% of respondents reported receiving any government grants or sales). Clearly, great potential exists to increase citizen maker accessibility to emergency response allocations across local, state and federal agencies and workflows. 

# State Support for Pivoting Manufacturers 

A few key examples of regional collaboration on the state level to support retooling and pivoted production for manufacturers were either integrated into already existing networks, or were newly stood up during pandemic response. 

State manufacturing programs to facilitate and incentivize surge manufacturing capacity during COVID-19 are a model to study as they did prove effective to stimulate production.

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 73 Emergency Response Team: (M-ERT) 181 to organize and operationalize critical path work streams necessary for Massachusetts manufacturers to pivot their operations to produce needed materials in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Members of the M-ERT include representatives from MIT, MIT Lincoln Labs, the Massachusetts Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MassMEP), Associated Industries of Massachusetts (AIM), other local universities, and multiple industry partners. M-ERT identified capable manufacturers who could pivot to and ramp up PPE production. It gave the companies guidance on sourcing materials, testing products, gaining regulatory compliance and training their workforce. Commonwealth funding was also made available to some manufacturers for equipment, labor and testing. The 50 manufacturers identified produced millions of items, including face shields, masks, gowns, sanitizer, test swabs, etc. One company has become one of the largest producers of gowns in the country. 182 The initial success of M-ERT is a result of prior state and private investments and pre-existing relationships with key stakeholders integral to the manufacturing ecosystem. 

In Maryland, Governor Larry Hogan announced a $5 million incentive grant program for Maryland-based manufacturers in March 2020, called the Maryland COVID-19 Emergency Relief Manufacturing Fund, to produce PPE and critical need items: N95 and surgical masks, gowns, Tyvek suits, face shields, goggles, gloves, ventilators and thermometers. These grants could be used for costs related to capital expenses such as machinery and equipment, raw materials needed for production, and operating expenses associated with increased production. Recipients included varying sizes and types of established manufacturers, none of whom previously produced PPE. 183 

One recipient of a $100,000 Maryland COVID-19 Emergency Relief Manufacturing Fund grant, Integrated Pharma Services, was previously testing materials and new technologies for mask efficacy (to help block viruses such as coronavirus), but was without plans to manufacture them. However, when the supply chain broke down, the combination of the state grant and the company’s own $200,000 capital investment enabled the actual production of masks, with initial runs of 4 million per month. 184

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 74 Crowdsourcing Innovation through Challenges 

To spur rapid solutions, Challenge America and the Veterans Health Administration Innovation Ecosystem partnered with America Makes to launch the COVID-19 Maker Challenge, open to subject matter experts in engineering, manufacturing, 3D printing, infection control, industrial and experience design, emergency response, and healthcare. 185 

Participants from private industry, leading research universities, federal agencies like the VA, and nonprofits had one week to hash out solutions that could be created rapidly and cost effectively through manufacturing processes like 3D printing. Each solution had to help solve the specific issue each team was prompted with at the start of the make-a-thon and support specific frontline workers or sectors impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. The first challenge kicked off in April and targeted first responders, the second environmental management, the third nursing home staff, the fourth in-home caregivers, and the fifth, concluding in October, disaster relief workers. Each virtual event included the following steps: frontline workers submitted the pandemic safety issues they face to the COVID-19 Maker Challenge. These recommendations were then reviewed by an advisory panel who selected the most challenging initiatives to complete. Next, experts in engineering, manufacturing, 3D printing, infection control, sanitation, industrial and experience design were recruited to form teams who donated their time to produce the solutions. Finally, volunteers met with the workers who submitted the challenges and spent one week working with them to refine their approach before launching a 72-hour sprint to design and build working prototypes suitable for rapid manufacturing. 186

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 75 Policy Recommendations 

The 2020 COVID-19 PPE crisis has revealed a number of specific opportunities for government agencies to better integrate with and enable the Citizen Maker Response to emergencies. Below we detail our recommendations for U.S. Policy reform, although these suggestions may also be applicable and implementable in other countries. . 

# 1. Formalize the Citizen Maker Response Network 

While the focus of this report is on the Citizen Maker Response to COVID-19, the design, prototyping and production capabilities could be utilized in a wide range of response efforts, including responses to natural and man-made disasters (e.g. hurricane, flood, fire, etc.). To plan for a greater national resilience and future disaster response, designers, prototypers, engineers, makers, local manufacturers and their facilities should be formalized, supported, funded, and leveraged as a distributed emergency innovation and manufacturing response network. 

Open Source Medical Supplies has published a memo recommending the creation of a federally defined but state-activated network of facilities and volunteers—A U.S. Prototyping and Manufacturing Reserve (USPMR) 189 or a “Maker Corps.” Such a reserve force could be activated to solve breakdowns in supply chain channels and to augment traditional emergency response services by ensuring the availability of local rapid prototyping and production facilities, plus trained staff and volunteers in times of crisis. 

A federal interagency task force should determine standards for tiered certification, with levels indicating facility capabilities, and determine the lead administrative agency. USPMR members should reflect the range of responders who are and have been critical to addressing the COVID-19 medical supply chain emergency, from independent designers to community makerspaces to medium-scale manufacturers. Incentives to participate could include certification that enables faster access to state-allocated emergency funds during disasters; streamlined registration with the FDA as a Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) facility; and access to a USPMR aggregator program or cooperative which could market USPMR products and offer preferred contracting opportunities with state and national stockpiles, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), etc. Read the full proposal at osms.li/dayone.

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 76 2. Fund and Incentivize the Citizen Maker Response Network 

There are multiple opportunities to strengthen this ecosystem of open source innovators, whether or not an overarching reserve structure is articulated. Even with the creation of a USPMR or “Maker Corps”, incentives will be necessary to draw a robust range of qualified participants. 

Grant and capital improvement opportunities—especially for makerspaces, the central infrastructure of the Citizen Maker Response—are critical towards ensuring their capacity to respond in the future. Most unaffiliated makerspaces are key centers of learning, innovation and entrepreneurship in communities, and most exist on the edge of fiscal solvency. Investing in makerspaces will benefit not only evergreen goals of workforce and economic development, but also any future such emergency where a rapid innovation and fabrication response is needed. 

Funding of the Citizen Maker Response Network can be achieved via variety of mechanisms: 

● Providing access to a federally-funded / local-match revolving, forgivable loan funds, and/or New Markets Tax Credits that offer resources for facility capital improvements and capacity building. 

● Creating grant competition opportunities to serve as a workforce development and regional emergency response training and surge production center (a paid reserve function, similar to the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF)). Community colleges are ideal locations for these manufacturing-as-emergency response regional training and testing locations. 

● Investing in the creation of makerspaces in regions where there are none. 

● Building channels for communication and compensation between Citizen Maker Response groups and city and state emergency response agencies. Whether or not it is accomplished through an aforementioned USPMR registry, makerspaces and Citizen Maker Response entities (both individuals and groups) should not be invisible to government emergency response support when crisis occurs. One mechanism by which this could occur is the integration of maker community organizations (makerspaces, maker groups, and convening organizations like Nation of Makers and Open Source Medical Supplies) into the Volunteer/Community Organizations Active in Disaster (VOAD/COAD) network, enabling activation and support of these organizations in disaster. 

# 3. Create a U.S. Digital Stockpile 

OSMS’s Day One Project pape r190 additionally outlines a recommendation for the creation of a comprehensive library of open source medical supply “blueprints” — the U.S. Digital Stockpile.  

> 190 Sabrina Merlo, “Building Medical Supply Chain Resilience through a U.S. Manufacturing Reserve and Digital Stockpile,” Day One Project, November 17, 2020, https://www.dayoneproject.org/post/u-s-prototyping-manufacturing-reserve-u-s-digital-stockpile.

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 77 This will be an essential resource to the success of the aforementioned USPMR. Initial scope could be limited to medical supplies and devices, and later become a full repository of disaster response designs, such as for water filters or emergency shelters. Fabrication standards from ASTM, AAMI, NIOSH, and OSHA, including technical, regulatory , and disinfection standards for raw materials (both hard and soft), prior to their use in medical device manufacturing, should be an asset of the Digital Stockpile. The U.S. Digital Stockpile should be manufacturing-agnostic, involve a diversity of federal agencies and manufacturing institutes, include designs for low-resource environments, offer plain-language user guidance, and provide complete manufacturing requirements and testing guidance. 

# 4. Increase Opportunities for Crowdsourced Citizen Maker Innovation 

During the COVID-19 pandemic there were limited opportunities for maker engagement and participation in design and prototyping as a part of a formal government response to COVID-19. To this end, we recommend an expansion of Challenge programs (e.g., the VA’s COVID-19 Challenge referenced earlier), as well as an expansion of other mechanisms such as hackathons for individual knowledge bearers to transfer innovation expertise to both private and public sectors. A successful example of the latter occurred during the 2015 Ebola outbreak, when USAID convened a group of practitioners and makers from diverse areas to crowdsource ideation via hackathon to produce the best Ebola protective suit. The best design came from a wedding dress designer, who, through her ample experience with difficult custom gowns, was able to come up with a design that was streamlined, safe, and easy to remove. 191 

An additional mechanism to harness crowdsourced innovation could occur via a federal Maker-in-Residence Fellowship program ,192 placing innovators into temporary positions within the federal, state or local government. A Maker-in-Residence placed at the National Institutes of Health or Veterans Administration, could, for example, work with additional agencies to develop the infrastructure necessary to develop the Digital Stockpile.

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 78 5. Streamline Pathways with Regulators and Testing Facilities for Open Source Designs 

While the FDA’s EUA has enabled production of PPE by the Citizen Maker Response during COVID-19, there is currently no established formal regulatory guidance or approval pathway by which open source medical designs can be validated. The FDA should include dedicated staff to develop approval pathways for open source supplies and devices, and provide advance coordination of Emergency Use Authorizations aligned with Digital Stockpile designs and USPMR facilities. This new type of certification would reflect an understanding of the rigor of USPRM certification and be available to this trusted manufacturing network in times of crisis. Currently, technical testing standards vary based on lab equipment availability and brand, which reduces end user confidence in results. Incorporated into the new regulatory pathway involving the FDA and a USPMR should be the expectation that all testing facilities establish validation protocols and calibration tools for substantial testing equivalency ,

independent of geographic location. Additionally, a map of certified testing facilities, both independent and university-based, should be maintained as a resource in the Digital Stockpile. In times of declared crises, these facilities would operate as a distributed network with priority access for local manufacturers at little or no cost. USPMR regional hubs should have a minimum requirement to host a certified testing facility, with the understanding that testing access would be prioritized to USPMR and local Citizen Maker Response groups parallel to the signing of a Defense Production Act (DPA). 193 

Guidelines for analog testing, including particle filtration, fit, impact and permeability, should be a Digital Stockpile resource, with a requirement that USPMR regional hubs train members in this testing to guarantee ongoing program participation. Once a device is successfully tested within the USPMR network, it should be shared in real-time with other activated USPMR locations, potentially reducing regional manufacturing turnaround. 

# 6. Ensure Access to Raw Materials for PPE Production 

Consistent and affordable access to raw materials obstructed domestic pandemic response, with some imported source suppliers reporting a 500% cost increase for raw materials. 194 Many domestic raw suppliers struggled to keep up with demand, which is still affecting the woven plastics industry at the time of this writing. 195

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 79 Domestic PPE raw material manufacturers should be identified and federally contracted (similar to the SBA bidding contract system) 196 to constantly have a specified inventory available within a certain time frame. A primary distribution of this inventory to USPMR members (the Citizen Maker Response network) during declared crises would be included in the contracts. 

# 7. Reduce the Burden of Liability 

In the United States, Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection from civil lawsuits to people who voluntarily provide reasonable aid to those who are injured, ill, in danger, or otherwise incapacitated. 197 However, Good Samaritan laws only protect groups donating supplies. As described earlier in this report, the FDA EUAs helped to clarify the liability landscape for both medical institutions and the Citizen Maker Response, but the open source community moved very quickly to respond to the gap in supplies, and critical weeks went by without sufficient guidance. The Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness (PREP) Act 198 enacted on March 17, 2020 supported the Citizen Maker Response by reducing fear of liability 199 or litigation 200 for their product. The authors of this report are in support of the utilization of PREP Act issuances by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in future crises. 

However, in addition to this legislation, it is important that plain language guidance be provided to increase awareness of these policies that reduce the burden of liability on the Citizen Maker Response. For example, some makerspaces affiliated with larger entities (e.g., Colleges or Universities or corporations) reported being disincentivized or prevented from producing PPE by their insurers, thereby limiting the capacity of the Citizen Maker Response. This lack of clarity about liability supports the case for formalizing the network (i.e., the USPMR), providing a platform for knowledge sharing. 

# 8. Facilitate New Distribution and Delivery Pipelines 

The individual quantities of Citizen Maker Response-manufactured PPE are often small and unevenly distributed, creating a challenge and disincentive for large-scale distribution and

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 80 delivery partners to engage with these producers on an individual basis. Additionally, many of these producers do not have access to distribution and delivery partners if they are not already part of the traditional manufacturing community. Given the emergency response nature of the Citizen Maker Response, and the lack of established networks for distribution and delivery of citizen-manufactured PPE, it is imperative that new supply aggregators and distribution pipelines for domestic surge manufacturing are created and incentivized. 

Established private sector group purchasing organizations (GPOs) 201 could join and serve in supply chain emergencies (via the USPMR or similar manufacturing reserve effort) to aggregate and distribute quantities of supplies produced by Citizen Maker Response efforts. Alternatively, the USPMR itself could function as the supply aggregator, with FEMA, State emergency response agencies, and the U.S. National Stockpile providing demand. 

# 9. Guarantee and Support a Domestic Market 

"We need to support domestic production however we can, but U.S. labor just costs more. The hospitals can't stomach that cost. They just can't. But if we could get them subsidized, I think hospitals would love to order domestically, even pay a little more for it. But they just can't pay four and five times the price." — David Rainosek, MD, Associate Medical Director of St. Vincent Rehabilitation Hospital, Arkansas, United States 

Guaranteeing and supporting an American-Made solution for PPE and medical supplies is two-fold: requiring a willingness to pay more to fairly compensate for U.S. labor, as well as providing incentives large enough for pivoting manufacturers to justify the expense of investing in new technologies and equipment. The challenge of the U.S. market being able to offer even medium-term demand for domestic manufacturers who pivot to produce PPE is known to U.S. manufacturers. Many remember the H1N1 crisis in 2009, when manufacturers that ramped up PPE production were left without buyers when the crisis died down. 202 MIT’s report points out that even with state incentives, smaller firms were reluctant to commit extensive resources to pivot to a product line that might dry up as soon as the pandemic ended: “many firms who were willing to pivot to PPE production but concerned about uncertain demand in the near future were therefore unable to find a large enough market to guarantee profitability.” 203

DESIGN | MAKE | PROTECT 81 Recent news coverage of domestic N95 manufacturers who have pivoted or entered the market 204 during the COVID-19 pandemic proves the same point: domestically-produced PPE cannot compete with imports on cost. 

To increase national resilience to medical supply chain disruption, the U.S. Government must offer market subsidies and/or longer-term contracts to domestic manufacturers of PPE to ensure availability of high-quality and sufficient supply in pandemics and emergencies. This could include a requirement that all PPE for the Strategic National Stockpile 205 be domestically manufactured, similar to the Berry Amendment 206 and the Buy-American Statute, 207 which promote the purchase of U.S.-made goods for military and federal agencies, respectively. The Biden Administration’s "Made in All of America" Executive Order will help ensure this. 208 Other federal stockpiles, such as HHS, FEMA, and Veteran Affairs, would benefit from the same requirement, as they were depleted pre-pandemic due to 2018 tariff impositions. 209 Healthcare systems are supportive of potential regulations within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reimbursement framework that would support domestic manufacturing. 210
