Singaporean Jonathan Mok, 23, wrote on Facebook that he was set upon by a group of men and a woman as he walked along Oxford Street on Monday February 24.

Violence erupted after the group passed Mr Mok, who has been studying in the capital for two years, and one made a remark about coronavirus.

On Wednesday, the Metropolitan Police released CCTV images of four men they want to speak to.

This attack left the victim shaken and hurt. There's no room on our streets for this kind of violent behaviour and we are committed to finding the perpetrators.

Detective Sergeant Emma Kirby, Met Police 
In his account of the assault, Mr Mok described how, as he turned to face the group, one of the men said: "Don't you dare look at me", before launching an attack.

All of a sudden, the first punch was swung at my face and took me by surprise. When I was still shocked by the first hit, the guy delivered the second sucker punch.

Jonathan Mok
Any witnesses can call police on 101, quoting CAD 7522/feb24.
