Oct. 30 (UPI) -- The coronavirus situation continues to ease worldwide with a weekly 19% cases and 15% deaths drop, though two new Omicron subvariants have emerged, including in the United States.

Like last week, cases are rising significantly in only Japan and South Korea over seven days among nations with at least 25,000 infections. Hong Kong also reported a small gain last week after dropping the week before.

The the World Health Organization [COVID-19](https://www.upi.com/topic/COVID-19/ "COVID-19") advisory group has held off on designating XBB and BQ.1 as specific variants of concern.

"The two sublineages remain part of Omicron, which continues to be a variant of concern," the group said.

They have been detected in 35 countries with a 1.3% global prevalence.

"BQ.1 is showing a significant growth advantage over other circulating Omicron sublineages in many settings, including Europe and the U.S., and therefore warrants close monitoring," WHO said. "At this time there is no epidemiologic data to suggest an increase in disease severity."

Regarding XBB: "There has been a broad increase in prevalence of XBB in regional genomic surveillance, but it has not yet been consistently associated with an increase in new infections. While further studies are needed, the current data do not suggest there are substantial differences in disease severity for XBB infections."

The [European Center for Disease Prevention and Control](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/covid-19/country-overviews) has reclassified the Omicron variant sub-lineage BQ.1 as a variant of interest (VOI).

In the United States, BQ.1 is projected for the weekend ending Saturday to be responsible for 14% of cases and BQ.1.1 is responsible for 13.1%, [according to the CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/covidview/index.html). Omicron accounts for 100% of all new cases.

The [CDC noted](https://www.covid19treatmentguidelines.nih.gov/therapies/statement-on-omicron-subvariants/) they are likely to be resistant to monoclonal antibody drug bebtelovimab, tixagevimab plus cilgavimab (Evusheld) for BQ.1.1. Nirmatrelvir, remdesivir and molnupiravir (Paxolovid) are expected to be active against these subvariants.

"You know, as we know, this virus is constantly changing," President [Joe Biden](https://www.upi.com/topic/Joe_Biden/ "Joe Biden") said at a [briefing Tuesday](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/10/25/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-status-of-the-countrys-fight-against-covid-19-2/). New variants have emerged here in the U.S. and around the world.

"And the weather is getting colder. People will spend more time indoors. And contagious viruses, like COVID, are going to spread considerably more easily."

"For Americans over five years of age who are fully vaccinated, our nation's health experts recommend that they get the updated COVID vaccine once a year," Biden said Tuesday before getting his updated vaccine. "In other words, it's just like the flu shot.

"Now, some high-risk people, such as the elderly and immunocompromised, may need more than one COVID shot. But for most Americans, one COVID shot each year will be all they need.

"And if you get it, you're protected. And if you don't, you're putting yourself and other people at unnecessary risk."
