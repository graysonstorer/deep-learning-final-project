Ooops, he did it again.

On Tuesday, in a re-election campaign rally in a church, the[Dream City Church](https://dreamcitychurch.us/ "https://dreamcitychurch.us/"),U.S. President Donald Trump once again used the phrase “Kung Flu” when referring to the Covid-19 coronavirus. Yes, in a church. And listen to the cheers that erupted when the 74-year-old President used the term in his speech at, once again, a church, based in Phoenix, Arizona:

Stay classy, Dream City Church crowd.

This was “Kung Flu” part two, in a church. The 27,038-day-old Trump had used the same phrase just this past Saturday, during his campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. This video from _The Guardian_ showed exactly what the 3,862-week-old Trump said to the over 500 dozens of people that were present:

Gee, if you are Asian American and grew up in the U.S. when’s the first time you heard the phrase “Kung Flu” said to you? Pre-school? Elementary school? Betcha it wasn’t in a friendly way like “Kung Flu, I love you.” Rather it was probably more in a nasty way like “keep your dirty Kung Flu self away from us.”

Using the phrase “Kung Flu” probably ain’t going to drum up the best of memories among many Asian Americans. And it certainly won’t help with the fact that Asian Americans have been facing coronavirus-related discrimination and attacks even though they had little to do with the pandemic, [as I have covered previously for _Forbes_](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/05/26/covid-19-coronavirus-continues-to-expose-anti-asian-bigotry-how-to-stop-it/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/05/26/covid-19-coronavirus-continues-to-expose-anti-asian-bigotry-how-to-stop-it/"). It’s gotten so bad that the [#WashTheHate campaign](https://www.washthehate.com/ "https://www.washthehate.com/") was started. So much for last month being [Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month](https://asianpacificheritage.gov/about/ "https://asianpacificheritage.gov/about/").

So why did Trump use that phrase then? Well, during the Tulsa rally, he claimed that Covid-19 is a disease that “without question has had more names than any other disease in history.” Umm, if that were correct, then how would it help to use yet another name that no real public health or infectious disease expert is using? And why didn’t Trump use some other example like:

Yeah, maybe “boomer remover” wouldn’t have gotten quite the same cheer in Tulsa.

Plus when it comes to unofficial names, plenty of diseases have had many more than Covid-19. Take syphilis, for example. (Metaphorically, of course, and not literally as you don’t want syphilis.) A Google search reveals that the unofficial names for syphillis range from something like a television channel (“syfy”) to something like sliding on a carpet (“Mississippi rug burn”). Will Trump mention the “Mississippi rug burn” the next time he is campaigning in that state?

So what’s the real reason Trump used the phrase? Well, during the White House Press Briefing on Monday, different reporters asked White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany repeatedly to explain why Trump used the term. _CBS News_ White House Correspondent Weijia Jiang led off the queries by saying, “Last July, President Trump declared himself the least racist person there is anywhere in the world. Why does he use racist phrases like ‘kung flu?’” After all, using the word “kung flu” probably isn’t going to help you on the official “least racist” world rankings or the racism Olympics.

Did McEnany provide a direct answer or did she do an Average Joe’s Gym from the movie _Dodge Ball_ and dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge? Well, you can see for yourself in this video from _The Guardian_:

To Jiang’s initial question, McEnany responded, “The president doesn’t,” which is an interesting thing to say because the video of the Tulsa speech kind of suggests that he did. In this case, “kind of suggests” means that it showed him using the phrase.

After repeated questioning, McEnany did claim that Trump’s use of the phrase “Kung Flu” was “linking it [the virus] to its place of origin.” That’s interesting. Have studies suggested that the virus originated in a martial arts studio? Did it come from the song “Kung” by Phish?

McEnany, who doesn’t appear to be Asian American, did not even acknowledge that the use of “kung-flu” could be offensive to at least some people. After all, plenty of people have said that it’s offensive such as, drum roll please, these Asian Americans:

And this Asian American:

And even White House advisor Kelly Anne Conway, who is married to an Asian American and did agree that use of such a term is “highly offensive” as seen in this _Now This_ video:

Instead, McEnany used the opportunity to justify the use of the words “Chinese virus” and “Wuhan virus,” even though those terms also goes counter to the “[World Health Organization (WHO) Best Practices for the Naming of New Human Infectious Diseases](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/163636/WHO_HSE_FOS_15.1_eng.pdf;jsessionid=779090C041667F136768867C234DA4BE?sequence=1 "https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/163636/WHO_HSE_FOS_15.1_eng.pdf;jsessionid=779090C041667F136768867C234DA4BE?sequence=1").” The WHO released these guidelines in 2015 because using geographic locations or cultural or population references in naming new diseases could “provoke a backlash against members of particular religious or ethnic communities.” A backlash? WHO? What? Could something like that actually happen?

To prevent such a backlash, you could always use the real names for the disease and the virus. After all, Covid-19 is not that difficult to pronounce like Snuffleupagus. Heck the word Covid has fewer syllables than the word Ivanka. Just add the number 19 at the end because the virus first appeared in 2019, which is the year before 2020, in case anyone in the crowd at the Dream City Church was wondering.

So back to original question? Why has Trump now on two separate occasions used a phrase that kids have used to bully Asian Americans, when there are official names that are fairly easy to remember and pronounce, when people have repeatedly asked why he is using the phrase?

Could it be to find someone to blame for the Covid-19 coronavirus? Could it be to find someone to blame for the over 121K Covid-19 deaths that have already occurred in the U.S., by far the most of any country? Could it be looking for someone to blame for the economic hardships that have resulted because the virus was not contained earlier in the U.S., which ended up requiring more severe social distancing measures in the U.S. than in countries such as Taiwan, South Korea, and Germany? Could it be to deflect from the criticism of the handling of Covid-19 coronavirus response?

Finding someone else to blame is a strategy that you can use when you do something wrong, you make a mistake, you have a really bad ooops moment. It happened, for example, in the 1970’s when Japanese auto manufacturers began surpassing American auto makers. Instead of taking a hard look at why the Detroit Big Three auto companies were not developing better management practices and cars to keep up with the times, many Americans blamed the Japanese for the ensuing woes. And when any people that “look Asian” are blamed, all Asian Americans (well, at least those of East Asian and some of Southeast Asian descent) can end up suffering. [As I have written before for _Forbes_](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/02/18/how-covid-19-coronavirus-is-uncovering-anti-asian-racism/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2020/02/18/how-covid-19-coronavirus-is-uncovering-anti-asian-racism/"), people in the U.S. may not distinguish between those in Asia and Asian Americans. Heck, [as I described in an essay](https://milkeninstitute.org/power-of-ideas/racism-never-solves-problem "https://milkeninstitute.org/power-of-ideas/racism-never-solves-problem") for the [Milken Institute’s Power of Ideas series](https://milkeninstitute.org/power-of-ideas#:~:text=The%20Power%20of%20Ideas%20series,driving%20shared%20prosperity%2C%20and%20more "https://milkeninstitute.org/power-of-ideas#:~:text=The%20Power%20of%20Ideas%20series,driving%20shared%20prosperity%2C%20and%20more"), even if you were born and grew up in the U.S. and have never ever been to China and have no real roots in China, people may still tell you to “go back to China.”

Finding someone to blame and failing to distinguish among those of Asian descent are why Vincent Chin was killed in 1982. Ironically this had occurred on June 23, exactly 38 years before Trump’s Phoenix rally. Two American auto workers took out their job situation frustrations on Chin, a random Chinese American, rather than on their companies’ executives. They beat Chin to death. Chin wasn’t even of Japanese descent, probably because no one bothered paying attention to differences among different Asian Americans. To add to the tragedy, this incident didn’t get the attention that it deserved and the two perpetrators never served any jail time for the crime, as this segment on _Detroit Public TV_ showed:

That’s just one tragic example from a long history of Asian Americans getting scapegoated.

Did the cheers at the rally following Trump’s utterance of “Kung Flu” suggest that a scapegoat has successfully been found? If so, that’s bad news all around, except maybe the virus. It’s bad for Asian Americans who have to bear the brunt of hatred for mistakes that weren’t their fault. It’s bad for this country because such prejudice may keep Asian American public health experts, scientists, and others from helping this country deal with the pandemic. It’s bad for this country because it distracts from the mistakes that continue to be made in this country’s pandemic response and from finding appropriate solutions. And all of those are much more than just ooopses.
