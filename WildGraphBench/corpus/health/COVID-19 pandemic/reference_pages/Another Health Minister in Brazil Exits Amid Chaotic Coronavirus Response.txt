The new health minister, Nelson Teich, quit after four weeks, deepening the coronavirus crisis in Brazil, where the death rate is rising and the president wants people to return to work now.

RIO DE JANEIRO — The [Brazilian](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-supreme-court.html) government’s chaotic response to the coronavirus pandemic worsened Friday as its latest [health minister](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/22/world/brazil-health-minister-un-covid.html) quit barely a month into the job, with daily deaths from infection climbing and a defiant president exhorting people to get back to work.

The departure of the health minister, Nelson Teich, who took over just four weeks ago after the termination of his predecessor, threatened to compound the political upheaval that has called into question the ability of the president, [Jair Bolsonaro](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/world/americas/brazil-bolsonaro-supreme-court.html), to govern Latin America’s largest country.

With upward of 800 people dying each day from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, Brazil’s death rate is now second only to that of the United States. Lax quarantine measures are leading to rising contagion as Mr. Bolsonaro urges Brazilian workers to effectively defy local lockdown orders from states and municipalities.

Mr. Teich, an oncologist with no political experience, stepped into the job on April 17 after the president fired Luiz Henrique Mandetta, a pediatric orthopedist and politician, following a weekslong standoff.

Mr. Mandetta defended quarantine measures that several governors and mayors had imposed in mid-March to curb the spread of the pandemic. Mr. Bolsonaro railed against them, calling them economically ruinous.

During a news conference Friday afternoon, Mr. Teich did not provide a reason for his resignation.

“Life is made up of choices, and today I chose to leave,” he said. “I didn’t accept the job for the position itself. I accepted it because I thought I could help the country and its people.”
