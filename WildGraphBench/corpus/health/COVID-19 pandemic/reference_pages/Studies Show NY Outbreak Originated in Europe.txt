Coronavirus in New York came mainly from Europe, studies show.
--------------------------------------------------------------

[New research indicates](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html) that [the coronavirus](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/podcasts/the-daily/coronavirus-new-orleans.html) began to circulate in the New York area by mid-February, weeks before the first confirmed case, and that it was brought to the region mainly by travelers from Europe, not Asia.

“The majority is clearly European,” said Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who co-wrote a study awaiting peer review.

A separate team at N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine came to strikingly similar conclusions, despite studying a different group of cases. Both teams analyzed genomes from [coronaviruses](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/world/europe/eu-coronavirus-vaccine.html) taken from New Yorkers starting in mid-March.
