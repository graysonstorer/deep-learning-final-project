**The Latest:** Delaware has postponed its presidential primary election for a second time, moving it to July 7.

As the coronavirus pandemic [upends the presidential campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/us/politics/coronavirus-2020-campaign.html), states across the country have postponed primary elections and expanded vote-by-mail options, citing the difficulty of holding elections during the outbreak.

One state, [New York](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/nyregion/ny-house-primaries.html), attempted to cancel its already-postponed presidential primary after the Democratic presidential race was settled, but a federal judge [ordered that the election go forward](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/us/politics/ny-presidential-primary.html) in June.

Fifteen other states and two territories — Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Wyoming, and Guam and [Puerto Rico](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/us/puerto-rico-election.html) — have either pushed back their presidential primaries or switched to voting by mail with extended deadlines.

Some states have even postponed their primaries multiple times.

Several states have now conducted contests during stay-at-home orders, with many voters casting ballots by mail but some participating in person. Wisconsin [forged ahead with its elections](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/politics/wisconsin-election-coronavirus.html) on April 7 after state Republicans blocked efforts to postpone voting there.

The remaining presidential primaries have been rendered largely irrelevant since Bernie Sanders [dropped out of the Democratic race](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/us/politics/bernie-sanders-drops-out.html) on April 8, establishing Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the presumptive nominee. But Mr. Sanders still wants to collect delegates to the national convention, which was [rescheduled](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/us/politics/milwaukee-democratic-convention-delayed.html) from mid-July to mid-August. Some states also have local elections coming up.

Here’s a running update of major changes in an election transformed, including rescheduled primaries and caucuses and a few other key races. You can also track our [full primary election calendar](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/us/elections/2020-presidential-election-calendar.html).

:

Because of an editing error, a heading in an earlier version of this article misstated the deadline for Hawaii Democrats to return ballots in the party’s presidential primary election. As the article correctly noted, the new deadline is May 22, not April 22.
