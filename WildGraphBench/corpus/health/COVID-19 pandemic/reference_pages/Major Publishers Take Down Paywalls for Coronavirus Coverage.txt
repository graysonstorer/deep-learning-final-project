============================================================

An interesting decision as some organizations have recently instituted them

[Midterm elections](https://twitter.com/nytimespr/status/1059789949338300418?lang=en), [massive snowstorms](https://www.poynter.org/reporting-editing/2013/new-york-times-to-drop-paywall-for-storm-coverage/) and now coronavirus. Those are the coverage areas so important to the public that publications have been willing to make articles about these things free to read.

U.S.-based media organizations [have been tasked](https://www.adweek.com/agencies/how-the-coronavirus-is-disrupting-the-global-advertising-industry/) with bending to the quick-moving whims of coronavirus all week as more cases of the virus are discovered in the U.S., working to give guidelines to journalists on best reporting practices [as they repackage](https://www.adweek.com/digital/new-york-times-magazine-changes-process-coronavirus/) and [create new products](https://www.adweek.com/digital/media-orgs-ramp-up-coverage-of-coronavirus-determine-protocol-for-staffers/) to [address the widespread pandemic](https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/ad-tech-companies-not-hurting-coronavirus-keyword-blacklisting/). Most news organizations, especially those with New York City as its headquarters, have even encouraged—if not required—staffers to work from home if they can.
