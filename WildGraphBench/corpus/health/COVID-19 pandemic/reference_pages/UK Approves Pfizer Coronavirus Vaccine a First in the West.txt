The emergency approval, ahead of the United States and the European Union, clears the way for Britain to begin mass inoculations. “Help is on its way,” one official said.

LONDON — Britain gave emergency authorization on Wednesday to [Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/us/politics/trump-pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine.html), leaping ahead of the United States to become the first Western country to allow [mass inoculations](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/08/world/covid-19-coronavirus#pfizers-vaccine-debuts-in-britain-as-the-worlds-first-fully-tested-vaccine) against a disease that has killed more than 1.4 million people worldwide.

The decision cleared the way for a [vaccination campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/world/europe/coronavirus-vaccine-uk-questions.html) with little precedent in modern medicine, encompassing not only ultracold dry ice but also a crusade against anti-vaccine misinformation.

Britain’s beating the United States to authorization — on a [vaccine](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/22/well/family/covid-vaccine-pregnancy.html) codeveloped by an American company, no less — intensified pressure on U.S. regulators, who are [under fire from the White House](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/01/world/covid-19-coronavirus/the-white-house-summons-the-head-of-the-fda-to-explain-why-the-pfizer-vaccine-has-not-received-approval) for not moving faster to get doses to people. But it also fueled concerns that Britain was acting in haste for political reasons or trying to muscle its way to the front of the line for deliveries.

[European regulators](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/21/world/europe/eu-coronavirus-vaccine.html) on Wednesday cast doubt on the rigor of Britain’s review and said that the authorization was limited to specific batches of the vaccine, a claim that Pfizer denied and British officials did not address.

Britain’s move provoked a spirited debate among American scientists about whether U.S. regulators, who are known to be unusually meticulous, could afford to hold off any longer on authorizing a vaccine against a virus that is claiming more than 10,000 lives a day worldwide.
