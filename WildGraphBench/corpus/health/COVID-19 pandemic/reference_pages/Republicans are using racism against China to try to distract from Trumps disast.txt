President Donald Trump and his Republican allies are using racism to try to distract from his disastrous preparations for and response to the coronavirus pandemic. Instead of taking responsibility for and addressing early failures, they're blaming the crisis on China.

In a matter of weeks, Trump has shifted from applauding China for its response to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, to insisting on referring to the virus as the "Chinese virus." The virus originated in Wuhan, China, but has spread to [at least 160 countries and territories.](https://www.businessinsider.com/coronavirus-cases-maps-us-world-spread-symptoms-death-rate-2020-1)

Trump in late January tweeted: "China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi!"

> —Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) [January 24, 2020](https://twitter.com/mims/statuses/1220818115354923009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

But fast-forward to a White House press conference on Thursday, and the president was singing a different tune.

"We continue our relentless effort to defeat the Chinese virus," Trump said at the start of the briefing.

Trump insisted that China is to blame for the pandemic.

"It could have been contained to that one area in China where it started and certainly the world is paying a very big price for what they did," Trump said.

Trump says 'I know the truth'
-----------------------------

China has faced [widespread criticism](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/02/08/803766743/critics-say-china-has-suppressed-and-censored-information-in-coronavirus-outbrea) over efforts to suppress information during the outbreak, but its aggressive and authoritarian efforts to combat the virus also appear to have paid off. Thursday was the first time China has reported [no new domestic coronavirus infections](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-no-new-local-coronavirus-cases-first-time-during-outbreak-2020-3) since the outbreak began.

China has reported nearly 81,000 cases of the novel coronavirus, and 3,100 deaths.

When asked if he believed the report about no new infections in China during a Thursday press conference — in which he spread false information about a potential treatment for coronavirus — Trump said, "I hope it's true."

The press conference wrapped up with the right-wing One America News Network's White House correspondent baselessly attacking mainstream media outlets for "siding with foreign state propaganda" over Trump amid the pandemic.

Trump replied, "It amazes me when I read the things that I read. It amazes me when I read The Wall Street Journal, which is always so negative. It amazes me when I read the — I don't even read The New York Times, we don't distribute it in the White House anymore and the same thing with The Washington Post."

"Because you see, I know the truth," [Trump said.](https://www.businessinsider.com/oan-reporter-prompts-trump-to-attack-media-during-coronavirus-briefing-2020-3) "And people out there in the world, they really don't know the truth. They don't know what it is."
