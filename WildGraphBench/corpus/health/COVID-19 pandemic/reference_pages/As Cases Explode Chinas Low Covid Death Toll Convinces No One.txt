# As Cases Explode, China's Low Covid Death Toll Convinces No One

China’s murky statistics are fueling widespread public distrust. Its narrow definition of Covid deaths “will very much underestimate the true death toll,” the W.H.O. says.

The hearses bearing black and yellow funeral paper flowers crept in a steady stream toward the Dongjiao crematory in eastern Beijing. Several dozen people crowded around the closed gate waiting to be let in. A man unable to get a spot in line could only watch, wondering what to do with the body of a relative who had just died of Covid.

The hospital could not keep the body — there were already too many in its morgue. When he called the crematory, an employee told him he had to wait a week. When he called again, nobody answered.

A country trying to mourn its dead from an explosive Covid outbreak is grappling with a system unprepared for the surge in fatalities. Two weeks after China abruptly abandoned its “zero Covid” policy, cases have soared in cities like Beijing, along with reports of people dying.

Funeral home directors and sellers of funeral supplies describe a flood of phone calls from families needing help handling the bodies of relatives. On Chinese social media, people are sharing videos and photos of morgues crowded with bodies, as well as their own personal accounts of losing loved ones to the outbreak.

But China’s government is painting a less dire picture. In its official statistics and propaganda reports, China has acknowledged only seven deaths from Covid in the past two weeks, and only in Beijing. The National Health Commission even reduced the country’s cumulative Covid death toll on Wednesday by one, to 5,241. Officials have explained that China counts Covid deaths only if the virus was the direct cause of a respiratory failure — a definition the World Health Organization said would lead to a vast underestimate.

The ruling Communist Party may have a political incentive to downplay the toll of an epidemic it [has suddenly stopped trying to control](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/19/world/asia/china-zero-covid-xi-jinping.html). Xi Jinping, China’s top leader, has portrayed his country’s earlier success in limiting Covid deaths as evidence of China’s superiority over the West, a claim that would be hard to maintain with numerous deaths.
