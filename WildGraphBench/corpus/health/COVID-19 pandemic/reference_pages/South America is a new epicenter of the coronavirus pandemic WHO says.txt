WHO officials say South America a ‘new epicenter’ of coronavirus pandemic

[Coronavirus](https://www.cnbc.com/coronavirus/)

The epicenter of the global [Covid-19 pandemic](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/22/coronavirus-live-updates.html) has shifted to South America as cases in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo explode six months after the new coronavirus emerged on the other side of the world in Wuhan, China, the World Health Organization declared Friday.

“We’ve seen many South American countries with increasing numbers of cases and clearly there’s a concern across many of those countries, but certainly the most affected is Brazil at this point,”Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO’s emergencies program, said at a news briefing from the agency’s Geneva headquarters.

“In a sense, South America has become a new epicenter for the disease,” he said.

Brazil has more cases than any other country in South America, according to the [WHO’s most recent daily situation report.](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/20200521-covid-19-sitrep-122.pdf?sfvrsn=24f20e05_2)Ryan said confirmed cases in the country are now approaching 300,000 and Covid-19 has now killed nearly 19,000 people in Brazil.

Ryan noted that the government of Brazil has approved the “broader” use of anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which U.S. President [Donald Trump](https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/) has said he is currently taking to defend against infection from Covid-19. Several studies have cast doubt on the efficacy of the drug as a treatment for the disease. [A study published earlier Friday](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/22/coronavirus-patients-treated-with-trump-touted-hydroxychloroquine-at-higher-risk-of-death-new-study-says.html) showed that patients who were treated with the drug had a higher risk of death than those who didn’t take it.

“The current clinical evidence does not support the widespread use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of Covid-19, not until the trials are completed and we have clearer results,” Ryan said.

The majority of cases in Brazil are in the Sao Paulo region, Ryan said, adding that the states of Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Amazonas and Pernambuco have been affected as well. He said the WHO is actively providing assistance to the government of Brazil.

“In terms of attack rates, the highest attack rates are actually in Amazonas,” Ryan said. “About 490 persons infected per 100,000 population, which is quite a high attack rate.”

The state of [Amozonas, which is among Brazil’s most rural states, warned last month](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-brazil-amazon/brazils-amazonas-state-warns-its-health-system-overwhelmed-by-coronavirus-idUSKCN21R3L3) that its health system was overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients. Dr.Maria Van Kerkhove, head of the WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonosis unit, emphasized the importance for all countries to protect at-risk populations.

“All countries have vulnerable populations and we are seeing a greater impact in terms of disease, disease severity, poor outcomes in groups that are vulnerable,” she said. “It highlights the inequalities that we see in vulnerable groups.”

In March, the WHO declared that the epicenter of the virus had left China, where it first emerged, [and arrived in Europe](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/13/europe-is-now-the-epicenter-of-the-coronavirus-pandemic-who-says.html). The virus has now infected more 5.1 million people around the world and killed at least 335,063 people, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Some [states](https://www.versantprivacy.com/privacy#accordionheader5) provide residents (or their authorized agents) with the right to opt out of these practices. See the “[Your Rights](https://www.versantprivacy.com/privacy#accordionheader5)” section of our Privacy Policy for more info.

**If you reside in one of these states (or are an authorized agent) you can opt out of targeted advertising, selling, or sharing, occurring on this site by moving the toggle below to the left and clicking “Confirm My Choice.”** Your choice through the toggle is specific to this site. If you access other Versant sites and services, you will need to opt out for each. Also, if you clear your cookies on this browser or use another browser or device, you will need to opt out again. You can change your choice any time.

**In addition to the toggle, you should also provide the information requested in our “Opt-Out Form” (accessible by clicking the “+” below), which will enable us to take action on your opt-out election more broadly than just on this site (e.g., we will be able to stop sharing your email with third parties in order to target you with adverting on other site and services, such as social media platforms).**

You may also enable where available and provided for under applicable privacy laws, a universal tool that automatically communicates your opt out preference, such as the Global Privacy Control (“GPC”). If detected, we will process your GPC signal as if you had opted out through the toggle.

If you opt-out, you may continue to see advertising, including ads that may be based on personal information processed before you opted out.
