*   NATURE BRIEFING
*   01 November 2022

Some people in China are breathing in their booster doses. Plus, scientists in Brazil widely welcome the election of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as president, and there is evidence that early-career biomedical scientists are more innovative and creative.

Many scientists breathed a sigh of relief on Sunday as [Brazil narrowly elected Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva as president](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03523-9). “Today is a very hopeful day here in Brazil,” says chemist Elisa Orth. “We voted for somebody who believes in science, who believes in education.” Although Lula came out on top in the election, Bolsonaro’s supporters prevailed in many of the congressional elections that took place on 2 October, which means the incoming president will face hurdles when implementing his agenda.

Some residents of Shanghai, China, are inhaling their COVID-19 boosters. The vaccine, produced by biotechnology firm CanSino Biologics, is a mist that is sucked through the mouthpiece of a sealed cup — in what might be [the first roll-out of a needle-free COVID-19 vaccine](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3197350/coronavirus-could-china-inhale-its-way-out-zero-covid-restrictions-oral-inoculations). “It was like drinking a cup of milk tea,” said one person in an online video posted by a state media outlet. “When I breathed it in, it tasted a bit sweet.” Developers hope that vaccines that prime immune cells in the mucous membranes that live in the nose and mouth, where SARS-CoV-2 enters the body, will quickly stop the virus from spreading, preventing even mild cases and blocking transmission. More than 100 oral or nasal vaccines are in development globally.

A study of 5.6 million papers finds that [early-career biomedical scientists are more innovative and creative than their more senior peers](https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/younger-scientists-are-more-innovative-study-finds-70700?utm_content=226478441&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-18198832). Researchers looked at authors’ academic positions, whether a paper cited fresh findings from a wide range of fields and how many times the paper was cited by others. The evidence is particularly salient because biomedicine relies heavily on grant funding, where older, established scientists tend to have the edge, says economist and study coauthor Gerald Marschke.

### WEBB’S WORLD: NOTES FROM THE CHIEF MAGAZINE EDITOR

![Image 2: Headshot of a middle-aged Caucasian man with short, greying hair, set against a green foliage background](https://media.nature.com/lw767/magazine-assets/d41586-022-03548-0/d41586-022-03548-0_23666242.png)

Doing science can take courage. In many parts of the world, researchers are facing increasing hostility and threats to their personal safety while attempting to inject evidence into public debates and better the lives of others.

That’s why _Nature_, together with the UK-based charity Sense about Science, organizes the John Maddox Prize to publicize the work of scientists in particularly challenging contexts. At a ceremony in London last week, it was my honour to [hand this year’s award to a truly courageous researcher, Eucharia Oluchi Nwaichi](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-63416721).

A biochemist and soil scientist at the University of Port Harcourt in Nigeria, she has spent the past decade and more working with local communities to clean up oil pollution in the Niger Delta. This is a region marked by often violent confrontation between oil companies and local communities, and Nwaichi’s work has seen her abused, threatened and detained without cause. But by slowly winning the trust of both sides, she has managed to spearhead remediation efforts and help to ensure a healthier, harmonious existence for people living in the area — an inspiring case of science done for the common good.

Africa doesn’t have one single path to low-carbon development: each country has different starting points and uncertainties when it comes to using renewables or fossil fuels. For example, Ethiopia is headed for an accelerated green-growth pathway, but Mozambique is at a crossroads of natural-gas expansion. [An interdisciplinary group of authors, most of whom are African,](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-022-01152-0) outlines how to identify the ways forward for specific countries on the continent.

Surveys taken every five years reveal how the coral reefs around Barbados are changing, says ecologist Henri Vallès. “Barbados no longer has populations of large fish, such as groupers and snappers, because of overfishing,” he says. “And numbers of sponges and algae, which can damage corals when too abundant, have gradually increased in the deeper reefs.” [Still, there are positive signs](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03480-3). “The populations of parrotfish, Barbados’s most important species ecologically and economically, have seemed stable for the past decade…. [and] Staghorn corals (_Acropora cervicornis_), which nearly went extinct here in the 1970s, are making a slow comeback.” ([Nature | 3 min read](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03480-3))
