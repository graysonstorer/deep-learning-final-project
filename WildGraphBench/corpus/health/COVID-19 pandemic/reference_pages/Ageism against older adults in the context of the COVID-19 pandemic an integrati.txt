----------------------------------------------------------------

### OBJECTIVE

To report the main results of studies on prejudice, stereotyping, and age-based discrimination (ageism) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

### METHODS

This is an integrative review of the literature on ageism in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, conducted between May and June 2020, with data collected from the following databases: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE/PubMed), Web of Science (Thompson Reuters), Scopus (Elsevier Science), _Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde_ (Lilacs) and Scientific Eletronic Library Online (SciELO).

### RESULTS

Twenty-one publications addressing ageism during the pandemics, its origins, consequences, and ethical and political implications were analyzed. All publications were theoretical with a critical/reflexive approach, being 90,5% opinion articles (n = 19) and 9,5% research (n = 2). The main findings indicate criticisms regarding resources allocation and intensive care based exclusively on age. The results also highlight the impacts of social isolation, the use of technologies and social media, and intergenerational relationships within the COVID-19 scenario.

### CONCLUSION

According to most publications, although ageism has always been present, it became more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic as a form of discrimination against older adults. “Ageist” discourses may exert a negative influence in older adults’ lives, causing severe social and psychological impacts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

In December 2019, a severe respiratory disease of unknown etiology was detected in the city of Wuhan, China. Later on, it was identified as an infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 or Sars-Cov-2) and named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B1). Due to the rapid spread of the virus and the growing number of cases worldwide, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11, 2020[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B2).

The novel coronavirus pandemic is one of the biggest public health issues over the last century, posing challenges such as the implementation of measures that ensure social health protection and minimize economic and social damage while respecting human rights[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B3). Although everyone is susceptible to the disease, countries with older populations have felt the impacts of the pandemic in a larger scale, especially regarding morbidity and mortality. Studies show that older adults are at higher risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19, possibly leading to death[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B4). Among other factors, this may be explained by immunosenescence – a process characterized by the gradual deterioration of the immune system and the consequent increased susceptibility to infections[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B6). Besides age, the high prevalence of multimorbidity, frailty, and inflammatory changes make this age group more vulnerable and may complicate the disease course[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B7).

As a measure to contain the pandemic expansion, the WHO suggested all countries to adopt social distancing measures to contain virus spread, prevent health systems collapse, and reduce the number of victims of COVID-19[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B8). However, this strategy may generate negative impacts in various segments of society. Bezerra et al.[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B9) conducted an opinion survey on perceived social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil (n = 16,440) and found social interaction to be the most affected aspect, followed by financial condition.

Global health authorities then began to recommend other strategies to reduce virus transmission, such as prohibiting agglomerations, restricting movement, and limiting contact with special populations (as in long-term institutions, such as prisons). Such measures incur social, economic, and health-related consequences[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B10).

Various age groups may be vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19 control and preventive measures, including the social distancing and isolation stemming from them. Nowadays, older adults are increasingly likely to live alone and have fewer opportunities for social interaction[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B11), besides going out less often for social, recreational, religious, and utilitarian activities due to mobility difficulties and inadequate environmental conditions. This population also uses less online communication systems to inform themselves, shop, contact other people, and have fun when compared to younger individuals. With that, older adults are particularly exposed to the risks arising from social isolation and loneliness enforced by social distancing measures[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B12),[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B13).

Social isolation is the absence of social contact or communication, participation in social activities, or confidants contact, increasing the risk of death by almost one third (OR = 1.29)[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B14). Often associated with social isolation[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B13),[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B15), emotional loneliness is a personal experience of lack of significant social connections that evokes negative emotions such as disinterest, boredom, fatigue, and apathy, besides potentiating pain, sleep disorders, decreased appetite, and physical inactivity. Together, the consequences of social isolation and emotional loneliness in older adults increase their vulnerability to depression and risk of death[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B15),[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B16).

The COVID-19 pandemic and the consequent risk of overloading health systems in some countries and regions sparked discussions on health resources allocation primarily to young and adult patients. This possibility provoked and fueled the controversy surrounding fundamental ethical issues, including the right to life and professional’s decision on who lives and who dies[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B17). Concurrently, derogatory memes, negative stereotypes, and biased discourses against older adults featured on the Internet, media, and social networks, evincing age-based discrimination in society[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B18).

That is, the pandemic brought to light the issue of prejudice toward older populations, which is not recent in history. The term “ageism” was first used in 1969 by the American psychiatrist and gerontologist Robert Butler to designate the prejudice by one age group toward other age groups, or as any form of stereotyping and discriminating people based on their chronological age[19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B19). Robert Butler also emphasizes ageism essential vocations – being oriented toward older adults and including systematic processes of stereotyping and discriminating people due to their age. The author classified ageism as a form of intolerance comparable to sexism and racism. Six years later, he refined the concept by stating that ageism includes biased attitudes toward older people, old age, and the aging process; discriminative social practices against older adults; and institutional practices and policies that perpetuate stereotypes against these age groups[20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B20).

Ageism may be perpetuated against young people and adults[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B21),[22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B22), but most theoretical studies and research on the theme focus on older adults. This is particularly true regarding the treatment provided to older populations during the COVID-19 pandemic, considering this group greater biological vulnerability and lower political power when compared to younger groups. The term ageism was translated to Brazilian Portuguese as _discriminação por idade, etarismo,_ or _ageismo,_ and recorded in the list of Descriptors of Health Sciences (DeCS) of the Latin American & Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (Lilacs) and the Virtual Health Library (VHL).

Considering aging as a complex, dynamic, and heterogeneous process, discrimination against older adults and age-based stigmatization have been more evident in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring major ethical and political discussions. This review sought to describe the main results of studies on prejudice, stereotyping, and age-based discrimination (ageism) in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321)METHODS
---------------------------------------------------------------

The integrative literature review is a methodological approach used to provide knowledge on a given theme in a systematic, orderly, and comprehensive manner. It is organized into six phases: identifying the theme, hypothesis, or research question; identifying in the literature pre-established search criteria; defining information to be extracted from selected studies/categorizing studies; evaluating studies critically; interpreting results; and presenting the review/synthesis of knowledge[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B23).

This study conducted a literature search on national and international journals addressing age discrimination (ageism) against older adults in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Between May 1 and June 15, 2020, two independent researchers conducted the electronic search in to the following databases: Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE/PubMed), Web of Science (Thompson Reuters), Scopus (Elsevier Science), Lilacs, and the Scientific Eletronic Library Online (SciELO). To solve divergences, a third researcher was consulted for an opinion on whether to include or not the selected publications.

Descriptors were used according to the Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) and its Portuguese equivalents, provided by the Descriptors in Health Sciences (DeCS). The search strategy, elaborated for each database, comprised terms combined using the Boolean operators “AND” and “OR.” The following terms were used as descriptors for database search: covid-19 OR 2019 novel coronavirus disease OR covid19 OR covid-19 pandemic OR SARS-CoV-2 infection OR covid-19 virus disease OR 2019 novel coronavirus infection OR 2019-nCoV infection OR coronavirus disease 2019 OR coronavirus disease-19 OR 2019-nCoV disease OR covid-19 virus infection AND Ageism OR Discrimination OR Age Discriminations OR Discrimination, Age OR Discriminations, Act.

All publications approaching ageism in older adults (people aged ≥ 60 years) and its impacts on the COVID-19 pandemic were eligible for inclusion. We applied no restrictions regarding year, methodological design, or language. Articles discussing ageism in age groups below 60 years or unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic were excluded. Publications duplicated in different databases were considered only once.

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321)RESULTS
---------------------------------------------------------------

The initial search identified 43 publications based on the title. After title and abstract screening, 21 were excluded for being duplicate or unrelated to the theme of interest. Twenty-two studies were selected for full-text reading, from which one was excluded after consultation by the third researcher for not addressing ageism in the pandemic as main theme. Thus, this integrative review comprised 21 articles. Of these, 18 were identified in the MEDLINE/Pubmed, seven in the Web of Science, four in the VHL/Lilacs, and three in Scopus. Some articles were published in two or more databases. [Figure](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#f01) 1 shows the flowchart outlining the process for selecting the publications.

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PubMed, Web of Science | Journal of Clinical Nursing | Brooke et al., 2020 18 | Older people and COVID-19: isolation, risk and ageism b | Editorial | It addresses social isolation, risks, and ageism during COVID-19. | Biased, negative, and implicitly devaluing discourses contribute for older adults to feel useless, burdensome, and valueless, diminishing their social opportunities and making them vulnerable to negative social and health outcomes, especially isolation and loneliness. |
| PubMed, BVS, Scopus, Web of Science | Journal of the American Medical Directors Association | Cesari et al., 2020 24 | COVID-19 in Italy: Ageism and decision making in a pandemic b | Editorial | It criticizes ethical and clinical guidelines regarding the allocation of scarce intensive care resources based on the age criterion during the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. | Conducts driven only by the number of years lived configure ageism. Critical and rapid decision-making in older people’s health require parameters more robust than age, including frailty, comorbidities, and functional status. |
| PubMed, Web of Science | Journal of the American Geriatrics Society | Jimenez-Sotomayor et al., 2020 25 | Coronavirus, ageism, and twitter: an evaluation of tweets about older adults and COVID -19 a | Qualitative research | It analyzes tweets related to older adults and COVID-19 to identify of age-based discrimination content. | Almost a quarter of the tweets analyzed (21.1%; n=74) addressed age-based discrimination content or was potentially offensive to older people, designated as “boomers.” The comments diminished the value of older adults’ lives or minimized COVID-19 hazards for affecting this age group. |
| PubMed | Geriatrics | Petretto et al., 2020 26 | Ageing and COVID-19: what is the role for elderly people?b | Editorial | It addresses the role of older adults in the context of COVID-19 and highlights the risks of ageism from the Italian experience. | Older adults’ greater vulnerability to coronavirus increases the risk of ageism, and actively performing roles during the pandemic reduces such risk. As a result of ageism, older adults may face major barriers in accessing healthcare and support. Protecting older adults from infection is important, but so is respecting and supporting them in this complex situation. |
| PubMed, Web of Science | Journal of Aging & Social Policy | Morrow-Howell et al., 2020 27 | Recovering from the COVID-19 Pandemic: a focus on older adults b | Article – Perspective | It discusses the challenges (including ageism) and opportunities arising from the COVID-19 pandemic based on the experience of older adults. | The COVID-19 pandemic revealed that ageism and old age-based stereotypes contributed to abandoning older adults and neglecting their needs. Memes and hashtags that disseminate the idea of eliminating or getting older adults out of the way depreciate them and validate the virus by stimulating a reduced public expenditure with this age group – deemed as unproductive, dependent, and expensive. |
| PubMed | Age and Ageing | Fraser et al., 2020 28 | Ageism and COVID-19: what does our society’s response say about us?b | Commentary | It stresses the ageism arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and discusses how older people are misrepresented and devalued in the current public discourse around the pandemic. | The current public discourse around COVID-19 misrepresents and devalues older people. At first, the pandemic was not taken seriously and was portrayed by the public discourse as only dangerous for older adults. This narrative might explain the social resistance in following public health recommendations. Ageism has reached a new level with memes and hashtags that talk about killing or eliminating older adults, represented as vulnerable and helpless beings whose death by the virus was predicted and inevitable. |
| PubMed, Scopus | Asian Journal of Psychiatry | Banerjee, 2020 29 | ‘Age and ageism in COVID-19’: elderly mental health-care vulnerabilities and needs b | Note to the Editor | It addresses ageism and age vulnerability in the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for promoting mental healthcare and the well-being of older adults. | The impact of the pandemic may be greater in older adults, given they are aware of their vulnerability and may self-neglect. Ageism may lead to elder marginalization and abuse, fostering functional dependence and decreasing well-being. |
| PubMed | Journal of Gerontological Social Work | Berg-Weger et al., 2020 30 | COVID-19 Pandemic: Workforce implications for gerontological social work b | Article | It addresses four issues that became more pronounced with the pandemics: ageism, technology, social isolation and loneliness, and interprofessional practice, considering workforce implications for gerontological social work with COVID-19. | Different ageist conducts were demonstrated throughout the pandemic, including the lack of protocols for older adults and gerontological content in the curricula of health professions providing care to older adults, inequalities in resources allocation, derogatory references to older adults, and relief for this age group presenting more risk of mortality. |
| PubMed, Web of Science | Journal of Gerontological Social Work | Swinford et al., 2020 31 | Applying gerontological social work perspectives to the coronavirus pandemic b | Commentary | It analyzes three gerontological perspectives of social assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. | The older population heterogeneity challenges ageism and the age-based stereotypes that emerged with COVID-19. Ageism notions are based on harmful stereotypes that reduce a group extremely heterogeneous into a single cohort based on their age. Rejecting ageist discourses and reinforcing arguments to support older adults and workers, volunteers and caregivers, are important measures, as well as actively promoting efforts to foster solidarity between generations. |
| PubMed | International Psychogeriatrics | Ayalon, 2020 17 | There is nothing new under the sun: ageism and intergenerational tension in the age of the COVID-19 outbreak b | Commentary | It addresses the relation between ageism and intergenerational tension in the COVID-19 pandemic. | Older adults were the main affected and less compliant with social practices implemented during the pandemic. All older adults were placed in a same homogeneous, vulnerable group, disregarding the heterogeneity of aging and reinforcing ageism, which sparks disagreements between different generations. |
| PubMed | The Journals of Gerontology | Ayalon et al., 2020 32 | Aging in times of the COVID-19 pandemic: avoiding ageism and fostering intergenerational solidarity b | Editorial | It expatiates on how ageist discourse can affect all generations. | The pandemic provoked a parallel outbreak of ageism. The media depicted older adults as a fragile group, made of powerless people, unable to contribute to society. Incorporating these stereotypes may be detrimental for both older adults and young people, during their own aging. Physical distancing must not imply social distancing, and relationships between generations must be strengthened. The concept of risk group should take into account other factors besides age, such as chronic diseases and frailty. |
| PubMed, BVS, Scopus | British Medical Journal | Archard et al., 2020 33 | Is it wrong to prioritize younger patients with covid-19?b | Note to the Editor (Opinion) | It explains the reasons why age cannot be a determining factor in deciding which life should be prioritized. | Everyone has the right to live for a certain duration, so that deciding who gets to live based only on age is not right. Moreover, old lives worth just as much as young ones. The key point is employing ethics to avoid having discriminatory and ageistic attitudes – according to which older adults worth less or are less important than young people. |
| PubMed | Journal of Aging & Social Policy | Ehni et al., 2020 34 | Six propositions against ageism in the COVID-19 pandemic. b | Article (other category) | Based on gerontological knowledge and the ethics of aging, it offers six proposals against the ageism pervading the current reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. | The pandemics evinced comments on older adults developing the most severe form of COVID-19 and having a greater risk of dying. During the pandemics, many attitudes are based on negative stereotypes of older adults’ health and functioning, devaluing their lives and exacerbating ageism. Considering that, the authors offer six proposals to change such behavior, which will be presented later. |
| PubMed, BVS | _Revista Española de Geriatria y Gerontologia_ | Tarazona-Santabalbina et al., 2020 35 | COVID-19, adult mayor y edadismo: errores que nunca han de volver a ocurrir [COVID-19, olderadults and ageism: mistakes that should never happen again]b | Editorial | It discusses ageist attitudes during the pandemic and what must be done to tackle them. | Decisions made during this health emergency do not justify the devaluation of older people. Geriatrics and gerontology professionals must join efforts to disclose more information and terminate ageism. Older adults must also have access to tests and specialized health teams to avoid such mistakes in the future. |
| PubMed | British Journal of Anaesthesia | Savulescu et al., 2020 36 | Equality or utility? Ethics and law of rationing ventilators b | Editorial | It explains the ethical terms egalitarianism and utilitarianism and how they apply to decisions regarding the allocation of intensive care and mechanical ventilation and the lives to be saved in the pandemic scenario. | Decisions regarding mechanical ventilation should be made by the health team together with the patient and grounded on aspects other than simply age or disability – as this could be jaundiced. Recognizing that people should not be arbitrarily discriminated, the authors suggest using “preventive utilitarianism” to ensure equality, so that the largest number of people would benefit from the greatest good in an equal manner. |
| PubMed | Journal of Aging & Social Policy | Previtali et al., 2020 37 | Not only virus spread: The diffusion of ageism during the outbreak of COVID-19. b | Article | It addresses ageism diffusion during the COVID-19 pandemic. | Ageism has harmful effects on society and its incidence has increased during the pandemic. Although COVID-19 affects all age groups, older populations have been highlighted by the media. Several social media comments reinforce ageism and, contrary to what has been disclosed, older adults are highly active in society and extremely affected by social isolating measures. Ageist practices during the pandemics reinforce stereotypes and violate human rights, demanding a collective effort to end this. |
| PubMed | European Cardiology Review | Martínez-Sellés et al., 2020 38 | Ethical issues in decision-making regarding the elderly affected by coronavirus disease 2019: an expert opinion b | Opinion article | It expatiates on decisions regarding the older population during the COVID-19 pandemic. | Older adults should be prioritized in preventive measures against coronavirus given they are at higher risk of contamination. Yet, decisions should not be grounded solely on age, but rather consider those more likely to survive. Social isolation incur physical and psychological risks to older adults, not only within their household, but also in hospitals, institutions, and even at wakes. |
| PubMed | Journal of Aging & Social Policy | Reynolds, 2020 39 | The COVID-19 pandemic exposes limited understanding of ageism b | Article | It addresses the lack of knowledge on ageism and its impacts on the ageing process. | With the COVID-19, the lack of knowledge regarding ageism was very evident. An important example of ageism dimensions and constructions in the context of COVID-19 was the case of the Lieutenant Governor of Texas, who said he would give up his own life to save his grandchildren’s generation. Health professionals and caregivers also state unintentional ageist comments. We must implement this biopsychosocial concept within different spheres. |
| BVS | _Cogitare Enfermagem_ | Hammerschmidt, et al., 2020 40 | _Saúde do idoso em tempos de pandemia COVID-19_ b | Free communication | It addresses, in a reflexive and critical manner, aspects related to older adults’ health in pandemic times. | The pandemic bloomed ageism. Measures aiming to protect older adults during the pandemics reinforced age-based stereotypes. This situation may have negative impacts on family relationships and promote intergenerational conflicts. Despite highlighting the importance of healthcare for older adults, the COVID-19 pandemic also reinforced ageist behaviors, mockery, and judgments. Physical distancing actions should maintain the autonomy and independence of older people. |
| Web of Science | Journal of Loss and Trauma | Rahman, et al., 2020 41 | Defining a ‘risk group’ and ageism in the era of COVID-19 b | Article | It deals with the COVID-19 cumulative incidence, addressing the classification of the group at greater risk, which is not only questionable, but also problematic. | Labeling older adults as a risk group relying entirely on age is a form of ageism that may accelerate social isolation and increase levels of psychosocial pain. Besides age, social, cultural, and contextual factors must be taken into account for formulating these groups. Social media platforms should be used positively to spread facts and avoid panic. The heterogeneity inherent to the aging process must be recognized, and positive attitudes toward older adults must start within our homes and enter digital media. |
| Web of Science | International Journal of Mental Health and Addiction | Flett, et al., 2020 42 | Aging and feeling valued versus expendable during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond: a review and commentary of why mattering is fundamental to the health and well-being of older adults a | Review and comment | It assesses the protective role of feelings considered important for older people in typical and atypical times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. | The authors present the concept of “mattering _”_ and its particularities in the older population. All people want to feel important and valued, and this fact is even more pronounced among older adults during the pandemic. Many older adults may feel more vulnerable and helpless as a result of government recommendations and the comments made. Social isolation likewise causes further hazards to the health of this population. Considering that, biased comments on aging should be avoided and measures should be developed to preserve the physical and mental health of older people. |

a Research articles.

b Opinion articles.

Opinion pieces outlined the importance of researchers to position themselves regarding a global bioethical, cultural, social, and ethical issue. By doing that, the authors take a stand not only as health professionals, but also as human beings before their equals, experiencing an issue that will scar many people’s fate. The novel coronavirus bursts a new paradigm for searching for knowledge, common good, and solidarity.

Most studies[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B18),[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B24),[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B27)indicate that ageism was more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, causing several negative impacts for older adults. Brooke e Jackson[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B18) stress that prolonged isolation may lead to loneliness, decreased mobility, increased frailty, and depression among older persons. Besides that, “ageist” discourses may increase elder abandonment[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B18). According to Banerjee[29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B29), elder neglect, loneliness, depression, anxiety, isolation, and abuse are evils associated with social distancing during the pandemic. Such scenario may be even more problematic among institutionalized adults, when distancing and hygiene measures may be inadequate. Morrow-Howell et al.[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B27) stress that older persons may have long-term emotional effects due to increased isolation and anxiety.

By analyzing a series of tweets, Jimenez-Sotomayor et al.[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B25) found 21.1% to contain age-biased comments or underestimate COVID-19 severity for believing it would only affect older groups. Other studies[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B17),[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B18),[28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B28) also verified ageism in social networks by the hashtag #boomerremover, often followed by derogatory images and jokes related to older persons. Some publications[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B24),[33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B33),[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B36),[40](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B40). critically addressed resources allocation, intensive care, mechanical ventilation, and/or decision-making based exclusively on the age criterion.

The studies also addressed the issue of ageism and intergenerational relationships[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B17),[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B32). “Ageist” discourses were increasingly present in the media during the pandemics, provoking conflicts between people of different generations. Social stratification by age makes it even more difficult for older adults to cope with a devastating natural disaster such as the pandemic[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B17). Health professionals likewise reinforced the emphasis on age as a determining factor of COVID-19 severity, highlighting the knowledge gap on ageism by them and the general population. Although rarely intentional, ageism may ensue negative consequences for older persons’ lives. Considering that, understanding ageism as a biopsychosocial concept and disseminating its definition through different spaces is crucial[41](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B41).

[](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321)DISCUSSION
------------------------------------------------------------------

Our main findings show that ageism has become present in different aspects of the lives of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although everyone is vulnerable to the novel coronavirus, older adults are at the core of the media and in most discussions about the theme.

A study[42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B42) found that ageism experiences were more common among older and young adults than in middle-aged people. While young adults reported experiencing ageism more often within their workplace, older and middle-aged individuals suffered it when looking for goods and services. For older persons, family members were not the main practitioners of ageism – although comments of this type made by a family member are interpreted as less aggressive. Regarding experiences, young people witnessed lack of respect whereas middle-aged and older adults were victims of assumptions regarding their social and physical capacity[42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B42).

Ageism may occur at the structural level, whereby social institutions reinforce systemic discrimination against older persons, or at the individual level, whereby individuals have negative opinions regarding ageing. A systematic review with 422 studies (including over 7 million participants) found ageism to lead to poorer health outcomes in older adults in 95.5% of the studies. Moreover, less developed countries presented a higher prevalence of the negative effects of ageism than more developed countries (p = < 0.001), so that it was associated with decreased health in all domains analyzed[43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B43).

Given that many older adults have to remain within their households, depending on other people’s help and service provision to obtain, for example, basic items, ageism may occur more frequently during the pandemic. In that way, studies may misfocus older adults’ physical characteristics, categorizing them as a heterogeneous group of frail and dependent people[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B36).

A study conducted with older adults from Australia[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B44)found those presenting with some type of disability to be more likely to report discrimination than those without disability or with chronic diseases. Victims of prejudice reached lower scores of self-efficacy and life satisfaction, evincing the negative effects of discrimination on older adults’ lives[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B44).

Previtali et al.[37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B37) emphasize that, despite the association between chronic diseases and age, being chronologically older does not presuppose being vulnerable or less valuable or having a precarious health. The notion that chronological age objectively defines groups, neglecting their internal differences, is an ageist assumption that supports age-based prejudices, stereotypes, and discrimination[37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B37).

Some studies report the presence of ageism in health services during the COVID-19 pandemic based mainly on resources allocation, such as prioritizing the allocation of mechanical ventilators for young people in detriment to older people. Due to the large and growing number of COVID-19 patients in Italy, the country began to implicitly adopt the age criterion for deciding the allocation of scarce resources[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B24). According to Ouchida[45](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B45), how health professionals cope with the aging process and the older adult may determine their medical assistance and treatment. Resources allocation based solely on age characterizes ageism, given that other parameters should be considered in critical situations, such as clinical conditions, frailty, functional status, and comorbidities[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B24). Everyone has the right to life, and quick decisions should be made by the health team together with the patient and family[33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B33),[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B36).

Ageism may be either implicit or explicit and might not be recognized as such. As a result of the growth in the world’s older population, an adequate communication between health professionals and individuals, a better understanding of aging heterogeneity, and the resignation of age-related stereotypes are increasingly important[46](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B46). For Cesari et al.[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B24), physicians familiarized with geriatrics and gerontology principles must help formulating more contemporary recommendations, identifying valid and efficient ways to assess morbidities and functional status in different contexts and specialties.

The publications analyzed indicate that social isolation has a negative impact on older adults’ lives. Plagg[47](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B47) evaluated the benefits and harms caused by long-term social isolation and found that, despite primarily aiming to avoid or reduce virus spread, this situation increased the risk of neurological and cardiovascular diseases, depression, cognitive decline, and mortality among older adults[45](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B45). Thus, authorities must implement measures to reduce possible harms in the case of long-term social isolation. Distancing does not implicate the termination of social relationships and support networks, and health professionals, family, and society as a whole should work together to nurture the feeling of belonging among older adults.

With physical distancing and home isolation recommendations, social media emerged as the main alternative for individuals to keep some human interaction, even if indirect. Media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic played a key role in quick disseminating scientific research and information from health authorities. Conversely, fake news, derogatory memes, and offensive opinions spread (such as the hashtag #boomerremover) evinced the ageism prevailing in society, which misconceives coronavirus as a disease “of the old” and potentiates the discriminatory content against older persons[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B25),[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B27). Creating reliable, high-quality content that confronts ageism is necessary to reduce the harmful effects of negative age-based stereotypes on older adults’ health and well-being[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B25),[48](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B48).

Intergenerational tension (the conflict between people of different generations) is manifested on social networks in the form of anger and hatred as a result of some older adults’ resistance in wearing masks or adhering to social isolation measures. Such social scenario also coined the notion that older individuals “have already lived their lives” and now it is time for them to resign, ignoring their autonomy and independence, and disregarding their social needs[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B17). By relying solely on age as a risk and lethality marker for COVID-19, these facts reveal the sharp difference and animosity between generations[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B17).

Stereotyping older adults as fragile and dependent may incur issues in all generations, as younger ones will internalize and project this image into their own aging process. Besides age, other factors make individuals more vulnerable to COVID-19, such as the presence of chronic diseases and comorbidities[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B32). Solidarity between generations is important to maximize support, interaction, and the social support network of older individuals during the pandemic[28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B28). A systematic review and meta-analysis of 63 studies (6,124 participants) found that interventions focused on education, intergenerational contact, and the combination of education and intergenerational contact were associated with ageism reduction[49](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B49).

Social behavior in old age is yet another aggravating factor, often characterized by reduced social networks and decreased participation in social activities[50](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B50). Likewise, older adults’ limited access or capacity to use digital technologies may impede or hinder them from obtaining required goods, services, and social support during the pandemic, thus leaving them more vulnerable to isolation, depression, and loneliness[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B32). For Previtali et al.[37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B37), access to technology and digital literacy were key elements for dealing with the challenges posed by quarantine.

Although protecting older adults from COVID-19 is crucial, respecting and supporting them in this complex situation is also important[26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B26). Considering the emergence of numerous ageist dilemmas and moral conflicts regarding the value of older people’s lives in the midst of the pandemic, Ehni et al.[34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B34) elaborated six aspects to combat ageism in pandemic reactions based on gerontological knowledge and the ethics of aging: 1) older adults are highly heterogeneous – their health and functioning are better than negative stereotypes suggest; 2) age limits for intensive care and other forms of medical care are inappropriate and unethical; 3) the deficient perspective regarding old age is dangerous for older adults and societies in general – intergenerational solidarity must be strengthened; 4) individuals must resist the assumption of a paternalistic attitude towards older groups; 5) the COVID-19 crisis requires older adults to use modern information and communication technologies; 6) for political orientation and for understanding the consequences of the COVID-19 crisis, not only the best of virology is necessary, but also that of gerontology.

Among the limitations of this study, we must consider that ageism in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic is still little discussed, which may explain the reduced number of publications addressing the theme and the higher prevalence of opinion pieces (editorials and comments). However, the critical-reflexive nature sustained by important theoretical assumptions enabled us to analyze several critical sociocultural aspects, comprehensive in public health.

Our results show an overview of the context and phenomenon addressed in the primary studies, bringing to light the issue of ageism, so important but little discussed in regard to the pandemic in Brazil and worldwide.

“Ageist” discourses may have negative social and psychological impacts on older adults’ lives, so that authorities should redouble efforts to reduce ageism and the dissemination of information on this harmful practice. Further public policies and scientific studies addressing the theme should be developed to promote a more just and egalitarian society, with intergenerational solidarity and respect for the rights and lives of the older people.

RESUMO
------

### OBJETIVO

Descrever os principais resultados de estudos sobre preconceito, estereotipia e discriminação relacionados à idade (ageismo) no contexto da pandemia da covid-19.

### MÉTODOS

Trata-se de uma revisão integrativa da literatura sobre o ageismo no contexto da pandemia da covid-19, realizada entre maio e junho de 2020, a partir das seguintes bases de dados: _Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online_ (_MEDLINE/PubMed_), _Web of Science_ (_Thompson Reuters_), _Scopus_ (_Elsevier Science_), Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (LILACS) e _Scientific Eletronic Library Online_ (_SciELO_).

### RESULTADOS

Foram analisadas 21 publicações que discorreram sobre o ageismo durante a pandemia, suas origens, consequências e implicações ético-políticas. As publicações identificadas são de natureza teórica com abordagem crítico-reflexiva, sendo 90,5% artigos opinativos (n = 19) e 9,5% de pesquisa (n = 2). Os principais resultados encontrados apontam críticas em relação à destinação de recursos e cuidados intensivos baseados exclusivamente no critério etário. São também apontados os impactos do isolamento social, o uso das tecnologias e mídias sociais e as relações intergeracionais no cenário da covid-19.

### CONCLUSÃO

A maioria das publicações indicam que o ageismo sempre esteve presente, mas tornou-se mais evidente durante a pandemia da covid-19 como forma de discriminação contra idosos. Ressalta-se que discursos “ageistas” podem influenciar negativamente na vida dos idosos e causar impactos sociais e psicológicos prejudiciais.

INTRODUÇÃO
----------

Em dezembro de 2019, uma doença respiratória grave, de etiologia desconhecida, foi identificada na cidade de Wuhan, China. Posteriormente foi reconhecida como uma doença infecciosa causada pelo novo coronavírus (_Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2_ ou Sars-Cov-2) e denominada _Coronavirus disease 2019_ (covid-19)[1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B1). Devido à rápida disseminação do vírus e ao aumento do número de casos da doença em diferentes partes do mundo, no dia 11 de março de 2020, a Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS) declarou a vigência da pandemia da covid-19[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B2).

A pandemia causada pelo novo coronavírus constitui um dos maiores problemas de saúde pública dos últimos 100 anos. Os desafios impostos aos países incluem a definição de medidas que garantam a proteção da saúde e minimizem os danos econômicos e sociais, respeitando os direitos humanos[3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B3). Toda população mundial é susceptível à doença, mas países com populações mais idosas têm sofrido mais os impactos da pandemia, especialmente em relação à morbimortalidade. Estudos demostram que idosos possuem maior risco de desenvolver formas graves da covid-19, podendo levá-los ao óbito[4](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B4). Tal fato relaciona-se, entre outros fatores, à imunossenescência, processo caracterizado pelo declínio progressivo da função imunológica e consequente aumento da suscetibilidade às infecções[6](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B6). Além da idade, outros fatores como a alta prevalência de multimorbidade, fragilidade e alterações inflamatórias tornam esse grupo etário mais vulnerável e podem complicar o curso da doença[7](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B7).

Dentre as medidas para conter a expansão da pandemia, a OMS sugeriu que todos os países adotassem o distanciamento social a fim de conter a propagação do vírus, evitar o colapso dos sistemas de saúde e reduzir o número de vítimas da covid-19[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B8). Contudo, essa estratégia pode gerar impactos negativos em diversos segmentos da sociedade. Bezerra et al.[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B9) realizaram uma pesquisa de opinião no Brasil sobre a percepção do isolamento social durante a pandemia de covid-19 (n = 16.440), identificando o convívio social como aspecto mais afetado entre as pessoas, seguido pelo financeiro.

As autoridades sanitárias nos diferentes países passaram, então, a recomendar a adoção de outras estratégias para conter a transmissão do vírus, tais como: a proibição de aglomerações, restrição à circulação e limitação do contato com populações especiais (por exemplo, em instituições de longa permanência, como é o caso de prisões). Tais medidas geraram impactos negativos sociais, econômicos e relacionados à saúde[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B10).

Vários grupos etários podem ser vulneráveis aos efeitos das medidas de controle e prevenção da covid-19, incluindo o distanciamento e o isolamento social dele resultante. Na atualidade, os idosos estão cada vez mais expostos à possibilidade de viver sozinhos e ter menos oportunidades de interação social[11](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B11), além disso, saem menos de casa para atividades sociais, recreativas, religiosas e utilitaristas, em função de dificuldades de mobilidade e por condições ambientais inadequadas. Outro fator relevante é que essa população recorre menos do que os não idosos aos sistemas de comunicações _on-line_ para se informar, fazer compras, contatos e se divertir. Com isso, tornam-se particularmente expostos aos riscos decorrentes do isolamento social e da solidão durante o período de distanciamento imposto pela pandemia[12](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B12),[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B13).

O isolamento social é definido como a falta generalizada de contato ou comunicação social, de participação em atividades sociais ou de contato com um confidente, estando associado ao aumento de quase um terço na chance de mortalidade (OR = 1,29)[14](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B14). Comumente associada ao isolamento social[13](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B13),[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B15), a solidão emocional é uma experiência pessoal de falta de contatos sociais significativos, que dá origem a sentimentos negativos como o desinteresse, tédio, fadiga e apatia, além de provocar a potencialização de dores, problemas de sono, perda de apetite e inatividade física. Em conjunto, as consequências do isolamento social e da solidão emocional aumentam a vulnerabilidade dos idosos à depressão e os expõem a um maior risco de morte[15](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B15),[16](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B16).

Com a pandemia da covid-19 e o risco de sobrecarga dos sistemas de saúde em alguns países e regiões, surgiram discussões acerca da destinação de recursos de saúde prioritariamente para pacientes jovens e adultos. Tal possibilidade suscitou e alimentou a polêmica em torno de questões éticas fundamentais, entre elas o direito à vida e o direito do profissional de decidir quem deve viver e quem deve morrer[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B17). Paralelamente, _memes_ depreciativos, estereótipos negativos e discursos preconceituosos contra os idosos emergiram na internet, nas mídias e nas redes sociais, evidenciando a discriminação por idade na sociedade[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B18).

A pandemia evidenciou a questão dos preconceitos com relação aos idosos, que não é recente na história. O termo “ageismo” é um neologismo originário da língua inglesa (_ageism_), criado e usado pela primeira vez em 1969 pelo psiquiatra e gerontólogo norte-americano Robert Butler, para designar o preconceito de um grupo de idade contra outros grupos de idade, ou como toda forma de estereotipia e de discriminação contra pessoas com base na idade cronológica[19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B19). No mesmo texto, Robert Butler enfatiza as vocações essenciais do ageismo, de ser orientado a idosos e de incluir processos sistemáticos de estereotipia e discriminação contra pessoas em razão de sua idade. O autor classificou o ageismo como uma forma de intolerância comparável ao sexismo e ao racismo e, seis anos mais tarde, refinou o conceito, dizendo que o ageismo inclui atitudes preconceituosas em relação às pessoas idosas, à velhice e ao processo do envelhecimento; práticas sociais discriminativas contra os idosos e práticas/políticas institucionais que perpetuam os estereótipos contra os mais velhos[20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B20).

Embora se admita que o ageismo possa ser dirigido a jovens e adultos[21](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B21),[22](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B22), a grande maioria dos estudos teóricos e das pesquisas sobre ageismo é centrada nos idosos. Essa ocorrência é particularmente verdadeira com relação ao tratamento dispensado aos idosos durante a pandemia da covid-19, o que ocorre em função da combinação entre maior vulnerabilidade biológica e menor poder político desse grupo quando comparado os mais jovens. O termo _ageism_ foi traduzido como discriminação por idade, etarismo ou ageismo e registrado na lista de Descritores das Ciências da Saúde (DeCS) da Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde (Lilacs) e da Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde (BVS).

Diante do contexto da pandemia da covid-19 e considerando o envelhecimento um processo complexo, dinâmico e heterogêneo, a discriminação contra idosos e a estigmatização com base na idade têm sido mais evidentes, o que demanda discussões éticas e políticas importantes. O objetivo desta revisão foi descrever os principais resultados de estudos sobre preconceitos, estereotipia e discriminação com relação à idade (ageismo) no contexto da pandemia da covid-19.

MÉTODOS
-------

A revisão integrativa de literatura consiste na abordagem metodológica empregada para fornecer conhecimentos produzidos sobre uma determinada temática, de maneira sistemática, ordenada e abrangente. Organiza-se em seis fases: identificação do tema, hipótese ou questão de pesquisa; identificação de critérios pré-estabelecidos de busca na literatura; definição das informações a serem extraídas dos estudos selecionados/categorização dos estudos; avaliação crítica dos estudos incluídos; interpretação dos resultados; e apresentação da revisão/síntese do conhecimento[23](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B23).

Neste estudo, realizou-se uma busca na literatura sobre a discriminação etária (ageismo ou etarismo) contra idosos no contexto da pandemia da covid-19, considerando periódicos nacionais e internacionais. As estratégias de busca eletrônica foram conduzidas por dois pesquisadores independentes, entre o período de 01 de maio a 15 de junho de 2020, nas seguintes bases de dados: _Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online_ (MEDLINE/PubMed), _Web of Science_ (Thompson Reuters), _Scopus_ (Elsevier Science), Lilacs e da _Scientific Eletronic Library Online_ (SciELO). Um terceiro pesquisador foi consultado para opinar sobre a inclusão ou não das publicações selecionadas, visando solucionar divergências entre os dois pesquisadores.

Os descritores foram utilizados de acordo com o _Medical Subject Heading_ (MeSH) e seus equivalentes na língua portuguesa, estabelecidos pelos Descritores em Ciências da Saúde (DeCS). Os termos foram combinados utilizando os operadores booleanos “_AND_” e “_OR_” para compor as estratégias de busca, elaboradas para cada base de dados. Os seguintes termos foram utilizados como descritores durante as buscas nas bases de dados: covid-19 _OR_ 2019 _novel coronavirus disease OR_ covid19 _OR_ covid-19 _pandemic OR_ SARS-CoV-2 _infection OR_ covid-19 _virus disease OR_ 2019 _novel coronavirus infection OR_ 2019-nCoV _infection OR coronavirus disease_ 2019 _OR coronavirus disease_-19 _OR_ 2019-nCoV _disease OR_ covid-19 _virus infection AND Ageism OR Age Discrimination OR Age Discriminations OR Discrimination, Age OR Discriminations, Age_.

Os critérios de inclusão foram as publicações cujo objeto de estudo era o ageismo na população idosa (pessoas com idade ≥ 60 anos) e os reflexos na pandemia da covid-19. No presente estudo não houve restrição de ano, desenho metodológico ou idioma das publicações sobre o tema. Foram excluídas publicações que tratavam do ageismo em grupos etários inferiores a 60 anos de idade ou não se relacionavam à pandemia da covid-19. As publicações que se apresentaram em mais de uma base de dados foram consideradas apenas uma vez.

RESULTADOS
----------

A busca inicial nas plataformas de pesquisa identificou 43 publicações com base no título. Desses, 21 manuscritos foram eliminados (com base no título e no resumo) por serem estudos duplicados ou não relacionados ao tema de interesse. Assim, foram selecionados 22 estudos para a leitura na íntegra e, dentre esses, um artigo foi excluído depois da consulta do terceiro pesquisador por não abordar a temática ageismo na pandemia como foco principal. Deste modo, 21 artigos foram utilizados nesta revisão integrativa. Dezoito artigos foram encontrados na MEDLINE/Pubmed, sete na Web of Science, quatro na BVS/Lilacs e três na Scopus. Alguns artigos estavam publicados em duas ou mais bases de dados. A [Figura](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#f01002) 1 exibe o fluxograma relativo às ações do processo de seleção das publicações.

A síntese das publicações contempladas nesta revisão, de acordo com a base de dados em que estava disponível, o periódico, o(s) autor(es), ano de publicação, título, tipo de estudo, considerações/objetivos e os resultados de interesse, é mostrada no [Quadro](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#t1002) 1. A maioria dos artigos (90,4%; n=19) foi publicada em inglês, os demais em espanhol (n = 1) e em português (n=1). De modo geral, as publicações identificadas eram de natureza teórica com abordagem crítico-reflexiva, sendo 90,5% artigos opinativos (n = 19) e 9,5% de pesquisa (n = 2).

A pandemia inicialmente não foi levada a sério e o discurso público a apresentou como perigosa apenas para os idosos. Possivelmente essa narrativa explica resistência em seguir as diretrizes de saúde pública. O ageismo atingiu um novo nível com as memes e hashtags que falam em matar ou eliminar os idosos, que são representados como seres vulneráveis e desamparados, cuja morte pelo vírus já era prevista e considerada inevitável. |

A mídia destacou os idosos como um grupo de pessoas frágeis, impotentes e incapazes de contribuir para a sociedade. A incorporação desses estereótipos pode ser prejudicial aos idosos e aos jovens durante seu próprio envelhecimento. É importante que o distanciamento físico não seja também social e que sejam fortalecidas as relações entre as gerações. Não se deve pensar em grupo de risco apenas pela idade, sem levar em consideração outros fatores, como doenças crônicas e fragilidade. |

b Artigos opinativos.

Os artigos de opinião destacaram a importância dos pesquisadores da área se posicionarem acerca de uma questão bioética, cultural, social e ética envolvendo o mundo todo. Os autores se posicionam não só como profissionais de saúde, mas também como seres humanos diante de seus iguais em um problema que marcará o destino de muitas pessoas. O novo coronavírus nos traz um novo paradigma para a busca de conhecimento, bem comum e solidariedade.

Observou-se que a maioria das publicações[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B18),[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B24),[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B27)destacam que o ageismo ficou mais evidente durante a pandemia da covid-19, gerando diversos impactos negativos para os idosos. Brooke e Jackson[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B18) enfatizam que o isolamento prolongado pode contribuir para a solidão, diminuição da mobilidade, aumento da fragilidade e depressão em idosos, além disso, os discursos “ageistas” podem aumentar o abandono dos mais longevos[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B18). Banerjee[29](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B29) sugere que, em idosos, a negligência, a solidão, a depressão, a ansiedade, o isolamento e os abusos são males associados ao distanciamento social durante a pandemia, podendo ser mais problemáticos naqueles institucionalizados, em que as medidas de distanciamento e higiene podem não ser adequadas. Morrow-Howell et al.[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B27) ressaltam que os idosos podem ter efeitos emocionais duradouros devido ao aumento do isolamento e da ansiedade.

Jimenez-Sotomayor et al.[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B25) analisaram _tweets_ e identificaram que 21,1% deles continham comentários com algum preconceito etário ou menosprezavam a gravidade da covid-19 por considerarem que atingia apenas os idosos. Outros estudos[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B17),[18](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B18),[28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B28) também identificaram o ageismo presente nas redes sociais com o uso da _hashtag #boomerremover_, normalmente acompanhada de imagens depreciativas e piadas relacionadas aos idosos. Algumas publicações[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B24),[33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B33),[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B36),[40](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B40) abordaram de forma crítica a destinação de recursos, de cuidados intensivos, de ventilação mecânica e/ou tomada de decisões baseadas exclusivamente no critério etário.

O ageismo e as relações intergeracionais também foram abordadas[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B17),[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B32). Com os discursos “ageistas” cada vez mais presentes na mídia durante a pandemia, houve a acentuação do conflito entre pessoas de gerações diferentes. Dividir a sociedade por faixas etárias torna ainda mais difícil o enfrentamento dos idosos diante de um fenômeno natural devastador como a pandemia[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B17). A ênfase na idade como fator determinante da gravidade da covid-19 foi propagada também por profissionais da saúde, evidenciado a falta de conhecimento dos mesmos e da população geral sobre o ageismo. Nesse caso o ageismo raramente é feito de forma intencional, porém, pode afetar negativamente a vida dos idosos. Dessa forma, é importante que se entenda o ageismo como um conceito biopsicossocial e sua definição seja disseminada em diferentes espaços[41](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B41)

DISCUSSÃO
---------

Os principais achados desta revisão mostram que o ageismo se tornou presente em vários aspectos na vida dos idosos durante a pandemia. Embora todas as pessoas possam ser afetadas pela doença (covid-19), os idosos estão no centro da mídia e na maioria das discussões acerca da temática.

Um estudo[42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B42) identificou que as experiências de ageismo foram mais comuns em idosos e adultos jovens, comparativamente às pessoas de meia-idade. Enquanto os adultos jovens referiram sofrer ageismo mais frequentemente no ambiente de trabalho, em idosos e indivíduos de meia-idade foi mais comum quando procuravam mercadorias e serviços. Curiosamente, os idosos não citaram familiares como principais praticantes de ageismo, valendo ressaltar que, geralmente, quando há algum comentário desse tipo por um familiar, ele é interpretado como menos agressivo. Considerando-se o tipo de experiência, os jovens relataram a falta de respeito, já os adultos de meia-idade e os idosos citaram suposições sobre capacidade social e física[42](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B42).

O ageismo pode ocorrer em nível estrutural, em que as instituições sociais reforçam o preconceito sistemático contra os idosos e em nível individual, no qual os indivíduos têm opiniões negativas sobre o processo de envelhecimento. Revisão sistemática, que incluiu 422 estudos (mais de 7 milhões de participantes), identificou que em 95,5% dos estudos analisados o ageismo levou a piores resultados na saúde de idosos. Observou-se ainda uma prevalência maior do efeito negativo do ageismo na saúde em países menos desenvolvidos quando comparados aos mais desenvolvidos (p = < 0,001). O ageismo foi associado com piora na saúde em todos os domínios analisados[43](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B43).

Ressalta-se que, durante a pandemia, o ageismo pode ser mais frequente, tendo em vista que muitos idosos permanecem dentro de suas casas dependendo da ajuda e prestação de serviços de outras pessoas para, por exemplo, obter itens básicos. Dessa forma, pode ser dado um foco errôneo nas características físicas dos idosos como um grupo heterogêneo de pessoas frágeis e dependentes[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B36).

Estudo realizado com idosos na Austrália[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B44), identificou que aqueles com algum tipo de incapacidade eram mais propensos a relatar discriminação do que idosos sem incapacidade ou com condições crônicas de saúde. Os indivíduos que sofreram preconceito apresentaram menores escores de autoeficácia e satisfação com a vida, denotando efeitos negativos da discriminação na vida das pessoas idosas[44](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B44).

Previtali et al.[37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B37) enfatizam que, embora seja observada relação entre a presença de doenças crônicas e a idade, ser cronologicamente idoso não significa ser vulnerável, em estado precário de saúde ou menos valioso. Além disso, a ideia de que a idade cronológica define objetivamente os grupos, negligenciando suas diferenças internas, é uma suposição que configura ageismo, pois apoia preconceitos, estereótipos e discriminação com base na idade[37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B37).

Alguns estudos indicam o ageismo nos serviços de saúde durante a pandemia da covid-19, principalmente na distribuição de recursos, como a destinação de ventiladores mecânicos prioritária para jovens, em relação aos idosos. Na Itália, devido ao elevado e crescente número de pacientes com covid-19, o critério de idade começou a ser implicitamente adotado no algoritmo decisório para a alocação dos recursos escassos[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B24). Segundo Ouchida[45](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B45), a forma como os profissionais de saúde consideram o envelhecimento e o idoso pode determinar o atendimento e tratamento do mesmo. Ademais, a destinação de recursos baseada apenas na idade caracteriza-se como ageismo, pois, em situações críticas, devem ser considerados outros parâmetros, como condições clínicas, fragilidade, estado funcional e comorbidades[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B24). Todos têm direito à vida e as decisões rápidas deveriam ser tomadas pela equipe em conjunto com o paciente e família[33](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B33),[36](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B36).

O ageismo pode ser implícito ou explícito e muitas vezes pode não ser reconhecido. Considerando-se o aumento da população idosa, torna-se cada vez mais importante a comunicação adequada entre profissionais de saúde e indivíduos, a melhor compreensão da heterogeneidade do envelhecimento e a renúncia de estereótipos relacionados à velhice[46](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B46). Cesari et al.[24](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B24) sugerem que médicos familiarizados com os princípios de geriatria e gerontologia apoiem o desenvolvimento de recomendações mais contemporâneas, identificando maneiras válidas e eficientes de avaliar morbidades e status funcional nos diferentes contextos e especialidades.

As publicações apontam que o isolamento social impactou negativamente na vida dos idosos. Plagg[47](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B47) avaliou os benefícios e danos decorrentes do isolamento social prolongado para os idosos e destacam que, apesar do objetivo principal ser evitar ou diminuir a propagação do vírus, a situação eleva o risco de doenças neurológicas, cardiovasculares, depressão, declínio cognitivo e mortalidade[45](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B45). Portanto, caso prolongado o isolamento social, medidas para reduzir os possíveis danos devem ser tomadas. Além disso, o distanciamento não deve ser entendido como o fim das relações sociais e das redes de apoio, e os profissionais de saúde, a sociedade e a família devem trabalhar juntos para que o idoso continue com a sensação de pertencimento.

Com as recomendações do distanciamento físico e isolamento domiciliar, as mídias sociais surgiram como principal alternativa para que o indivíduo possa manter algum contato humano, ainda que indireto. Além disso, a cobertura da mídia sobre a pandemia da covid-19 desempenhou papel fundamental na disseminação rápida de pesquisas científicas e informações por autoridades sanitárias. Em contrapartida, a propagação de _fake news, memes_ depreciativos, opiniões ofensivas (como o uso da hashtag _#boomerremover_) evidenciaram o ageismo vigente na sociedade, que erroneamente prega o coronavírus como uma doença “de velho” e potencializa o teor discriminatório contra aqueles de mais idade[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B25),[27](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B27). A criação de conteúdo confiável, de alta qualidade e que enfrente o ageismo faz-se necessária a fim de reduzir os efeitos maléficos dos estereótipos negativos do envelhecimento na saúde e no bem-estar da população idosa[25](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B25),[48](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B48).

A tensão intergeracional – caracterizada como o conflito entre pessoas de diferentes gerações – manifestou-se em forma de raiva e ódio nas redes sociais por causa da resistência de alguns idosos para usar máscaras ou aderir às medidas de isolamento social. Além disso, foi estabelecida a ideia de que idosos “já viveram suas vidas” e agora é hora de renunciarem, ignorando sua autonomia, independência e desconsiderando suas necessidades sociais[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B17). Tais fatos indicam a acentuada diferença e animosidade entre gerações, baseando-se apenas na idade como um marcador de risco e de letalidade da covid-19[17](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B17).

Estereotipar o idoso como indivíduo frágil e dependente pode causar problemas em todas as gerações, pois os mais jovens interiorizam essa imagem e a projetarão para si em seu envelhecimento. Não é apenas a idade que tornam os indivíduos mais vulneráveis ao covid-19, existem outros fatores como a presença de doenças crônicas e comorbidades[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B32). A solidariedade entre gerações é importante para maximizar o apoio, a conexão e a rede de suporte social dos idosos durante a pandemia[28](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B28). Revisão sistemática e metanálise, que incluiu 63 estudos (6.124 participantes), identificou que as intervenções focadas em educação, contato intergeracional e educação, combinada ao contato intergeracional, associaram-se à redução do ageismo[49](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B49).

Outro agravante é o comportamento social na velhice, muitas vezes, caracterizado pela redução das redes sociais e diminuição da participação em atividades sociais[50](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B50). Ainda, o acesso ou a capacidade limitada de uso das tecnologias digitais pelos idosos pode impedi-los ou dificultar a obtenção de bens, serviços e apoio social necessários durante a pandemia, deixando-os mais vulneráveis ao isolamento, à depressão e à solidão[32](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B32). Previtali et al.[37](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B37) apontam que o acesso à tecnologia, bem como à alfabetização digital, demonstrou ser um elemento-chave na capacidade de lidar com os desafios impostos pela quarentena.

É muito importante proteger os idosos da covid-19, mas também é importante respeitá-los e apoiá-los nessa situação complexa[26](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B26). Com o surgimento de numerosos dilemas ageistas e conflitos morais referentes ao valor da vida das pessoas idosas em meio a pandemia, destacam-se os seis pontos elaborados por Ehni et al.[34](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8023321#B34), baseados em conhecimentos gerontológicos e na ética do envelhecimento para o combate do ageismo presente nas reações à pandemia: 1) os idosos são altamente heterogêneos - sua saúde e funcionamento são melhores do que os estereótipos negativos sugerem; 2) limites de idade para terapia intensiva e outras formas de assistência médica são inapropriados e antiéticos; 3) a visão deficitária da velhice é perigosa para os idosos e sociedades em geral - a solidariedade entre gerações deve ser fortalecida; 4) resistir à suposição de uma atitude paternalista em relação aos idosos; 5) a crise da covid-19 exige o uso de modernas tecnologias da informação e comunicação entre os idosos e; 6) a crise do covid-19 não apenas exige o melhor da virologia, mas também o melhor da gerontologia para orientação política e a compreensão das consequências em geral.

Dentre as limitações deste estudo, deve-se considerar que, globalmente, o ageismo é uma temática ainda pouco discutida no contexto da pandemia da covid-19, o que pode explicar, mesmo que parcialmente, o número reduzido de publicações encontradas sobre o tema e a predominância de artigos opinativos (editoriais e comentários). Contudo, ressalta-se a natureza critico-reflexiva sustentada em importantes pressupostos teóricos que permitem analisar diversos pontos críticos socioculturais e de abrangência em saúde pública.

De modo geral, os resultados desta revisão integrativa demonstram um retrato do contexto e fenômeno de interesse dos estudos primários, trazendo à tona esse tema tão importante e ainda pouco discutido em relação à pandemia no Brasil e no mundo.

Os discursos “ageistas” podem causar impactos sociais e psicológicos negativos na vida dos idosos. Faz-se necessário aumentar os esforços para a redução do ageismo, bem como a difusão de informações sobre essa prática tão prejudicial. Observa-se a importância do desenvolvimento de políticas públicas e estudos científicos envolvendo o tema a fim de promover a construção de uma sociedade mais justa e igualitária, com solidariedade intergeracional e respeito aos direitos e a vida das pessoas idosas.
