 We owe you an explanation. 

December 5: An important update for readers in the United States. 

Please don't skip this 1-minute read. It's Friday, December 5, and this moment matters for Wikipedia because we haven't hit our goal yet. If you're like us, you've used Wikipedia countless times. To settle an argument with a friend. To satisfy a curiosity. Whether it's 3 in the morning or afternoon, Wikipedia is useful in your life. Please give $2.75.

After nearly 25 years, Wikipedia is still the internet we were promised—created by people, not by machines. It's not perfect, but it's not here to push a point of view. It's owned by a nonprofit, not a giant technology company or a billionaire.

Just 2% of our readers donate, so if you have given in the past and Wikipedia still provides you with $2.75 worth of knowledge, donate today. If you are undecided, remember any contribution helps.

25 years of the internet at its **best**

Where your donation goes

 Accountability and transparency are core values at the Wikimedia Foundation. We manage funds and resources to ensure that every contribution supports our mission. We have earned the Platinum Seal of Transparency from Candid (formerly GuideStar), and Charity Navigator awarded us its highest rating. You can [read our most recent annual report](https://annual.wikimedia.org/) for more information about our financial health. 

 Investment in Technology 45%
Nearly half of our budget goes toward supporting the technology that powers Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects. We are constantly working to enhance the user experience for both contributors and readers, improve site security, and ensure reliable access to our websites globally. This infrastructure and product support sustain one of the top ten most visited websites in the world, all at a fraction of the cost of popular for-profit websites.

 Support for Volunteers 34%
The global reach of Wikimedia projects is made possible by the hard work of volunteers from across the globe. We provide grants, legal support, and other resources to help build vibrant volunteer communities. Additionally, we promote community engagement through outreach initiatives and advocate for the growth and protection of free knowledge.

 General and Administrative Expenses 12%
Operational costs are essential for the smooth management and governance of the Wikimedia Foundation. These expenses help us recruit top talent and support staff around the world, empowering them to carry out the mission of the Wikimedia Foundation.

 Allocation to Fundraising Efforts 11%
Donor support is crucial to sustaining Wikipedia and our other free knowledge endeavors. Our team is committed to efficient and effective fundraising throughout the year, ensuring that every contribution helps advance our mission.

The global **COVID-19 pandemic** (also known as the **coronavirus pandemic**), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 ([SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2 "SARS-CoV-2")), began with an outbreak in [Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan "Wuhan"), China, in December 2019. Soon afterward, it spread to other parts of Asia and [then worldwide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_by_country_and_territory "COVID-19 pandemic by country and territory") in early 2020. The [World Health Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization "World Health Organization") (WHO) declared the outbreak a [public health emergency of international concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health_emergency_of_international_concern "Public health emergency of international concern") (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020, and assessed it as having become a [pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic "Pandemic") on 11 March.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-start-3) The WHO declared the public health emergency caused by COVID-19 had ended in May 2023.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-reuters-4)

[COVID-19 symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_symptoms "COVID-19 symptoms") range from [asymptomatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic "Asymptomatic") to deadly, but most commonly include fever, [sore throat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat "Sore throat"), [nocturnal cough](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturnal_cough "Nocturnal cough"), and fatigue. [Transmission of the virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_of_COVID-19 "Transmission of COVID-19") is often [through airborne particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airborne_transmission "Airborne transmission"). Mutations have [produced many strains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variants_of_SARS-CoV-2 "Variants of SARS-CoV-2") (variants) with varying degrees of infectivity and [virulence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virulence "Virulence").[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-11)[COVID-19 vaccines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine "COVID-19 vaccine") were developed rapidly and [deployed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_of_COVID-19_vaccines "Deployment of COVID-19 vaccines") to the general public beginning in December 2020, made available through government and [international](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_organization "International organization") programmes such as [COVAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVAX "COVAX"), aiming to provide [vaccine equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_equity "Vaccine equity"). [Treatments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treatment_and_management_of_COVID-19 "Treatment and management of COVID-19") include [novel antiviral drugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_drug_development "COVID-19 drug development") and symptom control. Common mitigation measures during the public health emergency included [travel restrictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_restrictions_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic"), [lockdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns "COVID-19 lockdowns"), business restrictions and closures, [workplace hazard controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workplace_hazard_controls_for_COVID-19 "Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19"), [mask mandates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"), quarantines, [testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing "COVID-19 testing") systems, and [contact tracing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing "Contact tracing") of the infected.

The pandemic caused severe [social](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Social impact of the COVID-19 pandemic") and [economic disruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic") around the world, including [the largest global recession](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_recession "COVID-19 recession") since the [Great Depression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression "Great Depression").[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-RFXoH-12)[Widespread supply shortages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortages_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic"), including [food shortages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_security_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Food security during the COVID-19 pandemic"), were caused by [supply chain disruptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021%E2%80%932022_global_supply_chain_crisis "2021–2022 global supply chain crisis") and [panic buying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_buying "Panic buying"). Reduced human activity led to an [unprecedented temporary decrease in pollution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_the_environment "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment"). Educational institutions and public areas were partially or fully [closed in many jurisdictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_education "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on education"), and many events were cancelled or postponed during 2020 and 2021. [Telework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work "Remote work") became much more common for [white-collar workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White-collar_worker "White-collar worker") as the pandemic evolved. [Misinformation circulated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_misinformation "COVID-19 misinformation") through social media and occasionally through mass media, and [political tensions intensified](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Political impact of the COVID-19 pandemic"). The pandemic raised issues of [racial and geographic discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia_and_racism_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Xenophobia and racism related to the COVID-19 pandemic"), [health equity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_equity "Health equity"), and the balance between [public health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health "Public health") imperatives and [individual rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_and_group_rights "Individual and group rights").

The disease has continued to circulate since 2023. As of 2024, experts were uncertain as to whether it still qualified as a pandemic.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-timemarch2024-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-14) Different definitions of pandemics lead to different determinations of when they end.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-timemarch2024-13)[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-charters2021-15) As of 5 December 2025, COVID-19 has caused 7,102,566[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Template:COVID-19_data-5) confirmed deaths, and 18.2 to 33.5 million estimated deaths.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Economist2023-9) The pandemic ranks as the fifth-[deadliest pandemic or epidemic in history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadliest_pandemics_in_history "Deadliest pandemics in history").

### Pandemic

In [epidemiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemiology "Epidemiology"), a [pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic "Pandemic") is defined as "an epidemic occurring over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries, and usually affecting a large number of people". During the COVID-19 pandemic, as with other pandemics, the meaning of this term has been challenged.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-16)

The end of a pandemic or other epidemic only rarely involves the total disappearance of a disease, and historically, much less attention has been given to defining the ends of epidemics than their beginnings. The ends of particular epidemics have been defined in a variety of ways, differing according to academic field, and differently based on location and social group. An epidemic's end can be considered a social phenomenon, not just a biological one.[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-charters2021-15)

[_Time_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_(magazine) "Time (magazine)") reported in March 2024 that expert opinions differ on whether or not COVID-19 is currently considered endemic or pandemic, and that the WHO continued to call the disease a pandemic on its website.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-timemarch2024-13)

### Virus names

During [the initial outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Hubei "COVID-19 pandemic in Hubei") in [Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan "Wuhan"), the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus", "Wuhan coronavirus",[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-17) "the coronavirus outbreak" and the "Wuhan coronavirus outbreak",[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-18) with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan [pneumonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia "Pneumonia")".[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-19)[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20) In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCoV[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-WHO_report-21) and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-22) as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 international guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus names in part to prevent [social stigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stigma "Social stigma").[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-23) WHO finalised the official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-WHO-naming-24) WHO Director-General [Tedros Ghebreyesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tedros_Ghebreyesus "Tedros Ghebreyesus") explained: CO for _corona_, VI for _virus_, D for _disease_ and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-25) WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-WHO-naming-24)

WHO named [variants of concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_of_concern "Variant of concern") and [variants of interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_of_concern "Variant of concern") using [Greek letters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_alphabet "Greek alphabet"). The initial practice of naming them according to where the variants were identified (e.g. [Delta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Delta_variant "SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant") began as the "[Indian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India") variant") is no longer common.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-26) A more systematic naming scheme reflects the variant's [PANGO lineage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_Assignment_of_Named_Global_Outbreak_Lineages "Phylogenetic Assignment of Named Global Outbreak Lineages") (e.g., [Omicron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant")'s lineage is B.1.1.529) and is used for other variants.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-BBC.May.31.2021-27)[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-28)[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-29)

### Background

Main articles: [Origin of SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_of_SARS-CoV-2 "Origin of SARS-CoV-2") and [COVID-19 pandemic in Hubei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Hubei "COVID-19 pandemic in Hubei")

SARS-CoV-2 is a virus closely related to [bat coronaviruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_virome#Coronaviruses "Bat virome"),[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-LancetNowcasting-30)[pangolin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangolin "Pangolin") coronaviruses,[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-ia56U-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Zhang6April2020-32) and [SARS-CoV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-1 "SARS-CoV-1").[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-ECDC_risk_assessment-33) The first known [outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak "Outbreak") (the [2019–2020 COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_COVID-19_outbreak_in_mainland_China "2019–2020 COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China")) started in [Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan "Wuhan"), Hubei, China, in December 2019.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-34) Many early cases were linked to people who had visited the [Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huanan_Seafood_Wholesale_Market "Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market") there,[[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Sun2020epidemiology-35)[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-36)[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Maxmen2021whoReport-37) but it is possible that human-to-human transmission began earlier.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Hu2020natureReviews-38)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Graham2020immunity-39)[Molecular clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_clock "Molecular clock") analysis suggests that the first cases were likely to have been between October and November 2019.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-40)

The scientific consensus is that the virus is most likely of a [zoonotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonotic "Zoonotic") origin, from bats or another closely related mammal.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Hu2020natureReviews-38)[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-41)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-To2021lessons-42) While other explanations such as speculations that SARS-CoV-2 was accidentally [released from a laboratory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lab_leak_theory "COVID-19 lab leak theory") have been proposed,[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-CovidMayHave-43)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-nofact-44)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200208economist-45) as of 2021 these were not sufficiently supported by evidence.[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Holmes2021-46)

### Cases

Main articles: [COVID-19 pandemic by country and territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_by_country_and_territory "COVID-19 pandemic by country and territory") and [COVID-19 pandemic cases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_cases "COVID-19 pandemic cases")

Official "case" counts refer to the number of people who have been [tested for COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing "COVID-19 testing") and whose test has been confirmed positive according to official protocols whether or not they experienced symptomatic disease.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-1ceLG-47)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-J0rix-48) Due to the effect of [sampling bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias "Sampling bias"), studies which obtain a more accurate number by extrapolating from a random sample have consistently found that total infections considerably exceed the reported case counts.[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-WqXOo-49)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-BtFLV-50) Many countries, early on, had official policies to not test those with only mild symptoms.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-elpais640000-51)[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200313reuters-52) The strongest risk factors for severe illness are obesity, [complications of diabetes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complications_of_diabetes "Complications of diabetes"), anxiety disorders, and the total number of conditions.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-53)

During the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not clear whether young people were less likely to be infected, or less likely to develop symptoms and be tested.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-vox21190033-54) A retrospective [cohort study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohort_study "Cohort study") in China found that [children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_children "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children") and adults were just as likely to be infected.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-489Q3-55)

Among more thorough studies, [preliminary results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_Case-Cluster-Study "COVID-19 Case-Cluster-Study") from 9 April 2020 found that in [Gangelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gangelt "Gangelt"), the centre of a major infection cluster in Germany, 15 per cent of a population sample tested positive for [antibodies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody "Antibody").[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-otW1O-56) Screening for COVID-19 in pregnant women [in New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_New_York_City "COVID-19 pandemic in New York City"), and [blood donors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_donor "Blood donor") in the Netherlands, found rates of positive antibody tests that indicated more infections than reported.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-rCdvL-57)[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200416reuters-58)[Seroprevalence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seroprevalence "Seroprevalence")-based estimates are conservative as some studies show that persons with mild symptoms do not have detectable antibodies.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-0LgFK-59)

Initial estimates of the [basic reproduction number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number "Basic reproduction number") (R 0) for COVID-19 in January 2020 were between 1.4 and 2.5,[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-WFNfK-60) but a subsequent analysis claimed that it may be about 5.7 (with a 95 per cent [confidence interval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval "Confidence interval") of 3.8 to 8.9).[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-mmCQc-61)

In December 2021, the number of cases continued to climb due to several factors, including new COVID-19 variants. As of that 28 December, 282,790,822 individuals worldwide had been confirmed as infected.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-62) As of 14 April 2022[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=COVID-19_pandemic&action=edit), over 500 million cases were confirmed globally.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-63) Most cases are unconfirmed, with the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Health_Metrics_and_Evaluation "Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation") estimating the true number of cases as of early 2022 to be in the billions.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-57percent1-64)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-57percent2-65)

#### Test positivity rate

One measure that public health officials and policymakers have used to monitor the pandemic and guide decision-making is the test positivity rate ("percent positive"). According to Johns Hopkins in 2020, one benchmark for a "too high" per cent positive is 5%, which was used by the WHO in the past.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-66)

Global excess and reported COVID-19 deaths and deaths per 100,000, according to the WHO study[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-10.1038/s41586-022-05522-2-67)

As of 10 March 2023, more than 6.88 million[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-JHU_ticker-10) deaths had been attributed to COVID-19. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AutoDW-25-68) These numbers vary by region and over time, influenced by testing volume, healthcare system quality, treatment options, government response,[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-69) time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics, such as age, sex, and overall health.[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-worldindata-70)

Multiple measures are used to quantify mortality.[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-wBm2a-71) Official death counts typically include people who died after testing positive. Such counts exclude deaths without a test.[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200331reuters-72) Conversely, deaths of people who died from underlying conditions following a positive test may be included.[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-stuff120443722-73) Countries such as Belgium include deaths from suspected cases, including those without a test, thereby increasing counts.[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-npr841005901-74)

Official death counts have been claimed to underreport the actual death toll, because [excess mortality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_displacement "Mortality displacement") (the number of deaths in a period compared to a long-term average) data show an increase in deaths that is not explained by COVID-19 deaths alone.[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-:7-75) Using such data, estimates of the true number of deaths from COVID-19 worldwide have included a range from 18.2 to 33.5 million (≈27.4 million) by 18 November 2023 by _[The Economist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Economist "The Economist")_,[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Economist2023-9)[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-:7-75) as well as over 18.5 million by 1 April 2023 by the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Health_Metrics_and_Evaluation "Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation")[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-COVID-19_Projections-76) and ≈18.2 million (earlier) deaths between 1 January 2020, and 31 December 2021, by a comprehensive international study.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02796-3-77) Such deaths include deaths due to healthcare capacity constraints and priorities, as well as reluctance to seek care (to avoid possible infection).[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200429reason-78) Further research may help distinguish the proportions directly caused by COVID-19 from those caused by indirect consequences of the pandemic.[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-10.1016/S0140-6736(21)02796-3-77)

In May 2022, the WHO estimated the number of excess deaths by the end of 2021 to be 14.9 million compared to 5.4 million reported COVID-19 deaths, with the majority of the unreported 9.5 million deaths believed to be direct deaths due the virus, rather than indirect deaths. Some deaths were because [people with other conditions could not access medical services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_other_health_issues "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on other health issues").[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-79)[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-80)

A December 2022 [WHO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO "WHO") study estimated excess deaths from the pandemic during 2020 and 2021, again concluding ≈14.8 million excess early deaths occurred, reaffirming and detailing their prior calculations from May as well as updating them, addressing criticisms. These numbers do not include measures like [years of potential life lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Years_of_potential_life_lost "Years of potential life lost") and may make the pandemic 2021's [leading cause of death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_causes_of_death_by_rate "List of causes of death by rate").[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-81)[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-82)[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-10.1038/s41586-022-05522-2-67)

The time between symptom onset and death ranges from 6 to 41 days, typically about 14 days.[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-pathogenesis-83) Mortality rates increase as a function of age. People at the greatest mortality risk are the elderly and those with underlying conditions.[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-84)[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-6XONR-85)

#### Infection fatality ratio (IFR)

See also: [List of human disease case fatality rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_disease_case_fatality_rates "List of human disease case fatality rates")

IFR estimate per 

age group[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-EJE_levinetal-86)| Age group | IFR |
| --- | --- |
| 0–34 | 0.004% |
| 35–44 | 0.068% |
| 45–54 | 0.23% |
| 55–64 | 0.75% |
| 65–74 | 2.5% |
| 75–84 | 8.5% |
| 85 + | 28.3% |

The [infection fatality ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_fatality_rate "Infection fatality rate") (IFR) is the cumulative number of deaths attributed to the disease divided by the cumulative number of infected individuals (including asymptomatic and undiagnosed infections and excluding vaccinated infected individuals).[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-fjMw6-87)[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-WHOest-88)[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-ovoEx-89) It is expressed in percentage points.[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-90) Other studies refer to this metric as the _infection fatality risk_.[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-91)[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-92)

In November 2020, a review article in _[Nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature\_(journal) "Nature (journal)")_ reported estimates of population-weighted IFRs for various countries, excluding deaths in elderly care facilities, and found a median range of 0.24% to 1.49%.[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-93) IFRs rise as a function of age (from 0.002% at age 10 and 0.01% at age 25, to 0.4% at age 55, 1.4% at age 65, 4.6% at age 75, and 15% at age 85). These rates vary by a factor of ≈10,000 across the age groups.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-EJE_levinetal-86) For comparison, the IFR for middle-aged adults is two orders of magnitude higher than the annualised risk of a fatal automobile accident and much higher than the risk of dying from [seasonal influenza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seasonal_influenza "Seasonal influenza").[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-EJE_levinetal-86)

In December 2020, a systematic review and meta-analysis estimated that population-weighted IFR was 0.5% to 1% in some countries (France, Netherlands, New Zealand, and Portugal), 1% to 2% in other countries (Australia, England, Lithuania, and Spain), and about 2.5% in Italy. This study reported that most of the differences reflected corresponding differences in the population's age structure and the age-specific pattern of infections.[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-EJE_levinetal-86) There have also been reviews that have compared the fatality rate of this pandemic with prior pandemics, such as MERS-CoV.[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-94)

For comparison the infection mortality rate of seasonal flu in the United States is 0.1%, which is 13 times lower than COVID-19.[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-95)

#### Case fatality ratio (CFR)

Another metric in assessing death rate is the [case fatality ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Case_fatality_rate "Case fatality rate") (CFR),[[a]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-96) which is the ratio of deaths to diagnoses. This metric can be misleading because of the delay between symptom onset and death and because testing focuses on symptomatic individuals.[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Hauser_2020-97)

Based on [Johns Hopkins University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University "Johns Hopkins University") statistics, the global CFR was 1.02 percent (6,881,955 deaths for 676,609,955 cases) as of 10 March 2023.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-JHU_ticker-10) The number varies by region and has generally declined over time.[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-b0L7I-98)

### Variants

Main article: [Variants of SARS-CoV-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variants_of_SARS-CoV-2 "Variants of SARS-CoV-2")

Several variants have been named by WHO and labelled as a [variant of concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_of_concern "Variant of concern") (VoC) or a [variant of interest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_of_interest "Variant of interest") (VoI). Many of these variants have shared the more infectious [D614G](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D614G "D614G"). As of May 2023, the WHO had downgraded all variants of concern to previously circulating as these were no longer detected in new infections.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-99)[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-CDC2-100) Sub-lineages of the Omicron variant (BA.1 – BA.5) were considered separate VoCs by the WHO until they were downgraded in March 2023 as no longer widely circulating.[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-CDC2-100) As of 24 September 2024[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=COVID-19_pandemic&action=edit), the [variants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variants_of_SARS-CoV-2 "Variants of SARS-CoV-2") of interest as specified by the WHO are BA.2.86 and JN.1, and the variants under monitoring are JN.1.7, KP.2, KP.3, KP.3.1.1, JN.1.18, LB.1, and XEC.[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-current_variants2-101)

### Signs and symptoms

Main article: [Symptoms of COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptoms_of_COVID-19 "Symptoms of COVID-19")

[Symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signs_and_symptoms "Signs and symptoms") of COVID-19

Symptoms of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-CDC2020Sym-104)[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Grant_et_al_2020-105) Common symptoms include headache, [loss of smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosmia "Anosmia") and [taste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageusia "Ageusia"), [nasal congestion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasal_obstruction "Nasal obstruction") and [runny nose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinorrhea "Rhinorrhea"), cough, [muscle pain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_pain "Muscle pain"), [sore throat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sore_throat "Sore throat"), fever, [diarrhoea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diarrhea "Diarrhea"), and [breathing difficulties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breathing_difficulties "Breathing difficulties").[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-CDC2020Sym-104) People with the same infection may have different symptoms, and their symptoms may change over time. Three common clusters of symptoms have been identified: one respiratory symptom cluster with cough, [sputum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sputum "Sputum"), shortness of breath, and fever; a musculoskeletal symptom cluster with muscle and joint pain, headache, and fatigue; a cluster of digestive symptoms with abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhoea.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-ECDC-106) In people without prior ear, nose, and throat disorders, [loss of taste](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypogeusia "Hypogeusia") combined with [loss of smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyposmia "Hyposmia") is associated with [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 "COVID-19") and is reported in as many as 88% of cases.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Krishnan-107)[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-108)[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-pmid32483687-109)

### Transmission

Main article: [Transmission of COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_of_COVID-19 "Transmission of COVID-19")

The disease is mainly transmitted via the respiratory route when people inhale droplets and small airborne particles (that form an [aerosol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol "Aerosol")) that infected people exhale as they breathe, talk, cough, sneeze, or sing.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Wang_2021-110)[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-auto-111)[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AR2021-112)[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-auto1-113) Infected people are more likely to transmit COVID-19 when they are physically close to other non-infected individuals. However, infection can occur over longer distances, particularly indoors.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Wang_2021-110)[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Miller_2021-114)

### Cause

Main article: [Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2 "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2")

[![Image 29](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e5/Coronavirus_virion_structure.svg/250px-Coronavirus_virion_structure.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Coronavirus_virion_structure.svg)

Illustration of SARS-CoV-2 [virion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virion "Virion")

SARS‑CoV‑2 belongs to the broad family of viruses known as [coronaviruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus "Coronavirus").[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Fox2020-115) It is a [positive-sense single-stranded RNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-sense_single-stranded_RNA_virus "Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus") (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. Coronaviruses infect humans, other mammals, including livestock and companion animals, and avian species.[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-V'kovskik:21-116)

Human coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [common cold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold "Common cold") to more severe diseases such as [Middle East respiratory syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome "Middle East respiratory syndrome") (MERS, fatality rate ≈34%). SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [229E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_229E "Human coronavirus 229E"), [NL63](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_NL63 "Human coronavirus NL63"), [OC43](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_OC43 "Human coronavirus OC43"), [HKU1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_coronavirus_HKU1 "Human coronavirus HKU1"), [MERS-CoV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome-related_coronavirus "Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus"), and the original [SARS-CoV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus").[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-NEJM-Novel-117)

### Diagnosis

A nurse at [McMurdo Station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMurdo_Station "McMurdo Station") sets up the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing equipment, in September 2020

The standard method of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 is a [nucleic acid test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nucleic_acid_test "Nucleic acid test"),[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200130cdc-118) which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments.[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-WHO_InterimGuidance-119) As these tests detect RNA but not infectious virus, its "ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited".[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-2k0iS-120) The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a [nasopharyngeal swab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasopharyngeal_swab "Nasopharyngeal swab"); however, a nasal swab or sputum sample may also be used.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-CDC2020Testing-121)[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200129cdc-122) The WHO has published several testing protocols for the disease.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-123)

Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include getting vaccinated, staying at home or spending more time outdoors, avoiding crowded places, keeping distance from others, wearing a mask in public, ventilating indoor spaces, managing potential exposure durations, washing hands with soap and water often and for at least twenty seconds, practising good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-cdc-prev-124)[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-who2023-125)

Those diagnosed with COVID-19 or who believe they may be infected are advised by healthcare authorities to stay home except to get medical care, call ahead before visiting a healthcare provider, wear a face mask before entering the healthcare provider's office and when in any room or vehicle with another person, cover coughs and sneezes with a tissue, regularly wash hands with soap and water and avoid sharing personal household items.[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-126)[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-127)[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-128)

A COVID-19 [vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine "Vaccine") is intended to provide [acquired immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_immunity "Acquired immunity") against [severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus_2 "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2") (SARS‑CoV‑2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 ([COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19 "COVID-19")). Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, an established body of knowledge existed about the structure and function of [coronaviruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus "Coronavirus") causing diseases like [severe acute respiratory syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome "Severe acute respiratory syndrome") (SARS) and [Middle East respiratory syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome "Middle East respiratory syndrome") (MERS). This knowledge accelerated the development of various [vaccine platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_platform "Vaccine platform") during early 2020.[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-pmid33341119-129) The initial focus of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines was on preventing symptomatic and severe illness.[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-130) The COVID-19 vaccines are widely credited for their role in reducing the severity and death caused by COVID-19.[[130]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-131)[[131]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-132)

As of March 2023, more than 5.5 billion people had received one or more doses[[132]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-133) (11.8 billion in total) in over 197 countries. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine was the most widely used.[[133]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-134) According to a June 2022 study, COVID-19 vaccines prevented an additional 14.4 million to 19.8 million deaths in 185 countries and territories from 8 December 2020 to 8 December 2021.[[134]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-135)[[135]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-136)

On 8 November 2022, the first recombinant protein-based COVID-19 vaccine (Novavax's booster [Nuvaxovid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuvaxovid "Nuvaxovid")) was authorised for use in adults in the United Kingdom. It has subsequently received endorsement/authorisation from the WHO, US, European Union, and Australia.[[136]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-137)[[137]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-138)

On 12 November 2022, the WHO released its Global Vaccine Market Report. The report indicated that "inequitable distribution is not unique to COVID-19 vaccines"; countries that are not economically strong struggle to obtain vaccines.[[138]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-139)

On 14 November 2022, the first inhalable vaccine was introduced, developed by Chinese biopharmaceutical company [CanSino Biologics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CanSino_Biologics#COVID-19_vaccine_development "CanSino Biologics"), in the city of Shanghai, China.[[139]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-140)

### Treatment

A critically ill patient receiving invasive ventilation in the intensive care unit of the [Heart Institute, University of São Paulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Institute,_University_of_S%C3%A3o_Paulo "Heart Institute, University of São Paulo") in July 2020. Due to a shortage of mechanical ventilators, a [bridge ventilator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resuscitator "Resuscitator") is being used to automatically actuate a [bag valve mask](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_valve_mask "Bag valve mask")

For the first two years of the pandemic, no specific and effective treatment or cure was available.[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-BMJLivingReview-141)[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-cdcmuseum-142) In 2021, the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) approved the oral antiviral [protease inhibitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protease_inhibitor_(pharmacology) "Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)"), [Paxlovid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxlovid "Paxlovid") (nirmatrelvir plus the HIV antiviral [ritonavir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritonavir "Ritonavir")), to treat adult patients.[[142]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-143) FDA later gave it an EUA.[[143]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-144)

Most cases of COVID-19 are mild. In these, supportive care includes medication such as [paracetamol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracetamol "Paracetamol") or [NSAIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSAID "NSAID") to relieve symptoms (fever,[[144]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-145) body aches, cough), adequate intake of oral fluids and rest.[[141]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-cdcmuseum-142)[[145]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-146) Good personal hygiene and a [healthy diet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Healthy_diet "Healthy diet") are also recommended.[[146]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-147)

[Supportive care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supportive_care "Supportive care") in severe cases includes treatment to [relieve symptoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symptomatic_treatment "Symptomatic treatment"), [fluid therapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_replacement "Fluid replacement"), [oxygen support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_support "Oxygen support") and [prone positioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prone_positioning "Prone positioning"), and medications or devices to support other affected vital organs.[[147]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-148) More severe cases may need treatment in hospital. In those with low oxygen levels, use of the glucocorticoid [dexamethasone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone "Dexamethasone") is recommended to reduce mortality.[[148]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-149)[Noninvasive ventilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noninvasive_ventilation "Noninvasive ventilation") and, ultimately, admission to an [intensive care unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit "Intensive care unit") for [mechanical ventilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_ventilation "Mechanical ventilation") may be required to support breathing.[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-NIHGuidelines2020-150)[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extracorporeal_membrane_oxygenation "Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation") (ECMO) has been used to address the issue of respiratory failure.[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Guan_Ni_Hu_Liang_p.-151)[[151]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Henry_2020_p.-152)

Existing drugs such as [hydroxychloroquine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxychloroquine "Hydroxychloroquine"), [lopinavir/ritonavir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lopinavir/ritonavir "Lopinavir/ritonavir"), and [ivermectin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivermectin "Ivermectin") are not recommended by US or European health authorities, as there is no good evidence they have any useful effect.[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-BMJLivingReview-141)[[152]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Kim_Read_Fauci_p=2149-153)[[153]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-NIHGuidelinesTherapeuticManagement-154) The antiviral [remdesivir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remdesivir "Remdesivir") is available in the US, Canada, Australia, and several other countries, with varying restrictions; however, it is not recommended for use with mechanical ventilation, and is discouraged altogether by the WHO,[[154]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Hsu_p=m4457-155) due to limited evidence of its efficacy.[[140]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-BMJLivingReview-141)

### Prognosis

Further information: [COVID-19 §Prognosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19#Prognosis "COVID-19"), and [Long COVID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_COVID "Long COVID")

The severity of COVID-19 varies. It may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the [common cold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold "Common cold"). In 3–4% of cases (7.4% for those over age 65) symptoms are severe enough to cause hospitalisation.[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-pmid33087398-156) Mild cases typically recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to recover. Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks. Prolonged [prothrombin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prothrombin "Prothrombin") time and elevated [C-reactive protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C-reactive_protein "C-reactive protein") levels on admission to the hospital are associated with severe course of COVID-19 and with a transfer to [intensive care units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intensive_care_unit "Intensive care unit") (ICU).[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-157)[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-158)

Between 5% and 50% of COVID-19 patients experience [long COVID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_COVID "Long COVID"),[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-159) a condition characterised by long-term [consequences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequela "Sequela") persisting after the typical convalescence period of the disease.[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-160)[[160]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-161) The most commonly reported clinical presentations are [fatigue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatigue "Fatigue") and memory problems, as well as [malaise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaise "Malaise"), headaches, [shortness of breath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortness_of_breath "Shortness of breath"), loss of smell, [muscle weakness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscle_weakness "Muscle weakness"), low fever and [cognitive dysfunction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dysfunction "Cognitive dysfunction").[[161]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-ref1-162)[[162]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-163)[[163]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-164)[[164]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-165)

Strategies
----------

Main article: [Public health mitigation of COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health_mitigation_of_COVID-19 "Public health mitigation of COVID-19")

[![Image 34](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/20200410_Flatten_the_curve%2C_raise_the_line_-_pandemic_%28English%29.gif/500px-20200410_Flatten_the_curve%2C_raise_the_line_-_pandemic_%28English%29.gif)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:20200410_Flatten_the_curve,_raise_the_line_-_pandemic_(English).gif)

Goals of mitigation include delaying and reducing peak burden on healthcare (_[flattening the curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattening\_the\_curve "Flattening the curve")_) and lessening overall cases and health impact.[[165]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Lancet2020Flatten-166)[[166]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-RnW59-167) Moreover, progressively greater increases in healthcare capacity (_[raising the line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raising\_the\_line "Raising the line")_) such as by increasing bed count, personnel, and equipment, help to meet increased demand[[167]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Vox_20200407-168)

Many countries attempted to slow or stop the spread of COVID-19 by recommending, mandating or prohibiting behaviour changes, while others relied primarily on providing information. Measures ranged from public advisories to stringent lockdowns. Outbreak control strategies are divided into elimination and mitigation. Experts differentiate between elimination strategies (known as "[zero-COVID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-COVID "Zero-COVID")") that aim to completely stop the spread of the virus within the community,[[168]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Barcelona-169) and mitigation strategies (commonly known as "[flattening the curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattening_the_curve "Flattening the curve")") that attempt to lessen the effects of the virus on society, but which still tolerate some level of transmission within the community.[[169]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Livermore-170) These initial strategies can be pursued sequentially or simultaneously during the [acquired immunity phase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquired_immunity "Acquired immunity") through natural and [vaccine-induced immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_vaccine "COVID-19 vaccine").[[170]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Bhopal2020-171)

_Nature_ reported in 2021 that 90% of researchers who responded to a survey "think that the coronavirus will become [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_(epidemiology) "Endemic (epidemiology)")".[[171]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-172)

### Containment

Further information: [Zero-COVID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-COVID "Zero-COVID")

Containment is undertaken to stop an outbreak from spreading into the general population. Infected individuals are isolated while they are infectious. The people they have interacted with are contacted and isolated for long enough to ensure that they are either not infected or no longer contagious. Screening is the starting point for containment. Screening is done by checking for symptoms to identify infected individuals, who can then be isolated or offered treatment.[[172]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-f4SpW-173) The zero-COVID strategy involves using public health measures such as [contact tracing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing "Contact tracing"), [mass testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_testing "COVID-19 testing"), [border quarantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Travel during the COVID-19 pandemic"), [lockdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns "COVID-19 lockdowns"), and [mitigation software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_and_development_of_software_for_COVID-19_pandemic_mitigation "Use and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation") to stop [community transmission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_of_COVID-19 "Transmission of COVID-19") of COVID-19 as soon as it is detected, with the goal of getting the area back to zero detected infections and resuming normal economic and social activities.[[168]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Barcelona-169)[[173]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Lancet-Li-2020-174) Successful containment or suppression reduces [Rt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_reproduction_number#Effective_reproduction_number "Basic reproduction number") to less than 1.[[174]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-ImpCollege16mar2020-175)

### Mitigation

Further information: [Flattening the curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattening_the_curve "Flattening the curve")

Should containment fail, efforts focus on mitigation: measures taken to slow the spread and limit its effects on the healthcare system and society. Successful mitigation delays and decreases the epidemic peak, known as "flattening the [epidemic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epidemic_curve "Epidemic curve")".[[165]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Lancet2020Flatten-166) This decreases the risk of overwhelming health services and provides more time for developing vaccines and treatments.[[165]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Lancet2020Flatten-166) Individual behaviour changed in many jurisdictions. Many people worked from home instead of at their traditional workplaces.[[175]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-176)

#### Non-pharmaceutical interventions

[![Image 35](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/38/04.02_%E7%B8%BD%E7%B5%B1%E8%A6%96%E5%AF%9F%E3%80%8C%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%AE%E6%B5%81%E8%A1%8C%E7%96%AB%E6%83%85%E6%8C%87%E6%8F%AE%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83%E3%80%8D_49726568957_66543b616e_o.jpg/250px-04.02_%E7%B8%BD%E7%B5%B1%E8%A6%96%E5%AF%9F%E3%80%8C%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%AE%E6%B5%81%E8%A1%8C%E7%96%AB%E6%83%85%E6%8C%87%E6%8F%AE%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83%E3%80%8D_49726568957_66543b616e_o.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:04.02_%E7%B8%BD%E7%B5%B1%E8%A6%96%E5%AF%9F%E3%80%8C%E4%B8%AD%E5%A4%AE%E6%B5%81%E8%A1%8C%E7%96%AB%E6%83%85%E6%8C%87%E6%8F%AE%E4%B8%AD%E5%BF%83%E3%80%8D_49726568957_66543b616e_o.jpg)

The CDC and WHO advise that masks (such as worn here by Taiwanese president [Tsai Ing-wen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsai_Ing-wen "Tsai Ing-wen")) reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2

[Non-pharmaceutical interventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-pharmaceutical_intervention "Non-pharmaceutical intervention") that may reduce spread include personal actions such as wearing [face masks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face_masks_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic"), self-quarantine, and [hand hygiene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hand_washing "Hand washing"); community measures aimed at reducing interpersonal contacts such as closing workplaces and schools and cancelling large gatherings; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning.[[176]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-community_mitigation-177)

#### Other measures

More drastic actions, such as quarantining entire populations and strict travel bans have been attempted in various jurisdictions.[[177]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-RwmYm-178) The [Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_government_response_to_COVID-19 "Chinese government response to COVID-19") and [Australian government approaches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Australia#Responses "COVID-19 pandemic in Australia") have included many lockdowns and are widely considered the most strict. The [New Zealand government response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_government_response_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic "New Zealand government response to the COVID-19 pandemic") included the most severe travel restrictions. As part of its [K-Quarantine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-Quarantine "K-Quarantine") programme, South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. The [Singaporean government's response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Singapore#Government_response "COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore") included so-called "[circuit breaker lockdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_Singapore_circuit_breaker_measures "2020 Singapore circuit breaker measures")" and financial support for those affected while also imposing large fines for those who broke quarantine.[[178]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-shZdf-179)

#### Contact tracing

See also: [Use and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_and_development_of_software_for_COVID-19_pandemic_mitigation "Use and development of software for COVID-19 pandemic mitigation") and [Public health mitigation of COVID-19 §Information technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health_mitigation_of_COVID-19#Information_technology "Public health mitigation of COVID-19")

[Contact tracing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing "Contact tracing") attempts to identify recent contacts of newly infected individuals, and to screen them for infection; the traditional approach is to request a list of contacts from infectees, and then telephone or visit the contacts.[[179]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-web-180) Contact tracing was widely used during the [Western African Ebola virus epidemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_African_Ebola_virus_epidemic "Western African Ebola virus epidemic") in 2014.[[180]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-181)

Another approach is to collect location data from mobile devices to identify those who have come in significant contact with infectees, which prompted privacy concerns.[[181]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-IngramWard20200407-182) On 10 April 2020, Google and [Apple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc. "Apple Inc.") announced an initiative for privacy-preserving contact tracing.[[182]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-0DF25-183)[[183]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200410apple-184) In Europe and in the US, [Palantir Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies "Palantir Technologies") initially provided COVID-19 tracking services.[[184]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-0k3hR-185)

### Health care

Novel devices were created such as [ear savers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ear_saver "Ear saver"), [non-invasive ventilation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-invasive_ventilation "Non-invasive ventilation") helmets, and ventilator splitters.[[191]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-192)

### Herd immunity

In July 2021, several experts expressed concern that achieving [herd immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity "Herd immunity") may not be possible because Delta can transmit among vaccinated individuals.[[192]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-:1-193) CDC published data showing that vaccinated people could transmit Delta, something officials believed was less likely with other variants. Consequently, WHO and CDC encouraged vaccinated people to continue with non-pharmaceutical interventions such as masking, social distancing, and quarantining if exposed.[[193]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-:2-194)

Main article: [Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_2019 "Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2019")

The [outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outbreak "Outbreak") was discovered in Wuhan in November 2019. It is possible that human-to-human transmission was happening before the discovery.[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Hu2020natureReviews-38)[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Graham2020immunity-39) Based on a retrospective analysis starting from December 2019, the number of cases in Hubei gradually increased, reaching 60 by 20 December and at least 266 by 31 December.[[194]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-original_report-195) A [pneumonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumonia "Pneumonia") cluster was observed on 26 December and treated by Chinese pulmonologist [Zhang Jixian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zhang_Jixian "Zhang Jixian"). She informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on 27 December.[[195]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-D54YB-196) After analysing pneumonia patient samples, a genetic sequencing company named Vision Medicals reported the discovery of a [novel coronavirus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel_coronavirus "Novel coronavirus") to the [China CDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Center_for_Disease_Control_and_Prevention "Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention") (CCDC) on 28 December.[[196]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AP_OR-197)[[197]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-caixintrace-198) Two days later, a test report from CapitalBio Medlab addressed to the [Wuhan Central Hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Hospital_of_Wuhan "Central Hospital of Wuhan") reported an erroneous positive result for [SARS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS "SARS"), causing doctors there to alert authorities. Eight of those doctors, including ophthalmologist [Li Wenliang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Wenliang "Li Wenliang") (1985–2020), were detained by police on 3 January for "spreading false rumours".[[198]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-siStf-199) That evening, Wuhan Municipal Health Commission (WMHC) issued a notice about "the treatment of pneumonia of unknown cause".[[199]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-promedmail6864153-200) The next day, WMHC made the announcement public, confirming 27 cases[[200]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AutoDW-69-201)[[201]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AutoDW-68-202)—enough to trigger an investigation.[[202]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-bbc50984025-203) On 31 December, the WHO office in China was notified about the cluster of unknown pneumonia cases[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-WHO_report-21)[[200]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AutoDW-69-201) and immediately launched an investigation.[[202]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-bbc50984025-203)

Official Chinese sources claimed that the early cases were mostly linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sold live animals.[[203]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-characteristicsZH-204) In May 2020, CCDC director George Gao initially ruled out the market as a possible origin, as animal samples collected there had tested negative.[[204]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-ALmAQ-205)

On 11 January, WHO was notified by the Chinese National Health Commission that the outbreak was associated with exposures in the market, and that China had identified a new type of coronavirus, which it isolated on 7 January.[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-WHO_report-21)

Initially, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.[[205]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Qun29Jan2020-206) In early and mid-January, the virus spread to other [Chinese provinces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provinces_of_China "Provinces of China"), helped by the [Chinese New Year migration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunyun "Chunyun"). Wuhan was a transport hub and major rail interchange.[[206]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-WHO_report_28_February_2020-207) On 10 January, the virus' genome was shared publicly.[[207]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-208) A retrospective study published in March found that 6,174 people had reported symptoms by 20 January.[[208]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Epidemiology17Feb2020-209) A 24 January report indicated human transmission was likely occurring, and recommended [personal protective equipment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment "Personal protective equipment") for health workers. It also advocated testing, given the outbreak's "pandemic potential".[[209]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Huang24Jan2020-210)[[210]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Horton_18_March-211) On 30 January, 7,818 infections had been confirmed, leading WHO to declare the outbreak a [Public Health Emergency of International Concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health_Emergency_of_International_Concern "Public Health Emergency of International Concern") (PHEIC),[[211]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-WHO_PHEICSR-212)[[212]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-WHO_PHEIC_decl2-213)[[213]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-214) upgrading it to a pandemic on 11 March.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-start-3) On 31 January, the first published modelling study warned of inevitable "independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally" and called for "large-scale public health interventions".[[214]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-pmid32014114-215)

By 31 January, Italy indicated its first confirmed infections had occurred, in two tourists from China.[[215]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Corriere_20Jan-216) The WHO announced on 11 March its assessment that the situation could be characterised as a pandemic.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-start-3) On 19 March, Italy overtook China as the country with the most reported deaths.[[216]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-sky11960412-217)

In October, WHO reported that one in ten people around the world may have been infected, or 780 million people, while only 35 million infections had been confirmed.[[222]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-bbc_oneinten-223)

On 9 November, Pfizer released trial results for a candidate vaccine, showing a 90 per cent effectiveness in preventing infection. That day, Novavax submitted an FDA Fast Track application for their vaccine.[[223]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-FEv4C-224)[[224]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-NPZ5P-225) On 14 December, [Public Health England](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Health_England "Public Health England") reported that a variant had been discovered in the UK's southeast, predominantly in [Kent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent "Kent"). The variant, later named [Alpha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_of_Concern_202012/01 "Variant of Concern 202012/01"), showed changes to the [spike protein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_spike_protein "Coronavirus spike protein") that could make the virus more infectious. As of 13 December, 1,108 infections had been confirmed in the UK.[[225]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-226)[[226]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-227) On 4 February 2020, US Secretary of Health and Human Services [Alex Azar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Azar "Alex Azar") waived liability for vaccine manufacturers in all cases except those involving "willful misconduct".[[227]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-mXTUz-228)[[228]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-229)

On 1 January, Europe passed 100 million cases amidst a surge in the [Omicron variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant").[[240]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-241) Later that month, the WHO recommended the [rheumatoid arthritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis "Rheumatoid arthritis") drug [Baricitinib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baricitinib "Baricitinib") for severe or critical patients. It also recommended the monoclonal antibody [Sotrovimab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sotrovimab "Sotrovimab") in patients with non-severe disease, but only those who are at highest risk of hospitalisation.[[241]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-242)

On 24 January, the [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_for_Health_Metrics_and_Evaluation "Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation") estimated that about 57% of the world's population had been infected by COVID-19.[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-57percent1-64)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-57percent2-65) By 6 March, it was reported that the total worldwide death count had surpassed 6 million people.[[242]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-243) By 6 July, Omicron subvariants [BA.4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BA.4 "BA.4") and [BA.5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BA.5 "BA.5") had spread worldwide.[[243]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-244) WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus stated on 14 September 2022, that "[The world has] never been in a better position to end the pandemic", citing the lowest number of weekly reported deaths since March 2020. He continued, "We are not there yet. But the end is in sight—we can see the finish line".[[244]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-245)[[245]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-246)[[246]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-247)[[247]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-248)

On 21 October, the United States surpassed 99 million cases of COVID-19, the most cases of any country.[[248]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-249) By 30 October, the worldwide daily death toll was 424, the lowest since 385 deaths were reported on 12 March 2020.[[249]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-250) 17 November marked the three-year anniversary since health officials in China first detected COVID-19.[[250]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-251)

On 11 November, the WHO reported that deaths since the month of February had dropped 90 per cent. Director-General Tedros said this was "cause for optimism".[[251]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-252) On 3 December, the WHO indicated that, "at least 90% of the world's population has some level of immunity to Sars-CoV-2".[[252]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-253) In early December, China began lifting some of its most stringent lockdown measures. Subsequent data from China's health authorities revealed that 248 million people, nearly 18 per cent of its population, had been infected in the first 20 days of that month.[[253]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-254) On 29 December, the US joined Italy, Japan, Taiwan and India in requiring negative COVID-19 test results from all people travelling from China due to the new surge in cases. The EU refused similar measures, stating that the BF7 omicron variant had already spread throughout Europe without becoming dominant.[[254]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-255)[[255]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-256)

### 2023

[Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_in_2023 "Timeline of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2023")

On 4 January 2023, the WHO said the information shared by China during the recent surge in infections lacked data, such as hospitalisation rates.[[256]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-257) On 10 January, the WHO's Europe office said the recent viral surge in China posed "no immediate threat."[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-258) On 16 January, the WHO recommended that China monitor excess mortality to provide "a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of COVID-19".[[258]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-259)

On 30 January, the three-year anniversary of the original declaration, the WHO determined that COVID-19 still met the criteria for a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC).[[259]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-260)

On 19 March, WHO Director-General Tedros indicated he was "confident" the COVID-19 pandemic would cease to be a public health emergency by the end of the year.[[260]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-261) On 5 May, the WHO downgraded COVID-19 from being a global health emergency, though it continued to refer to it as a pandemic.[[261]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-262) The WHO does not make official declarations of when pandemics end.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-reuters-4)[[262]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-guardian-263) The decision came after Tedros convened with the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee, wherein the Committee noted that due to the decrease in deaths and hospitalisations, and the prevalence of vaccinations and the level of general immunity, it was time to remove the emergency designation and "transition to long-term management".[[263]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-WHO_Statement_5_May_2023-264) Tedros agreed, and the WHO reduced the classification to an "established and ongoing health issue".[[263]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-WHO_Statement_5_May_2023-264) In a press conference, Tedros remarked that the diminishing threat from COVID-19 had "allowed most countries to return to life as we knew it before COVID-19".[[264]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-npr-265)

In September the WHO said it had observed "concerning" trends in COVID-19 case numbers and hospitalisations, although analysis was hampered because many countries were no longer recording COVID-19 case statistics.[[265]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-266)

In November 2023, in response to viral mutations and changing characteristics of infection, the WHO adjusted its treatment guidelines. Among other changes, remdesivir and molnupiravir were now recommended only for the most severe cases, and [deuremidevir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuremidevir "Deuremidevir") and ivermectin were recommended against.[[266]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-267)

Main articles: [COVID-19 lockdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns "COVID-19 lockdowns"), [COVID-19 pandemic by country and territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_by_country_and_territory "COVID-19 pandemic by country and territory"), and [National responses to the COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_responses_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic "National responses to the COVID-19 pandemic")

National reactions ranged from strict lockdowns to public education campaigns.[[267]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-IVdfl-268) WHO recommended that curfews and lockdowns should be short-term measures to reorganise, regroup, rebalance resources, and protect the health care system.[[268]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-58tIM-269) As of 26 March 2020, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown.[[269]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-theguardian500000-270) This increased to 3.9 billion people by the first week of April—more than half the [world's population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population "World population").[[270]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200403euronews-271)[[271]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200328businessinsider-272)

In several countries, [protests rose against restrictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protests_against_responses_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Protests against responses to the COVID-19 pandemic") such as lockdowns. A February 2021 study found that protests against restrictions were likely to directly increase the spread of the virus.[[272]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-273)

### Asia

Main article: [COVID-19 pandemic in Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Asia "COVID-19 pandemic in Asia")

As of the end of 2021, Asia's peak had come at the same time and at the same level as the world as a whole, in May 2021.[[273]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-274) However, cumulatively they had experienced only half of the global average in cases.[[274]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-275)

A [temporary hospital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fangcang_Hospital "Fangcang Hospital") constructed in Wuhan in February 2020

China opted for containment, instituting strict lockdowns to eliminate viral spread.[[275]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-:02-276)[[276]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-277) The vaccines distributed in China included the [BIBP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinopharm_BIBP_COVID-19_vaccine "Sinopharm BIBP COVID-19 vaccine"), [WIBP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinopharm_WIBP_COVID-19_vaccine "Sinopharm WIBP COVID-19 vaccine"), and [CoronaVac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoronaVac "CoronaVac").[[277]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-278) It was reported on 11 December 2021, that China had vaccinated 1.162 billion of its citizens, or 82.5% of the total population of the country against COVID-19.[[278]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-279) China's large-scale adoption of [zero-COVID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-COVID "Zero-COVID") had largely contained the first waves of infections of the disease.[[275]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-:02-276)[[279]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-280)[[280]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-281) When the waves of infections due to the [Omicron variant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant") followed, China was almost alone in pursuing the strategy of zero-Covid to combat the spread of the virus in 2022.[[281]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-282) Lockdown continued to be employed in November to combat a new wave of cases;[[282]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-283)[[283]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-284) however, [protests erupted in cities across China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_COVID-19_protests_in_China "2022 COVID-19 protests in China") over the country's stringent measures,[[284]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-285)[[285]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-286) and in December that year, the country relaxed its zero-COVID policy.[[286]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-287) On 20 December 2022, the Chinese State Council narrowed its definition of what would be counted as a COVID-19 death to include solely respiratory failure, which led to scepticism by health experts of the government's total death count[[287]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-288)[[288]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-289) at a time when hospitals reported being overwhelmed with cases following the abrupt discontinuation of zero-COVID.[[289]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-290)

The first case in India was reported on 30 January 2020. India ordered a nationwide lockdown starting 24 March 2020,[[290]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-mrGsK-291) with a phased unlock beginning 1 June 2020. Six cities accounted for around half of reported cases—[Mumbai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Maharashtra "COVID-19 pandemic in Maharashtra"), [Delhi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Delhi "COVID-19 pandemic in Delhi"), [Ahmedabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Gujarat "COVID-19 pandemic in Gujarat"), [Chennai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Tamil_Nadu "COVID-19 pandemic in Tamil Nadu"), [Pune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Maharashtra "COVID-19 pandemic in Maharashtra") and [Kolkata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_West_Bengal "COVID-19 pandemic in West Bengal").[[291]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-sHMHJ-292) Post-lockdown, the Government of India introduced a contact tracking app called [Aarogya Setu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aarogya_Setu "Aarogya Setu") to help authorities manage contact tracing and vaccine distribution.[[292]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-293) India's vaccination programme was considered to be the world's largest and most successful with over 90% of citizens getting the first dose and another 65% getting the second dose.[[293]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-294)[[294]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-295) A second wave hit India in April 2021, straining healthcare services.[[295]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-296) On 21 October 2021, it was reported that the country had surpassed 1 billion vaccinations.[[296]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-297)

Disinfection of [Tehran Metro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran_Metro "Tehran Metro") trains to prevent COVID-19 transmission. Similar measures have also been taken in other countries.[[297]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-2kQpo-298)

Iran reported its first confirmed cases on 19 February 2020, in [Qom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qom "Qom").[[298]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-wHBRB-299)[[299]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-4yrqM-300) Early measures included the cancellation/closure of concerts and other cultural events,[[300]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Xm5nq-301) Friday prayers,[[301]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Urdn6-302) and school and university campuses.[[302]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-2YX6a-303) Iran became a centre of the pandemic in February 2020.[[303]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-HHOnl-304)[[304]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-New_Yorker-305) More than ten countries had traced their outbreaks to Iran by 28 February, indicating a more severe outbreak than the 388 reported cases.[[304]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-New_Yorker-305)[[305]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-D2Xpc-306) The [Iranian Parliament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Consultative_Assembly "Islamic Consultative Assembly") closed, after 23 of its 290 members tested positive on 3 March 2020.[[306]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-fXv2K-307) At least twelve sitting or former Iranian politicians and government officials had died by 17 March 2020.[[307]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-oxtUC-308) By August 2021, the pandemic's fifth wave peaked, with more than 400 deaths in 1 day.[[308]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-309)

COVID-19 was confirmed in South Korea on 20 January 2020. Military bases were quarantined after tests showed three infected soldiers.[[309]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-b82186-310) South Korea introduced what was then considered the world's largest and best-organised screening programme, isolating infected people, and tracing and quarantining contacts.[[310]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-science20200317-311) Screening methods included mandatory self-reporting by new international arrivals through mobile application,[[311]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-nbcnews1167376-312) combined with [drive-through](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drive-through "Drive-through") testing,[[312]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-CvyZS-313) and increasing testing capability to 20,000 people/day.[[313]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-fdhQW-314) Despite some early criticisms,[[314]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-imx38-315) South Korea's programme was considered a success in controlling the outbreak without quarantining entire cities.[[310]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-science20200317-311)[[315]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Wypis-316)[[316]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-joins23778577-317)

Deaths per 100,000 residents

The COVID-19 pandemic arrived in Europe with its first confirmed case in [Bordeaux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordeaux "Bordeaux"), [France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_France "COVID-19 pandemic in France"), on 24 January 2020, and subsequently spread widely across the continent. By 17 March 2020, every country in Europe had confirmed a case,[[317]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-318) and all had reported at least one death, with the exception of [Vatican City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Vatican_City "COVID-19 pandemic in Vatican City"). Italy was the first European nation to experience a major outbreak in early 2020, becoming the first country worldwide to introduce a national [lockdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdowns_in_Italy "COVID-19 lockdowns in Italy").[[318]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-319) By 13 March 2020, the WHO declared Europe the epicentre of the pandemic[[319]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-320)[[320]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-321) and it remained so until the WHO announced it had been overtaken by [South America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_South_America "COVID-19 pandemic in South America") on 22 May.[[321]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-322) By 18 March 2020, more than 250 million people were in [lockdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stay-at-home_order "Stay-at-home order") in Europe.[[322]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-323) Despite [deployment of COVID-19 vaccines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_of_COVID-19_vaccines "Deployment of COVID-19 vaccines"), Europe became the pandemic's epicentre once again in late 2021.[[323]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-324)[[324]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-325)

The [Italian outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Italy "COVID-19 pandemic in Italy") began on 31 January 2020, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.[[215]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Corriere_20Jan-216) Cases began to rise sharply, which prompted the government to suspend flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.[[325]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-thelocal-flight-326) On 22 February 2020, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree-law to contain the outbreak, which quarantined more than 50,000 people in northern Italy.[[326]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AutoDW-201-327) On 4 March, the Italian government ordered schools and universities closed as Italy reached a hundred deaths.

As a result of the high transmissibility of the Delta variant, however, by August 2021, the Australian states of [New South Wales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales "New South Wales") and [Victoria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_(Australia) "Victoria (Australia)") had conceded defeat in their eradication efforts.[[405]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-406) In early October 2021, New Zealand also abandoned its elimination strategy.[[406]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-The_Guardian_NZ_abandons_elimination-407) In November and December, following vaccination efforts, the remaining states of Australia, excluding Western Australia, voluntarily gave up [COVID-Zero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-COVID "Zero-COVID") to open up state and international borders.[[407]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-408)[[408]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-409)[[409]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-410) The open borders allowed the Omicron variant of COVID-19 to enter quickly, and cases subsequently exceeded 120,000 a day.[[410]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-411) By early March 2022, with cases exceeding 1,000 a day, Western Australia conceded defeat in its eradication strategy and opened its borders.[[411]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-412) Despite record cases, Australian jurisdictions slowly removed restrictions such as close contact isolation, mask wearing, and density limits by April 2022.[[412]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-413)

On 9 September 2022, restrictions were significantly relaxed. The aircraft mask mandate was scrapped nationwide, and daily reporting transitioned to weekly reporting.[[413]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-414)[[414]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-415)[[415]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-416) On 14 September, COVID-19 disaster payment for isolating persons was extended for mandatory isolation.[[416]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-417) By 22 September, all states had ended mask mandates on public transport, including in Victoria, where the mandate had lasted for approximately 800 days.[[417]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-418) On 30 September 2022, all Australian leaders declared the emergency response finished and announced the end of isolation requirements. These changes were due in part to high levels of 'hybrid immunity' and low case numbers.[[418]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-419)

### Antarctica

Main article: [COVID-19 pandemic in Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Antarctica "COVID-19 pandemic in Antarctica")

Due to its remoteness and sparse population, [Antarctica](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctica "Antarctica") was the last continent to have confirmed cases of COVID-19.[[419]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-420)[[420]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-421)[[421]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-422) The first cases were reported in December 2020, almost a year after the first cases of COVID-19 were detected in China. At least 36 people were infected in the first outbreak in 2020,[[422]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-423) with several other outbreaks taking place in 2021 and 2022.[[423]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-424)

### United Nations

Main article: [United Nations response to the COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_response_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic "United Nations response to the COVID-19 pandemic")

The [United Nations Conference on Trade and Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Conference_on_Trade_and_Development "United Nations Conference on Trade and Development") (UNSC) was criticised for its slow response, especially regarding the UN's [global ceasefire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_ceasefire "Global ceasefire"), which aimed to open up humanitarian access to conflict zones.[[424]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-:22-425)[[425]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Krm4a-426) The United Nations Security Council was criticised due to the inadequate manner in which it dealt with the COVID-19 pandemic, namely the poor ability to create international collaboration during this crisis.[[426]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-427)[[427]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-428)

On 23 March 2020, United Nations Secretary-General [António Manuel de Oliveira Guterres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant%C3%B3nio_Guterres "António Guterres") appealed for a global [ceasefire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceasefire "Ceasefire");[[428]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-tFb4N-429)[[429]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-lzoeV-430) 172 UN member states and observers signed a non-binding supporting statement in June,[[430]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AGhvz-431) and the [UN Security Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council "UN Security Council") passed a [resolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council_Resolution_2532 "United Nations Security Council Resolution 2532") supporting it in July.[[431]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-9rN79-432)[[432]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-nJTuX-433)

On 29 September 2020, Guterres urged the [International Monetary Fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Monetary_Fund "International Monetary Fund") to help certain countries via debt relief and also call for countries to increase contributions to develop vaccines.[[433]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-434)

The pandemic shook the world's economy, with especially severe economic damage in the United States, Europe and Latin America.[[436]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-437)[[437]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Effect_of_COVID-19_on_food_security-438) A consensus report by American intelligence agencies in April 2021 concluded, "Efforts to contain and manage the virus have reinforced nationalist trends globally, as some states turned inward to protect their citizens and sometimes cast blame on marginalised groups". COVID-19 inflamed partisanship and polarisation around the world as bitter arguments exploded over how to respond. International trade was disrupted amid the formation of no-entry enclaves.[[438]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-439)

### Travel restrictions

Main article: [Travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travel_restrictions_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Travel restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic")

The pandemic led many countries and regions to impose quarantines, entry bans, or other restrictions, either for citizens, recent travellers to affected areas,[[439]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200326nytimes-440) or for all travellers.[[440]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-441)[[441]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-442) Travel collapsed worldwide, damaging the travel sector. The effectiveness of travel restrictions was questioned as the virus spread across the world.[[442]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200224nationalgeographic-443) One study found that travel restrictions only modestly affected the initial spread, unless combined with other [infection prevention and control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infection_prevention_and_control "Infection prevention and control") measures.[[443]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-DJYtB-444)[[444]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-445) Researchers concluded that "travel restrictions are most useful in the early and late phase of an epidemic" and "restrictions of travel from Wuhan unfortunately came too late".[[445]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-283GD-446) The European Union rejected the idea of suspending the [Schengen free travel zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schengen_Agreement "Schengen Agreement").[[446]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-dw52497811-447)[[447]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200313euractiv-448)

Ukraine evacuates Ukrainian citizens from [Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan "Wuhan"), China.

Several countries repatriated their citizens and diplomatic staff from Wuhan and surrounding areas, primarily through [charter flights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_charter "Air charter"). Canada, the United States, Japan, India, Sri Lanka, Australia, France, Argentina, Germany and Thailand were among the first to do so.[[448]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AutoDW-169-449) Brazil and New Zealand evacuated their own nationals and others.[[449]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AutoDW-171-450)[[450]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-6l9jG-451) On 14 March, South Africa repatriated 112 South Africans who tested negative, while four who showed symptoms were left behind.[[451]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-auto3-452) Pakistan declined to evacuate its citizens.[[452]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200131dialoguepakistan-453)

On 15 February, the US announced it would evacuate Americans aboard the _[Diamond Princess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond\_Princess\_outbreak "Diamond Princess outbreak")_ cruise ship,[[453]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AutoDW-174-454) and on 21 February, Canada evacuated 129 Canadians from the ship.[[454]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AutoDW-175-455) In early March, the Indian government began repatriating its citizens from Iran.[[455]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-czjOG-456)[[456]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-indiatimes74647353-457) On 20 March, the United States began to withdraw some troops from Iraq.[[457]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-USWithdraw-458)

A [stock index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_index "Stock index") chart shows the [2020 stock market crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_stock_market_crash "2020 stock market crash").

The pandemic and responses to it damaged the global economy. On 27 February 2020, worries about the outbreak crushed US stock indexes, which posted their sharpest falls since 2008.[[458]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-U7teI-459)

Tourism collapsed due to travel restrictions, closing of public places including travel attractions, and advice of governments against travel. Airlines cancelled flights, while British regional airline [Flybe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flybe_(1979%E2%80%932020) "Flybe (1979–2020)") collapsed.[[459]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-z2VrM-460) The cruise line industry was hard hit,[[460]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-smh20200227-461) and train stations and ferry ports closed.[[461]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-wnn7L-462) International mail stopped or was delayed.[[462]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-wsj1158868721-463)

The retail sector faced reductions in store hours or closures.[[463]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-464) Retailers in Europe and Latin America faced traffic declines of 40 per cent. North America and Middle East retailers saw a 50–60 per cent drop.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200402aislelabs-465) Shopping centres faced a 33–43 per cent drop in foot traffic in March compared to February. Mall operators around the world coped by increasing sanitation, installing thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancelling events.[[465]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-J6Y6Z-466)

Hundreds of millions of jobs were lost,[[466]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-aljazeera2004271718-467)[[467]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200506csmonitor-468) including more than 40 million jobs in the US.[[468]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200528WaPo-469) According to a report by [Yelp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yelp "Yelp"), about 60% of US businesses that closed will stay shut permanently.[[469]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-vLHxV-470) The [International Labour Organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Labour_Organization "International Labour Organization") (ILO) reported that the income generated in the first nine months of 2020 from work across the world dropped by 10.7%, or $3.5 trillion.[[470]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-rd8bm-471)

#### Supply shortages

Main article: [Shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortages_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic")

[![Image 53](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Ntuc_super_store%2C_Singapore_%2849505410793%29.jpg/250px-Ntuc_super_store%2C_Singapore_%2849505410793%29.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ntuc_super_store,_Singapore_(49505410793).jpg)

COVID-19 fears led to panic buying of essentials across the world, including toilet paper, instant noodles, bread, rice, vegetables, disinfectant, and rubbing alcohol (picture taken in February 2020).

Pandemic fears led to [panic buying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panic_buying "Panic buying"), emptying groceries of essentials such as food, toilet paper, and bottled water. Panic buying stemmed from perceived threat, perceived scarcity, fear of the unknown, coping behaviour and social psychological factors (e.g. [social influence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_influence "Social influence") and trust).[[471]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-cSvA4-472)

Supply [shortages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortage "Shortage") were due to disruption to factory and logistic operations; shortages were worsened by [supply chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain "Supply chain") disruptions from factory and port shutdowns, and labour shortages.[[472]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-XvcU9-473)

Shortages continued as managers underestimated the speed of economic recovery after the initial economic crash. The technology industry, in particular, warned of delays from underestimates of [semiconductor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semiconductor "Semiconductor") demand for vehicles and other products.[[473]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AutoDW-263-474)

According to WHO Secretary-General Tedros Ghebreyesus, demand for [personal protective equipment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_protective_equipment "Personal protective equipment") (PPE) rose one hundredfold, pushing prices up twentyfold.[[474]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AutoDW-275-475)[[475]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AutoDW-276-476) PPE stocks were exhausted everywhere.[[476]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Mycfo-477)[[477]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-478)[[478]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-479)

In September 2021, the [World Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank "World Bank") reported that food prices remained generally stable and the supply outlook remained positive. However, the poorest countries witnessed a sharp increase in food prices, reaching the highest level since the pandemic began.[[479]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-480)[[480]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-auto4-481) The Agricultural Commodity Price Index stabilised in the third quarter but remained 17% higher than in January 2021.[[481]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-482)[[480]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-auto4-481)

By contrast, petroleum products were in surplus at the beginning of the pandemic, as demand for gasoline and other products collapsed due to reduced commuting and other trips.[[482]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-BBC,_US_oil_prices,_21_April_2020-483) The [2021 global energy crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_global_energy_crisis "2021 global energy crisis") was driven by a global surge in demand as the world economy recovered. Energy demand was particularly strong in Asia.[[483]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-484)[[484]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-485)

The performing arts and [cultural heritage sectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_heritage_sector "Cultural heritage sector") were profoundly affected by the pandemic. Both organisations' and individuals' operations have been impacted globally. By March 2020, across the world and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had been indefinitely closed with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.[[485]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-v5Qlx-486) A 2021 [UNESCO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNESCO "UNESCO") report estimated ten million job losses worldwide in the culture and creative industries.[[486]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Ottone-487)[[487]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-488) Some services continued through digital platforms,[[488]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-ZljIY-489)[[489]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Burke2020-490)[[490]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-SxIEK-491) such as live streaming concerts[[491]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-SZ5Mc-492) or web-based arts festivals.[[492]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-mYlLn-493)

Intellectual opposition came primarily from other fields, along with heterodox epidemiologists.[[496]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-74OHE-497)

#### Brazil

The pandemic (and the [response of Brazilian politicians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Brazil#Responses "COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil") to it) led to widespread panic, confusion, and pessimism in Brazil.[[497]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-BenderdaSilvaBaum2022-498) When questioned regarding record deaths in the country in April 2020, Brazilian president [Jair Bolsonaro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jair_Bolsonaro "Jair Bolsonaro") said "So what? I'm sorry. What do you want me to do about it?"[[498]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Conde_2020-499) Bolsonaro disregarded WHO-recommended mitigation techniques and instead [downplayed the risks of the virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Brazil#Comments_by_Bolsonaro "COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil"), promoted increased economic activity, spread [misinformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Brazil#Presidential_responses "COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil") about the efficacy of masks, vaccines and public health measures, and distributed unproven treatments including [hydroxychloroquine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroquine_and_hydroxychloroquine_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine during the COVID-19 pandemic") and [ivermectin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivermectin_during_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Ivermectin during the COVID-19 pandemic").[[497]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-BenderdaSilvaBaum2022-498) A series of [federal health ministers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Ministers_of_Health_of_Brazil "List of Ministers of Health of Brazil") resigned or were dismissed after they refused to implement Bolsonaro's policies.[[499]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Londono2020-500)

Disagreements between federal and state governments led to a chaotic and delayed response to the rapid spread of the virus,[[500]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Dantas2020-501) exacerbated by preexisting social and economic disparities in the country.[[497]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-BenderdaSilvaBaum2022-498)[[501]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-CarnutMendesGuerra2020-502) Employment, investment and valuation of the [Brazilian real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brazilian_real "Brazilian real") plummeted to record lows.[[497]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-BenderdaSilvaBaum2022-498)[[502]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-ReutersBrazil2020-503) Brazil was also heavily affected by the Delta and Omicron variants.[[503]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AlcantaraNogueiraShuabTosta2022-504) At the height of the outbreak in the spring of 2021, 3,000+ Brazilians were dying per day.[[504]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-BBCBrazilMarch2021-505)[[505]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-NPRBrazilApril2021-506) Bolsonaro's loss to [Lula da Silva](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lula_da_Silva "Lula da Silva") in the [2022 presidential election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Brazilian_general_election "2022 Brazilian general election") is widely credited to the former's [mishandling of the pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidency_of_Jair_Bolsonaro#Response_to_COVID-19_pandemic "Presidency of Jair Bolsonaro").[[506]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-ChomskyPolychroniou2023-507)[[507]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-EconomistBolsonaroLoss2022-508)[[508]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Milhorance2022October-509)

Hospital visits fell.[[562]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-563) Visits for heart attack symptoms declined by 38% in the US and 40% in Spain.[[563]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-564) The head of cardiology at the [University of Arizona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Arizona "University of Arizona") said, "My worry is some of these people are dying at home because they're too scared to go to the hospital".[[564]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Stat_News,_with_serious_heart_symptoms_away,_April_23-565) People with strokes and [appendicitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appendicitis "Appendicitis") were less likely to seek treatment.[[565]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-566)[[566]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-567)[[564]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Stat_News,_with_serious_heart_symptoms_away,_April_23-565)[Medical supply shortages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortages_related_to_the_COVID-19_pandemic "Shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic") impacted many people.[[567]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Atlantic_Shortages-568) The pandemic impacted [mental health](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_health "Mental health"),[[568]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-569)[[569]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Stix_2021-570) increasing [anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anxiety "Anxiety"), depression, and [post-traumatic stress disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-traumatic_stress_disorder "Post-traumatic stress disorder"), affecting healthcare workers, patients and quarantined individuals.[[570]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-571)[[571]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Santomauro_2021-572)

In late 2022, during the first northern hemisphere autumn and winter seasons following the widespread relaxation of global public health measures, North America and Europe experienced a surge in respiratory viruses and coinfections in both adults and children.[[572]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-573) This formed the beginning of the 2022–2023 paediatric care crisis and what some experts termed a "[tripledemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripledemic "Tripledemic")" of seasonal influenza, [respiratory syncytial virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_syncytial_virus "Respiratory syncytial virus") (RSV), and SARS-CoV-2 throughout North America.[[573]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-574)[[574]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-575) In the United Kingdom, paediatric infections also began to spike beyond pre-pandemic levels, albeit with different illnesses, such as [Group A streptococcal infection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_A_streptococcal_infection "Group A streptococcal infection") and resultant [scarlet fever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scarlet_fever "Scarlet fever").[[575]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-576)[[576]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-United_Kingdom-577) As of mid-December 2022, 19 children in the UK had died due to [Strep A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pyogenes "Streptococcus pyogenes") and the wave of infections had begun to spread into North America and Mainland Europe.[[577]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Strep_A_death-578)[[578]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Strep_Expansion-579)

The B/Yamagata lineage of [influenza B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influenza_B "Influenza B") might have become extinct in 2020/2021 due to COVID-19 pandemic measures.[[579]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Alhoufie2021-580)[[580]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Koutsakos2021-581) There have been no naturally occurring cases confirmed since March 2020.[[581]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-WHOflu2023-582)[[582]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-UMN2023-583) In 2023, the WHO concluded that protection against the Yamagata lineage was no longer necessary in the seasonal [flu vaccine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flu_vaccine "Flu vaccine"), reducing the number of lineages targeted by the vaccine from four to three.[[581]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-WHOflu2023-582)[[582]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-UMN2023-583)

### Environment

Main article: [Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_the_environment "Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the environment")

[![Image 57](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Pollutant_Drops_in_wuhan_china_due_to_virus.png/500px-Pollutant_Drops_in_wuhan_china_due_to_virus.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Pollutant_Drops_in_wuhan_china_due_to_virus.png)

Images from the [NASA Earth Observatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_Earth_Observatory "NASA Earth Observatory") show a stark drop in pollution in [Wuhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan "Wuhan"), when comparing [NO 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_dioxide "Nitrogen dioxide") levels in early 2019 (top) and early 2020 (bottom).[[583]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-584)

The pandemic and the reaction to it positively affected the [environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_environment "Natural environment") and [climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate "Climate") as a result of reduced human activity. During the "[anthropause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropause "Anthropause")", fossil fuel use decreased, resource consumption declined, and waste disposal improved, generating less pollution.[[584]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-:9-585)[Planned air travel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic#Transportation "Economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic") and vehicle transportation declined. In China, [lockdowns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_lockdown_in_Hubei "COVID-19 lockdown in Hubei") and other measures resulted in a 26% decrease in coal consumption, and a 50% reduction in nitrogen oxides emissions.[[584]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-:9-585)[[585]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-586)[[586]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-587)

In 2020, a worldwide study on mammalian wildlife responses to human presence during COVID lockdowns found complex patterns of animal behaviour. Carnivores were generally less active when humans were around, while herbivores in developed areas were more active. Among other findings, this suggested that herbivores may view humans as a shield against predators, highlighting the importance of location and human presence history in understanding wildlife responses to changes in human activity in a given area.[[587]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-588)

A [wide variety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_animals_that_can_get_SARS-CoV-2 "List of animals that can get SARS-CoV-2") of largely mammalian species, both captive and wild, have been shown to be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, with some encountering a particularly high degree of fatal outcomes.[[588]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-589) In particular, both [farmed and wild mink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_in_mink "SARS-CoV-2 in mink") have developed highly symptomatic and severe COVID-19 infections, with a mortality rate as high as 35–55% according to one study.[[589]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Frontiers_Spread-590)[[590]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-591)[White-tailed deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_in_white-tailed_deer "SARS-CoV-2 in white-tailed deer"), on the other hand, have largely avoided severe outcomes but have effectively become [natural reservoirs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_reservoir "Natural reservoir") of the virus, with large numbers of free-ranging deer infected throughout the US and Canada, including approximately 80% of [Iowa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iowa "Iowa")'s wild deer herd.[[591]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-592)[[592]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Nature_April-593) An August 2023 study appeared to confirm the status of white-tailed deer as a disease reservoir, noting that the viral evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in deer occurs at triple the rate of its evolution in humans and that infection rates remained high, even in areas rarely frequented by humans.[[593]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Triple_Evolution-594)

### Discrimination and prejudice

A socially distanced homeless encampment in San Francisco, California, in May 2020[[594]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-595)

Heightened prejudice, [xenophobia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobia "Xenophobia"), and racism toward people of [Chinese and East Asian descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinophobe "Sinophobe") were documented around the world.[[595]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-AutoDW-251-596)[[596]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-zogcf-597) Reports from February 2020, when most confirmed cases were confined to China, cited racist sentiments about Chinese people 'deserving' the virus.[[597]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-bangkokpost1854094-598)[[598]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-psychologytoday202002-599)[[599]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200201telegraph-600) Individuals of Asian descent in Europe and North America reported increasing instances of racially motivated abuse and assaults as a result of the pandemic.[[600]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-NYT_Racism-601)[[601]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-05O7n-602)[[602]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-NYT_April_Racism-603) US president [Donald Trump](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") was criticised for referring to SARS-CoV-2 as the "Chinese Virus" and "Kung Flu", terms which were condemned as being racist and xenophobic.[[603]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-trumpnyt-604)[[604]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-20200320BI-605)[[605]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-MNCw4-606)

[Age-based discrimination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ageism "Ageism") against older adults increased during the pandemic. This was attributed to their perceived vulnerability and subsequent physical and social isolation measures, which, coupled with their reduced social activity, increased dependency on others. Similarly, limited digital literacy left the elderly more vulnerable to isolation, depression, and loneliness.[[606]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-607)

In a correspondence published in _[The Lancet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Lancet "The Lancet")_ in 2021, German epidemiologist Günter Kampf described the harmful effects of "inappropriate stigmatisation of unvaccinated people, who include our patients, colleagues, and other fellow citizens", noting the evidence that vaccinated individuals play a large role in transmission.[[607]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-608) American bioethicist Arthur Caplan responded to Kampf, writing "Criticising [the unvaccinated] who... wind up in hospitals and morgues in huge numbers, put stress on finite resources, and prolong the pandemic... is not stigmatising, it is deserved moral condemnation".[[608]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-609)

In January 2022, [Amnesty International](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International "Amnesty International") urged [Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic_in_Italy "COVID-19 pandemic in Italy") to change their anti-COVID-19 restrictions to avoid discrimination against unvaccinated people, saying that "the government must continue to ensure that the entire population can enjoy its fundamental rights". The restrictions included mandatory vaccination over the age of 50, and mandatory vaccination to use public transport.[[609]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-610)

### Lifestyle changes

[![Image 59](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Wee_Annie%2C_Kempock_Street%2C_face_mask.jpg/250px-Wee_Annie%2C_Kempock_Street%2C_face_mask.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wee_Annie,_Kempock_Street,_face_mask.jpg)

The "Wee Annie" statue in [Gourock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gourock,_Scotland "Gourock, Scotland"), Scotland, was given a face mask during the pandemic.

The pandemic triggered massive changes in behaviour, from increased Internet commerce to cultural changes in the workplace. Online retailers in the US posted $791.70 billion in sales in 2020, an increase of 32.4% from $598.02 billion the year before.[[610]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-DDCV1ECMR-611) Home delivery orders increased, while indoor restaurant dining shut down due to lockdown orders or low sales.[[611]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Fo18zrty783-612)[[612]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Fo18zrty784-613) Hackers, [cybercriminals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybercriminal "Cybercriminal") and scammers took advantage of the changes to launch new online attacks.[[613]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Fo18zrty787-614)

Education in some countries temporarily shifted from physical attendance to video conferencing.[[614]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Fo18zrty790-615) Massive layoffs shrank the airline, travel, hospitality, and other industries.[[615]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Fo18zrty6966-616)[[616]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Fo18zrty9999-617) Despite most corporations implementing measures to address COVID-19 in the workplace, a poll from [Catalyst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalyst_(nonprofit_organization) "Catalyst (nonprofit organization)") found that as many as 68% of employees around the world felt that these policies were only performative and "not genuine".[[617]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-618)

The pandemic led to a surge in [remote work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_work "Remote work"). According to a [Gallup poll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallup_poll "Gallup poll"), only 4% of US employees were fully remote before the pandemic, compared to 43% in May 2020. Among white collar workers, that shift was more pronounced, with 6% increasing to 65% in the same period.[[618]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-The_New_York_Times_2022-619) That trend continued in later stages of the pandemic, with many workers choosing to remain remote even after workplaces reopened.[[619]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Mitchell_2022-620)[[620]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Kagubare_2023-621) Many Nordic, European, and Asian companies increased their recruitment of international remote workers even as the pandemic waned, partially to save on labour costs.[[621]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-ComputerWeekly.com_2023-622)[[622]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Braesemann_Stephany_Teutloff_K%C3%A4ssi_2022_p=e0274630-623) This also led to a talent drain in the global south and in remote areas in the global north.[[622]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Braesemann_Stephany_Teutloff_K%C3%A4ssi_2022_p=e0274630-623)[[623]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-EuropeanStingWEF2023-624) High cost of living and dense urban areas also lost office real estate value due to remote worker exodus.[[624]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Economist2022Jan-625) By May 2023, due to increasing layoffs and concerns over productivity, some white collar workplaces in the US had resorted to performance review penalties and indirect incentives (e.g. donations to charity) to encourage workers to return to the office.[[625]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Peck_2023-626)

### Historiography

A 2021 study noted that the COVID-19 pandemic had increased interest in epidemics and infectious diseases among both historians and the general public. Prior to the pandemic, these topics were usually overlooked by "general" history and only received attention in the [history of medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_medicine "History of medicine").[[626]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-627) Many comparisons were made between the COVID-19 and [1918 influenza pandemics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_influenza_pandemic "1918 influenza pandemic"),[[627]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-628)[[628]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-629) including the development of anti-mask movements,[[629]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-630)[[630]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-631) the widespread promotion of misinformation[[631]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-632)[[632]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-633) and the impact of [socioeconomic disparities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_determinants_of_health "Social determinants of health").[[633]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-634)

### Religion

In some areas, religious groups exacerbated the spread of the virus, through large gatherings and the dissemination of misinformation.[[634]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-635)[[635]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-636)[[636]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-637) Some religious leaders decried what they saw as violations of religious freedom.[[637]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-638) In other cases, religious identity was a beneficial factor for health, increasing compliance with public health measures and protecting against the negative effects of isolation on mental wellbeing.[[638]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-639)[[639]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-640)[[640]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-641)

Some news organisations removed their online paywalls for some or all of their pandemic-related articles and posts.[[641]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-642) Many scientific publishers provided pandemic-related journal articles to the public free of charge as part of the National Institutes of Health's COVID-19 Public Health Emergency Initiative.[[642]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-643)[[643]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-644) According to one estimate from researchers at the University of Rome, 89.5% of COVID-19-related papers were open access, compared to an average of 48.8% for the ten most deadly human diseases.[[644]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-645) The share of papers published on preprint servers prior to peer review increased dramatically.[[645]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-646)

During the pandemic, [Web GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_GIS "Web GIS") technology was leveraged to provide up to date visualisations of data related to the pandemic with the public.[[646]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Juergens2020-647) Employing this technology, the [Johns Hopkins University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johns_Hopkins_University "Johns Hopkins University") COVID-19 [dashboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(computing) "Dashboard (computing)") served as the first global visualisation of COVID-19 data, which established it as the default method for government agencies to dissemeniate relevant spatial information.[[647]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Everts2020-648)[[648]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Adams2025-649) These dashboards were described by Jonathan Everts as "the most striking cultural artefact of the current coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic",[[647]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Everts2020-648) and during the pandemic every state government in the United States maintained one.[[649]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-Adams2023-650)

The COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on popular culture. It was included in the narratives of ongoing pre-pandemic television series and become a central narrative in new ones, with mixed results.[[653]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-654) Writing for _[The New York Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_New\_York\_Times "The New York Times")_ about the then-upcoming [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC") sitcom _[Pandemonium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here\_We\_Go\_(TV\_series)#Pilot "Here We Go (TV series)")_ on 16 December 2020, [David Segal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Segal_(journalist) "David Segal (journalist)") asked, "Are we ready to laugh about Covid-19? Or rather, is there anything amusing, or recognizable in a humorous way, about life during a plague, with all of its indignities and setbacks, not to mention its rituals and rules".[[654]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-655)

The pandemic had driven some people to seek peaceful [escapism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapism "Escapism") in media, while others were drawn towards fictional pandemics (e.g. [zombie apocalypses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_apocalypse "Zombie apocalypse")) as an alternate form of escapism.[[655]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-656) Common themes have included [contagion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contagious_disease "Contagious disease"), [isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolation_(health_care) "Isolation (health care)") and loss of [control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_(psychology) "Control (psychology)").[[656]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-657) Many drew comparisons to the fictional film _[Contagion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contagion\_(2011\_film) "Contagion (2011 film)")_ (2011),[[657]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-658)[[658]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-659) praising its accuracies while noting some differences,[[659]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-660) such as the lack of an orderly vaccine rollout.[[660]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-661)[[661]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-662)

As people turned to music to relieve emotions evoked by the pandemic, [Spotify](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify "Spotify") listenership showed that classical, [ambient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambient_music "Ambient music") and [children's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children%27s_music "Children's music") genres grew, while pop, [country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music "Country music") and dance remained relatively stable.[[662]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-663)

Transition to later phases
--------------------------

Main article: [Endemic COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_COVID-19 "Endemic COVID-19")

A March 2022 review declared a transition to endemic status to be "inevitable".[[663]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-664) In June 2022, an article in _[Human Genomics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human\_Genome\_Organisation "Human Genome Organisation")_ said that the pandemic was still "raging", but that "now is the time to explore the transition from the pandemic to the endemic phase".[[664]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-665) Another review that month predicted that the virus that causes COVID-19 would become the fifth endemic seasonal coronavirus, alongside four other [human coronaviruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCoV "HCoV").[[665]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-666)

A February 2023 review of the four [common cold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_cold "Common cold") coronaviruses concluded that the virus would become seasonal and, like the common cold, cause less severe disease for most people.[[666]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-667) Another 2023 review stated that the transition to endemic COVID-19 may take years or decades.[[667]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-668)

On 5 May 2023, the WHO declared that the pandemic was no longer a [public health emergency of international concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_health_emergency_of_international_concern "Public health emergency of international concern").[[668]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-669) This led several media outlets to incorrectly report that this meant the pandemic was "over". The WHO commented to [Full Fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Fact "Full Fact") that it was unlikely to declare the pandemic over "in the near future" and mentioned [cholera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cholera "Cholera"), which it considers to have been a [pandemic since 1961](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh_cholera_pandemic "Seventh cholera pandemic") (i.e., continuously for the last 64 years).[[669]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-ff-670) The WHO does not have an official category for pandemics or make declarations of when pandemics start or end.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-reuters-4)[[262]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-guardian-263)[[670]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-671)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-timemarch2024-13)

In June 2023, [Hans Kluge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Kluge "Hans Kluge"), director of the WHO in Europe, commented that "While the international public health emergency may have ended, the pandemic certainly has not". The WHO in Europe launched a transition plan to manage the public health response to COVID-19 in the coming years and prepare for possible future emergencies.[[671]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-kluge-672)

Epidemics and pandemics usually end when the disease becomes [endemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endemic_COVID-19 "Endemic COVID-19"), and when the disease becomes "an accepted, manageable part of normal life in a given society".[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-charters2021-15) As of March 2024, there was no widely agreed definition of when a disease is or is not a pandemic, though efforts at a formal definition were underway. Experts asked by _[Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time\_(magazine) "Time (magazine)")_ that month noted that COVID-19 continued to circulate and cause disease, but expressed uncertainty as to whether it should still be described as a pandemic.[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-timemarch2024-13)

Long-term effects
-----------------

### Economic

Despite strong economic rebounds following the initial lockdowns in early 2020, towards the latter phases of the pandemic, many countries began to experience long-term economic effects. Several countries saw high [inflation rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_rate "Inflation rate") which had global impacts, particularly in developing countries.[[672]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-673) Some economic impacts such as [supply chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain "Supply chain") and trade operations were seen as more permanent as the pandemic exposed major weaknesses in these systems.[[673]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-674)

In Australia, the pandemic caused an increase in [occupational burnout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_burnout "Occupational burnout") in 2022.[[674]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-675)

During the pandemic, a large percentage of workers in Canada came to prefer working from home, which had an impact on the traditional work model. Some corporations made efforts to force workers to return to work on-site, while some embraced the idea.[[675]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-676)

### Travel

There was a "travel boom" causing air travel to recover at rates faster than anticipated, and the aviation industry became profitable in 2023 for the first time since 2019, before the pandemic.[[676]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-677) However, economic issues meant some predicted that the boom would begin to slow down.[[677]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-678) Business travel on airlines was still below pre-pandemic levels and is predicted not to recover.[[678]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-679)

### Health

An increase in excess deaths from underlying causes not related to COVID-19 has been largely blamed on systematic issues causing delays in health care and screening during the pandemic, which has resulted in an increase of non-COVID-19 related deaths.[[679]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-680)

### Immunisations

During the pandemic, millions of children missed out on vaccinations as countries focused efforts on combating COVID-19. Efforts were made to increase vaccination rates among children in [low-income countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-income_countries "Low-income countries"). These efforts were successful in increasing vaccination rates for some diseases, though the UN noted that post-pandemic [measles vaccinations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measles_vaccination "Measles vaccination") were still falling behind.[[680]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-681)

Some of the decrease in immunisation was driven by an increase in mistrust of public health officials. This was seen in both low-income and high-income countries. Several [African countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_countries "African countries") saw a decline in vaccinations due to misinformation around the pandemic flowing into other areas.[[681]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-682) Immunisation rates have yet to recover in the United States[[682]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-683) and the United Kingdom.[[683]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic#cite_note-684)

The strategy aims to increase the capacity to identify and trace chains of transmission and to identify and manage outbreaks, while also integrating economic, psychological, social and healthcare support to guarantee the isolation of cases and contacts.

After evaluating the biology, pathogenesis, and emergence of the human coronaviruses that cause the common cold, we can anticipate that with increased vaccine immunity to SARS-CoV-2, it will become a seasonal, endemic coronavirus that causes less severe disease in most individuals. Much like the common cold CoVs, the potential for severe disease will likely be present in those who lack a protective immune response or are immunocompromised.
