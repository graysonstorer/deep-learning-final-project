Persecution of Muslims - Wikipedia

===============
Forced conversions of Muslims in Spain, 16th century, by [Edwin Long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Long "Edwin Long") (1829–1891)

The **persecution of Muslims** has been recorded throughout the [history of Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Islam "History of Islam"), beginning with its founding by [Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad "Muhammad") in the 7th century.

In the early days of [Islam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam "Islam") in [Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca "Mecca"), [pre-Islamic Arabia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Islamic_Arabia "Pre-Islamic Arabia"), the new [Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslims "Muslims") were frequently subjected to abuse and [persecution by the Meccans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims_by_Meccans "Persecution of Muslims by Meccans"), known as the [Mushrikun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushrikun "Mushrikun") in Islam, who were adherents to [polytheism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytheism "Polytheism"). In the contemporary period, Muslims have faced religious restrictions in some countries. Various incidents of Islamophobia have also occurred.

### Early Islam

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Persecution_of_Muslims&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Early Islam")]

Main article: [Persecution of Muslims by Meccans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims_by_Meccans "Persecution of Muslims by Meccans")

In the early days of Islam in [Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecca "Mecca"), the new Muslims were often subjected to abuse and persecution by the [pagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagan "Pagan") Meccans (often called _Mushrikin_: the unbelievers or [polytheists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytheist "Polytheist")). Some were killed, such as [Sumayya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumayya "Sumayya"), the seventh convert to Islam, who was allegedly tortured first by [Amr ibn Hisham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amr_ibn_Hisham "Amr ibn Hisham").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-1) Even the [Islamic prophet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_prophet "Islamic prophet")[Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_in_Islam "Muhammad in Islam") was subjected to such abuse; while he was praying near the [Kaaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba "Kaaba"), [Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uqba_ibn_Abu_Mu%27ayt "Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt") threw the [entrails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrail "Entrail") of a sacrificed camel over him. Abu Lahab's wife [Umm Jamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umm_Jamil "Umm Jamil") would regularly dump filth outside his door and placed thorns in the path to his house.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-2)[_[unreliable source?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable\_sources "Wikipedia:Reliable sources")_]

Accordingly, if free Muslims were attacked, slaves who converted were subjected to far worse. The master of the [Ethiopian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia "Ethiopia")[Bilal ibn Rabah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilal_ibn_Rabah "Bilal ibn Rabah") (who would become the first [muezzin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muezzin "Muezzin")) would take him out into the desert in the boiling heat of midday and place a heavy rock on his chest, demanding that he forswear his religion and pray to the polytheists' gods and goddesses, until [Abu Bakr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Bakr "Abu Bakr") bought him and freed him.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-3)

### Crusades

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Persecution_of_Muslims&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Crusades")]

Main article: [Crusades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades "Crusades")

The [First Crusade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Crusade "First Crusade") was launched in 1095 by [Pope Urban II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Urban_II "Pope Urban II"), with the stated goal of regaining control of the sacred city of [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem") and the [Holy Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Land "Holy Land") from the Muslims, who had captured them from the [Byzantines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire") in 638. The [Fatimid Caliph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatimid_Caliphate "Fatimid Caliphate"), [Al Hakim of Cairo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Hakim_bi-Amr_Allah "Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah"), known as the "mad Caliph"[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-4) destroyed the [Constantinian-era](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constantine_the_Great "Constantine the Great")[Church of the Holy Sepulcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_the_Holy_Sepulcher "Church of the Holy Sepulcher") in 1009, as well as [other Christian churches and shrines in the Holy Land](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatimid_desecration_of_Jerusalem "Fatimid desecration of Jerusalem").

This event, in conjunction with the [killing of Germanic pilgrims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_German_Pilgrimage_of_1064%E2%80%9365 "Great German Pilgrimage of 1064–65") who were travelling from Byzantium to Jerusalem, raised the anger of Europe, and inspired Pope Urban II to call on all Catholic rulers, [knights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight "Knight"), and noblemen to recapture the Holy Land from Muslim rule.

In part, it was also a response to the [Investiture Controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investiture_Controversy "Investiture Controversy"), which was the most significant [conflict between secular and religious](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_church_and_state_(medieval) "Separation of church and state (medieval)") powers in [medieval Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Europe "Medieval Europe"). The controversy began as a dispute between the [Holy Roman Emperor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Roman_Emperor "Holy Roman Emperor") and the [Gregorian Papacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_VII "Pope Gregory VII") and gave rise to the political concept of [Christendom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christendom "Christendom") as a union of all peoples and sovereigns under the direction of the pope; as both sides tried to marshal public opinion in their favour, people became personally engaged in a dramatic religious controversy. Also of great significance in launching the crusade were the string of victories by the Seljuk Turks, which saw the end of Arab rule in Jerusalem.

Capture of Jerusalem by the Crusaders in 1099

On 7 May 1099 the Crusaders reached [Jerusalem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem "Jerusalem"), which had been recaptured from the [Seljuks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seljuks "Seljuks") by the [Fatimids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatimid "Fatimid") of Egypt only a year before. On 15 July, the Crusaders were able to end the siege by breaking down sections of the walls and entering the city. Over the course of that afternoon, evening, and next morning, the Crusaders killed almost every inhabitant of Jerusalem, Muslims and Jews alike. Although many Muslims sought shelter atop the [Temple Mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_Mount "Temple Mount") inside the [Al-Aqsa Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qibli_Mosque "Qibli Mosque"), the Crusaders spared few lives. According to the anonymous _[Gesta Francorum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gesta\_Francorum "Gesta Francorum")_, in what some believe to be one of the most valuable contemporary sources of the First Crusade, "...the slaughter was so great that our men waded in blood up to their ankles...."[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-5) (which is however rather a literary figure used multiple times in similar context than probable reality). According to Fulcher of Chartres: "Indeed, if you had been there you would have seen our feet coloured to our ankles with the blood of the slain. But what more shall I relate? None of them were left alive; neither women nor children were spared.".[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-6)[Tancred, Prince of Galilee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tancred,_Prince_of_Galilee "Tancred, Prince of Galilee") claimed the [Temple quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temple_in_Jerusalem "Temple in Jerusalem") for himself and offered protection to some of the Muslims there, but he was unable to prevent their deaths at the hands of his fellow Crusaders.

During the massacre committed in Jerusalem during the First Crusade, it was reported that the Crusaders "[circled] the screaming, flame-tortured humanity singing 'Christ We Adore Thee!' with their Crusader crosses held high".[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-7) Muslims were indiscriminately killed, and Jews who had taken refuge in their synagogue were killed when it was burnt down by the Crusaders.

### Southern Italy

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Persecution_of_Muslims&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Southern Italy")]

Further information: [History of Islam in southern Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Islam_in_southern_Italy "History of Islam in southern Italy"), [Emirate of Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Sicily "Emirate of Sicily"), [Muslim settlement of Lucera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_settlement_of_Lucera "Muslim settlement of Lucera"), and [Muslim conquest of Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_conquest_of_Sicily "Muslim conquest of Sicily")

The island of [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily "Sicily") was conquered by the [Aghlabids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aghlabids "Aghlabids") in the 10th century after over a century of conflict, with the [Byzantine Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_Empire "Byzantine Empire") losing its final stronghold in 965.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-8) The [Normans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo-Norman "Italo-Norman") conquered the last Arab Muslim stronghold by 1091.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-9) Subsequently, just as Muslims had previously imposed the [jizya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jizya "Jizya") tax on the non-Muslims of Sicily, the new rulers continued the practice and imposed the same tax now on the Muslims (locally spelled _gisia_). Another tax on levied them for a time was the _augustale_.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-10) Muslim rebellion broke out during the reign of [Tancred](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tancred,_King_of_Sicily "Tancred, King of Sicily") as [King of Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_Sicily "King of Sicily"). Lombard pogroms against Muslims started in the 1160s. Muslim and Christian communities in Sicily became increasingly geographically separated. The island's Muslim communities were mainly isolated beyond an internal frontier which divided the south-western half of the island from the Christian north-east. Sicilian Muslims were dependent on royal protection. When [King William the Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_II_of_Sicily "William II of Sicily") died in 1189, this royal protection was lifted, and the door was opened for widespread attacks against the island's Muslims. Tolerance towards Muslims ended with increasing Hohenstaufen control. Many oppressive measures, passed by [Frederick II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor"), were introduced in order to please the Popes to stop Islam from being practised in [Christendom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christendom "Christendom"): the result was in a rebellion of Sicily's Muslims. This triggered organized and systematic reprisals which marked the final chapter of Islam in Sicily. The rebellion abated, but direct papal pressure induced Frederick to mass transfer all his Muslim subjects deep into the Italian hinterland.[[11]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-11)[[12]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-12)[[13]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-autogenerated2-13)[[14]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-14)[_[excessive citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources#Bundling\_citations "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_] In 1224, [Frederick II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor "Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor") expelled all Muslims from the island transferring many to Lucera (_Lugêrah_, as it was known in Arabic) over the next two decades. In this controlled environment they could not challenge royal authority and they benefited the crown in taxes and military service. Their numbers eventually reached between 15,000 and 20,000, leading Lucera to be called _Lucaera Saracenorum_ because it represented the last stronghold of Islamic presence in Italy. During peacetime, Muslims in Lucera were predominantly farmers. They grew [durum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durum "Durum") wheat, [barley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley "Barley"), [legumes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legume "Legume"), grapes, and other fruits. Muslims also kept bees for [honey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honey "Honey").[[15]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-15) The [Muslim settlement of Lucera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_settlement_of_Lucera "Muslim settlement of Lucera") was destroyed by [Charles II of Naples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_II_of_Naples "Charles II of Naples") with backing from the papacy. The Muslims were either massacred, forcibly converted, enslaved, or exiled. Their abandoned mosques were demolished, and churches were usually built in their place. The [Lucera Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucera_Cathedral "Lucera Cathedral") was built on the site of a mosque which was destroyed. The mosque was the last one still functioning in [medieval Italy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medieval_Italy "Medieval Italy") by that time.[[16]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-16)[[17]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-17)[[18]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-18)[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-19)[_[excessive citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources#Bundling\_citations "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_] Some were exiled, with many finding asylum in [Albania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albania "Albania") across the [Adriatic Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adriatic_Sea "Adriatic Sea").[[20]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-20)[[21]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-21) Islam was no longer a major presence in the island by the 14th century.

The Aghlabids also conquered the island of [Malta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta "Malta") at the same time during their invasion of Sicily.[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-22) Per the [Al-Himyari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitab_al-Rawd_al-Mitar "Kitab al-Rawd al-Mitar") the island was reduced to an uninhabited ruin due to the conquest. The place was later converted into a settlement by Muslims.[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-23) The Normans conquered it at the same time as Sicily.[[24]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-24) The Normans however did not interfere in the matters of Muslims of the island and gave them a tributary status.[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-25) Their conquest however led to the [Christianization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianization "Christianization") and [Latinization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latinization_(historical) "Latinization (historical)") of the island.[[26]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-26) An annual fine on the Christian community for killing of a Muslim was also repealed in the 12th century, signifying the degradation of the protection given to the Muslims.[[27]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-27) Most of the Maltese Muslims were deported by 1271.[[28]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-28) All Maltese Muslims had converted to Christianity by the end of the 15th century and had to find ways to disguise their previous identities by Latinizing or adopting new surnames.[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-29)

### Mongol invasions

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Persecution_of_Muslims&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Mongol invasions")]

Main article: [Mongol invasions and conquests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_and_conquests "Mongol invasions and conquests")

[Genghis Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan "Genghis Khan"), and the later [Yuan Emperors of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Yuan_emperors "List of Yuan emperors") imposed restrictive decrees which forbade Islamic practices like [halal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halal "Halal") butchering and forced Muslims to follow Mongol methods of butchering animals.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] As a result of these decrees, Muslims were forced to slaughter sheep in secret.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-30) Genghis Khan referred to Muslims as "slaves", and he also commanded them to follow the Mongol method of eating rather than the halal one.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_][Circumcision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circumcision "Circumcision") was also forbidden.[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-31)[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-32) Toward the end of [their rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_dynasty "Yuan dynasty"), the corruption of the Mongol court and the persecution of Muslims became so severe that Muslim generals joined [Han Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese "Han Chinese") in rebelling against the Mongols. The [Ming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty "Ming dynasty") founder Zhu Yuanzhang employed Muslim generals like [Lan Yu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lan_Yu_(general) "Lan Yu (general)") who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Some Muslim communities were named "kamsia", which, in [Hokkien](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hokkien "Hokkien") Chinese, means "thank you"; many Hui Muslims claim that their communities were named "kamsia" because the Han Chinese appreciated the important role which they had played in assisting them to overthrow the Mongols.[[33]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-33) The Muslims in the [Semu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semu "Semu") class also revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the [Ispah Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ispah_Rebellion "Ispah Rebellion") but the rebellion was crushed and the Muslims were massacred by the Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding.

Minaret of Baghdad's [al-Khulafa Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Khulafa_Mosque "Al-Khulafa Mosque") which was destroyed by the [Mongol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol "Mongol") ruler [Hulagu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulegu_Khan "Hulegu Khan") during the [1258 siege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Baghdad_(1258) "Battle of Baghdad (1258)")

Following the brutal [Mongol invasion of Central Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasion_of_Central_Asia "Mongol invasion of Central Asia") under [Genghis Khan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genghis_Khan "Genghis Khan"), and the [sack of Baghdad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Baghdad_(1258) "Battle of Baghdad (1258)") which occurred in 1258, the [Mongol Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_Empire "Mongol Empire")'s rule extended across most Muslim lands in [Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia "Asia"). The [Abbasid caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_caliphate "Abbasid caliphate") was destroyed and the [Islamic civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age "Islamic Golden Age") suffered much devastation, especially in [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia "Mesopotamia"), and [Tengriism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengriism "Tengriism") and Buddhism replaced it as the official religions of the empire.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Brown-34) However, the Mongols attacked people for goods and riches, not because of their religion. Later, many Mongol khans and rulers such as those of the [Oljeitu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oljeitu "Oljeitu"), the [Ilkhanid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilkhanid "Ilkhanid"), and the [Golden Horde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horde "Golden Horde") became Muslims along with their subjects. The Mongols made no real effort to replace Islam with any other religion, they just had the desire to plunder goods from anyone who did not submit to their rule, which was characteristic of Mongol warfare.[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] During the [Yuan Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuan_Dynasty "Yuan Dynasty") which the Mongols founded in China, Muslim scientists were highly regarded and Muslim beliefs were also [respected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_during_the_Yuan_dynasty "Islam during the Yuan dynasty"). Regarding the Mongol attacks, the Muslim historian, [ibn al-Athir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_ibn_al-Athir "Ali ibn al-Athir") lamented:

> I shrank from giving a recital of these events on the account of their magnitude and abhorrence. Even now I come reluctant to the task, for who would deem it a light thing to sing the death song of Islam and the Muslims or find it easy to tell this tale? O that my mother had not given me birth![[35]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-35)

The detailed atrocities during the sack of Baghdad include:[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_]

*   The [Grand Library of Baghdad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Wisdom "House of Wisdom"), which contained countless precious historical documents and books on subjects that ranged from [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine "Medicine") to [astronomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy"), was destroyed. Survivors said that the waters of the [Tigris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tigris "Tigris") ran black with ink from the enormous quantities of books that were flung into the river.
*   Citizens attempted to flee, but they were intercepted by Mongol soldiers who killed them with abandon. Martin Sicker writes that close to 90,000 people may have died (Sicker 2000, p.111).[_[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation\_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")_] Other estimates go much higher. [Wassaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wassaf "Wassaf") claims that the loss of life was several hundred thousand. Ian Frazier of _[The New Yorker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_New\_Yorker "The New Yorker")_ claims that estimates of the death toll range from 200,000 to one million.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-36)
*   The Mongols looted and destroyed mosques, palaces, libraries, and hospitals. Grand buildings which had taken generations to build were burned to the ground.
*   The [caliph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Musta%27sim "Al-Musta'sim") was captured and forced to watch as his citizens were murdered and his treasury was plundered. According to most accounts, the caliph was killed by trampling. The Mongols rolled the caliph up in a rug, and rode their horses over him, because they believed that the earth would be offended if it were ever touched by royal blood. All but one of his sons were killed, and the sole surviving son was sent to Mongolia.
*   [Hulagu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulagu_Khan "Hulagu Khan") had to move his camp upwind from the city, due to the stench of decay that emanated from its ruins.

At the intervention of Hulagu's [Nestorian Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestorianism "Nestorianism") wife, [Dokuz Khatun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dokuz_Khatun "Dokuz Khatun"), the city's Christian inhabitants were spared.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-37)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-38) Hulagu offered the royal palace to the Nestorian [Catholicos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicos "Catholicos")[Mar Makikha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_Makikha "Mar Makikha"), and he also ordered that a cathedral should be built for him.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-39) Ultimately, the seventh ruler of the Ilkhanate, [Mahmud Ghazan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Ghazan "Mahmud Ghazan"), converted from [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism "Buddhism") to Islam, and thus began the gradual decline of Tengrism and Buddhism in the region and its replacement by the renaissance of Islam. Later, three of the four principal Mongol khanates embraced Islam.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-40)

Muslim and Jewish paternal cousin marriage was banned by the Yuan dynasty which also forced Muslims to obey Mongol customs like levirate marriage.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-41)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-42)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-43)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-44)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-45)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-46)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-47)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-48)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-49)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-50)[_[excessive citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources#Bundling\_citations "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_]

Arabs relying largely on [Berbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_people "Berber people")[conquered the Iberian Peninsula starting in 711](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_conquest_of_Hispania "Umayyad conquest of Hispania"), subduing the whole [Visigothic Kingdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visigothic_Kingdom "Visigothic Kingdom") by 725. The triumphant [Umayyads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate "Umayyad Caliphate") got conditional capitulations probably in most of the towns, so that they could get a compromise with the native population. This was not always so. For example, Mérida, Cordova, Toledo, or Narbonne were conquered by storm or after laying siege on them. The arrangement reached with the locals was based on respecting the laws and traditions used in each place, so that the _Goths_ (a legal concept, not an ethnic one, i.e. the communities ruled by the _[Forum Iudicum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum\_Iudicum "Forum Iudicum")_) continued to be ruled on new conditions by their own tribunals and laws.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-51) The Gothic Church remained in place and collaborated with the new masters. [Al-Andalus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Andalus "Al-Andalus") or Muslim ruled Iberian peninsula, was conquered by northern Christian kingdoms in 1492, as a result of their expansion taking place especially after the definite collapse of the [Caliphate of Cordova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliphate_of_Cordova "Caliphate of Cordova") in 1031.

The coming of the Crusades (starting with the [massacre of Barbastro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_Barbastro "War of Barbastro")) and similarly entrenched positions on the northern African [Almoravids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almoravid_dynasty "Almoravid dynasty"), who took over al-Andalus as of 1086, added to the difficult coexistence between communities, including Muslims in Christian ruled territory, or the [Mozarabic rite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozarabic_rite "Mozarabic rite") Christians (quite different from those of the northern kingdoms), and further minority groups. The Almohads, a fanatic north African sect who later occupied al-Andalus, were the only Iberian Muslim rulers to demand conversion, exile, or death from the Christians and Jews.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-52)

[Expulsion of the Moriscos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_the_Moriscos "Expulsion of the Moriscos") from Valencia

During the expansion south of the northern Christian kingdoms, depending on the local capitulations, local Muslims were allowed to remain ([Mudéjars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud%C3%A9jar "Mudéjar")) with extreme restrictions, while some were peacefully converted to the Christian faith. After the [conquest of Granada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_Granada "Conquest of Granada"), all the Spanish Muslims were under Christian rule. The new acquired population spoke Arabic or [Mozarabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozarabic_language "Mozarabic language"), and the campaigns to convert them were unsuccessful. Legislation was gradually introduced to remove Islam, culminating with the Muslims being forced to convert to Catholicism by the [Spanish Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition "Spanish Inquisition"). They were known as [Moriscos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morisco "Morisco") and considered [New Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Christian "New Christian"). Further laws were introduced, as on 25 May 1566, stipulating that they "had to abandon the use of Arabic, change their costumes, that their doors must remain open every Friday, and other feast days, and that their baths, public and private, to be torn down."[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-53) The reason doors were to be left open so as to determine whether they secretly observed any Islamic festivals.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-54) King [Philip II of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain "Philip II of Spain") ordered the destruction of all public baths on the grounds of them being relics of infidelity, notorious for their use by Muslims performing their purification rites.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-55)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-56) The possession of books or papers in Arabic was near concrete proof of disobedience with severe reprisals and penalties.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-57) On 1 January 1568, Christian priests were ordered to take all Morisco children between the ages of three and fifteen, and place them in schools, where they were forced to learn Castillian and Christian doctrine.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-58) All these laws and measures required force to be implemented, and from much earlier.

Between 1609 and 1614 the Moriscos were expelled from Spain.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-59) They were to depart 'under the pain of death and confiscation, without trial or sentence ... to take with them no money, bullion, jewels, or bills of exchange ... just what they could carry.'[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-60)

All in all, it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of Muslims (as well as Jews and Protestants) were forcibly converted to Catholicism, expelled, or tortured to death during the Inquisition.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-61)

The ways the Muslims were persecuted included banning the repair of old mosques and preventing new ones from being constructed, banning [serfdom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serfdom "Serfdom") of Christians under Muslims, banning marriage of Christian females to Muslims, putting limitations on property ownership among Tatars and the [Polish–Ottoman Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish%E2%80%93Ottoman_Wars "Polish–Ottoman Wars") fed into the discriminatory atmosphere against them and led to anti-Islamic writings and attacks.[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Akiner2009-62)

[Misr Diwan Chand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misr_Diwan_Chand "Misr Diwan Chand") became the first Hindu governor of Kashmir under Singh and enacted dozens of anti-Muslim laws. He raised the tax levels of Muslim subjects, demolished the Jamia Masjid of [Srinagar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinagar "Srinagar") and prohibited cow slaughter. The punishment for cow slaughter was the death penalty without any exception.[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-63)[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-64)[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-65)[Shah Shuja Durrani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shah_Shuja_Durrani "Shah Shuja Durrani"), the grandson of [Ahmad Shah Durrani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Shah_Durrani "Ahmad Shah Durrani"), wanted to implement similar anti-cow slaughter policies in the [Emirate of Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emirate_of_Afghanistan "Emirate of Afghanistan") and with help from Singh and the [East India Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company "East India Company") regained the Afghan throne and imposed a ban on cow slaughter in Kabul.[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-66)

[Sayyid Ahmed Barelvi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syed_Ahmad_Barelvi "Syed Ahmad Barelvi") declared war against Maharaja Ranjit Singh and recruited many Muslims from madrassas. However the Yousufzai and Muhammadzai Khawaneen did not like his egalitarian ideals and betrayed Sayyid Ahmed Shahid and his army at the battle of Balakot and supported the Sikh Army in the Battle of Balakote in 1831, and Barelvi's head was severed by the Sikh General [Hari Singh Nalwa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Singh_Nalwa "Hari Singh Nalwa").[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-67)[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-68)

Raja Sultan Khan of [Bhimber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhimber "Bhimber") also met the same fate when he was defeated and captured by the Dogra ruler Gulab Singh and brought to [Jammu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jammu "Jammu") where he was imprisoned.

Half a million Muslims succeeded in reaching Ottoman controlled lands and 672,215 of them were reported to have remained after the war. Approximately a quarter of a million of them perished as a result of massacres, cold, disease, and other harsh conditions.[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-78) According to Aubaret, the French Consul in [Ruse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruse,_Bulgaria "Ruse, Bulgaria") in 1876, in the [Danube Vilayet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danube_Vilayet "Danube Vilayet") which also included Northern Dobruja in today's Romania, as well as a substantial portion of territory in today's southern Serbia, there were 1,120,000 Muslims and 1,233,500 non-Muslims of whom 1,150,000 were Bulgarian. Between 1876 and 1878, through massacres, epidemics, hunger, and war, a large portion of the Turkish population vanished.[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-79) In [1950-1951 around 155,000 left Bulgaria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exodus_of_Turks_from_Bulgaria_(1950-1951) "Exodus of Turks from Bulgaria (1950-1951)") as a result of Islamophobia and Anti-Turkish sentiment.

The Dungan revolt erupted due to infighting between Muslim Sufi sects, the Khafiya and the Jahariyya, and the [Gedimu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gedimu "Gedimu"). When the rebellion failed, mass-immigration of the [Dungan people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungan_people "Dungan people") into [Imperial Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire"), [Kazakhstan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhstan "Kazakhstan"), and [Kyrgyzstan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyrgyzstan "Kyrgyzstan") ensued. Before the war, the population of Shaanxi province totalled approximately 13 million inhabitants, at least 1,750,000 of whom were Dungan (Hui). After the war, the population dropped to 7 million; at least 150,000 fled. But once-flourishing Chinese Muslim communities fell 93% in the revolt in Shaanxi province. Between 1648 and 1878, around twelve million [Hui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hui_people "Hui people") and Han Chinese were killed in ten unsuccessful uprisings.[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-82)[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-83)

The [invasion by Jahangir Khoja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C4%80f%C4%81q%C4%AB_Khoja_Holy_War "Āfāqī Khoja Holy War") was preceded by another Manchu official, Binjing who raped a Muslim daughter of the Kokan aqsaqal from 1818 to 1820. The Qing sought to cover up the rape of Uyghur women by Manchus to prevent anger against their rule from spreading among the Uyghurs.[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-88)

The Manchu official Shuxing'a started an anti-Muslim massacre which led to the [Panthay Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panthay_Rebellion "Panthay Rebellion").

He refused to accept the surrender of New Teaching Muslims who still believed in its tenets, since the Qing classified them as a dangerous heterodox cult, similar to the [White Lotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Lotus_Societies "White Lotus Societies") Buddhists.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-102)

The Qing authorities decreed that the Hui rebels who had taken part in violent attacks were merely heretics and not representative of the entire Hui population, just as the heretical White Lotus did not represent all Buddhists.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-103) Qing authorities decreed that there were two different Muslim sects, the "old" religion and "new" religion. The new were heretics and deviated from Islam in the same way that the White Lotus deviated from Buddhism and Daoism, and stated its intention to inform the Hui community that it was aware that the original Islamic religion was one united sect before the advent of new "heretics", saying they would separate Muslim rebels by which sect they belonged to.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-104) Zuo also stated that he would accept the surrender of New Teaching Muslims who admitted that they were deceived, radicalized, and misled by its doctrines. Zuo excluded khalifas and mullas from the surrender.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-105)

During the [Cultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution "Cultural Revolution"), mosques along with other religious buildings were often defaced, destroyed, or closed and copies of the [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran "Quran") were destroyed and cemeteries by the [Red Guards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Guards_(China) "Red Guards (China)").[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-106) During that time, the government also constantly accused Muslims and other religious groups of holding "superstitious beliefs" and promoting "[anti-socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-socialist "Anti-socialist") trends".[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-107) The government began to relax its policies toward Muslims in 1978, and supported worship and rituals. Today, Islam is experiencing a modest revival and there are now[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-108)[many mosques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mosques_in_China "List of mosques in China") in China. There has been an upsurge in Islamic expression and many nationwide Islamic associations have been organized to co-ordinate inter-ethnic activities among Muslims.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-109)

However, restrictions have been imposed on Uyghur Islamic practices because the Chinese government has attempted to link Islamic beliefs with terrorist activities since 2001. Numerous events have led the Chinese government to crack down on most displays of Islamic piety among Uyghurs, including the wearing of veils and long beards. The [Ghulja Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghulja_Incident "Ghulja Incident") and the [July 2009 Ürümqi riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2009_%C3%9Cr%C3%BCmqi_riots "July 2009 Ürümqi riots") were both caused by abusive treatment of Uyghur Muslims within Chinese society, and they resulted in even more extreme government crackdowns. While Hui Muslims are seen as being relatively docile, Uyghurs are stereotyped as [Islamists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism "Islamism") and punished more severely for crimes than Hui are. In 1989, China's government banned a book which was titled _Xing Fengsu_ ("Sexual Customs") and placed its authors under arrest after Uyghurs and Hui Muslims protested against its publication in Lanzhou and Beijing because it insulted Islam.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Beijing_Review,_Volume_32_1989-110)[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Gladney_1991-111)[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Schein_2000-112)[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Gladney_2004-113)[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Bulag_2010-114)[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Gladney_2005-115)[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Gladney_2013-116)[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Sautman_2000-117)[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Gladney_1996-118)[_[excessive citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources#Bundling\_citations "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_] Hui Muslims who vandalized property during the protests against the book's publication were not punished but Uyghur protestors were imprisoned.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-books.google.com-119)

The [Libyan genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_genocide_(1929%E2%80%931934) "Libyan genocide (1929–1934)") was the systematic destruction of the indigenous Libyan [Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs "Arabs") people and culture in [Italian Libya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_colonization_of_Libya "Italian colonization of Libya") by the [Italian colonial authorities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_Empire "Italian Empire") from 1911 to 1943, using the wider definition of [genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genocide "Genocide"), where an estimated 250,000-750,000 Libyans died as a result of colonial-related causes.[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-:6-120)[[121]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-121) The most severe and frequent episodes of Italian atrocities against the locals came during the conflict between Italy and the indigenous rebels of the [Senussi Order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senussi "Senussi") that lasted from 1923 until 1932, when the principal Senussi leader, [Omar Mukhtar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_Mukhtar "Omar Mukhtar"), was captured and executed. Italy committed major [war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_crime "War crime") during the conflict; including the use of [chemical weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_weapon "Chemical weapon"), episodes of refusing to take prisoners of war and instead executing surrendering combatants, and mass executions of civilians.[[122]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-122)[[123]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-123)[[124]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-124) During this period, an estimated 83,000-125,000 Libyans were massacred or died in Italian concentration camps.[[125]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-125)[[120]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-:6-120)

Some governments and scholars have called the [French conquest of Algeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_conquest_of_Algeria "French conquest of Algeria") a genocide. [Ben Kiernan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Kiernan "Ben Kiernan"), an Australian expert on the [Cambodian genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian_genocide "Cambodian genocide"), wrote in _[Blood and Soil: A World History of Genocide and Extermination from Sparta to Darfur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood\_and\_Soil\_(book) "Blood and Soil (book)")_ on the French conquest of Algeria:[[126]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-126)

> By 1875, the French conquest was complete. The war had killed approximately 825,000 indigenous Algerians since 1830. A long shadow of genocidal hatred persisted, provoking a French author to protest in 1882 that in Algeria, "we hear it repeated every day that we must expel the native and if necessary destroy him." As a French statistical journal urged five years later, "the system of extermination must give way to a policy of penetration."

During the French conquest from 1830 to 1875, the native Algerian population fell by up to one-third due to war, massacres, famine and disease. Between 500,000 and 1,000,000 Algerians, out of a total of 3 million, were killed.[[127]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-127)[[128]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-128)[[129]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Kiernan2007-129) Atrocities committed by the French during this period include wholesale massacres of civilians, [scorched earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_earth "Scorched earth") tactics, destroying mosques and converting them to Catholic churches, burying people alive, and French horse units throwing boiling water on Algerians perceived to be resisting in any

massacre"), where 3,000 to 45,000 Algerian civilians were massacred by French troops and [Pied-Noir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pied-Noir "Pied-Noir") vigilante mobs), rape, torture by electric shock, burning and beating, burial alive, [death flights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_flights "Death flights"), sexual assaults, and the use of napalm to indiscriminately burn villages and

pattern of French colonial rule which has been described as "quasi-[apartheid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid "Apartheid")".[[155]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-155)[Napoleon III](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_III "Napoleon III") oversaw an 1865 decree that allowed Arab and [Berber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berber_people "Berber people") Algerians to request French citizenship – but only if they "renounced their Muslim religion and culture":[[156]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-156) by 1913, only 1,557 Muslims had been granted French citizenship.[[157]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-157) Despite periodic attempts at partial reform, the situation of the _[Code de l'indigénat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code\_de\_l%27indig%C3%A9nat "Code de l'indigénat")_ persisted until the [French Fourth Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Fourth_Republic "French Fourth Republic"), which began in 1946, but although Muslim Algerians were accorded the rights of citizenship, the system of discrimination was maintained in more informal ways.[[158]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-158) This "internal system of apartheid" met with considerable resistance from the Muslims affected by it, and is cited as one of the causes of the [1954 insurrection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algerian_War "Algerian War").[[159]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Wall-159)

In response to France's recognition of [Armenian genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armenian_genocide "Armenian genocide"), Turkey accused France of committing genocide against 15% of Algeria's population.[[160]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-160)[[161]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-161) In October 2021, the office of Algerian president [Abdelmadjid Tebboune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdelmadjid_Tebboune "Abdelmadjid Tebboune") stated that 5.6 million Algerians had died during the country’s 132 years under French colonial rule, while historian Mohammed Al-Amin estimated that the total Algerian death toll could be as high as 10 million.[[162]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-162)[[163]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-163)[[164]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-164)

Generally speaking, French colonialism in Morocco was highly discriminatory against indigenous Moroccans and was detrimental to the Moroccan economy. Native Moroccans were treated as second class citizens and discriminated against in nearly all aspects of life. Additionally, land in Morocco was far more expensive for Moroccans than for French settlers.[[169]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-169) Various historians have estimated that around 100,000 Moroccans were killed during the [French conquest of Morocco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_conquest_of_Morocco "French conquest of Morocco") between 1907 and 1934. Around 8,000 French soldiers and 12,000 native Moroccans soldiers in the French army were also killed.[[170]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-:8-170)[[171]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-171) Historian Daniel Rivet adds that the tally would be significantly higher if including the enormous suffering of the Riffian tribes during the [Rif War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rif_War "Rif War") between 1921 and 1926.[[170]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-:8-170)

During the [Second Sino-Japanese war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Sino-Japanese_war "Second Sino-Japanese war") the Japanese followed what has been referred to as a "killing policy" and destroyed many mosques. According to Wan Lei, "Statistics showed that the Japanese destroyed 220 mosques and killed countless Hui people by April 1941." After the [Rape of Nanking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_of_Nanking "Rape of Nanking") mosques in Nanjing were found to be filled with dead bodies. They also followed a policy of economic oppression which involved the destruction of mosques and Hui communities and made many Hui jobless and homeless. Another policy was one of deliberate humiliation. This included soldiers smearing mosques with pork fat, forcing Hui to butcher pigs to feed the soldiers, and forcing girls to supposedly train as geishas and singers but in fact made them serve as sex slaves. Hui cemeteries were destroyed for military reasons.[[187]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-187) Many Hui [fought in the war against Japan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Muslims_in_the_Second_Sino-Japanese_war "Chinese Muslims in the Second Sino-Japanese war").

[Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myanmar "Myanmar") has a [Buddhist majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism_in_Myanmar "Buddhism in Myanmar"). The [Muslim minority in Myanmar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Myanmar "Islam in Myanmar") mostly consists of the [Rohingya people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_people "Rohingya people") and the descendants of Muslim immigrants from [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India "India") (including the modern-day nations of [Bangladesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh "Bangladesh")) and [China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China "China") (the ancestors of [Chinese Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_China "Islam in China") in Myanmar came from [Yunnan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yunnan "Yunnan") province), as well as the descendants of earlier [Arab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs "Arabs") and [Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_people "Persian people") settlers.

At first, the Buddhist persecution of Muslims arose for religious reasons, and it occurred during the reign of King [Bayinnaung](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayinnaung "Bayinnaung"), 1550–1589 AD. He also disallowed the [Eid al-Adha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Adha "Eid al-Adha"), the religious sacrifice of cattle, regarding the killing of animals in the name of religion as a cruel custom.

The [Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippines "Philippines") is a [predominantly Christian society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_the_Philippines "Christianity in the Philippines") with a complicated history of relations between Islam and Christianity. Despite historic evidence of [Islamization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_the_Philippines "Islam in the Philippines") spreading throughout the islands in the 13th–16th centuries, the archipelago [came under Spanish rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Philippines_(1521%E2%80%931898) "History of the Philippines (1521–1898)") in the 16th century. The Spanish proselytized many natives, and labelled those who remained Muslims as _Moro_, a derogatory term recalling the [Moors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moors "Moors"), an Islamic people of [North Africa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa "North Africa") who occupied parts of Spain for several centuries. Today, this term _Moro_ is used to refer to the indigenous Muslim tribes and ethnic groups of the country. When the Spanish came to the Philippine islands, most of the natives in Luzon and Visayas were pagans with Muslim minorities, and while Spanish proselytized many natives, many Muslims in Luzon and Visayas were not exempted by the Spaniards from the [Spanish Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanish_Inquisition "Spanish Inquisition"), wherein Muslims to become Catholics or else die for their faith. Those who remained Muslims are only the natives of [Mindanao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindanao "Mindanao") and [Sulu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulu "Sulu") which the Spaniards failed to subjugate, or had control of only briefly and partially.

The Moros fought in the [Moro Rebellion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moro_Rebellion "Moro Rebellion") against the Americans during which Americans massacred Moro women and children at the [Moro Crater massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moro_Crater_massacre "Moro Crater massacre"), [against the Japanese in World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moros_during_World_War_II "Moros during World War II"), and are [waging an insurgency against the Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moro_insurgency_in_the_Philippines "Moro insurgency in the Philippines").

The pro-Philippine government [Ilaga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilaga "Ilaga") militia, composed of Catholic and other Christian settlers on Moro land in Mindanao, were known for their atrocities and massacres against Moro civilians. The Ilaga's bloodiest attack happened in June 1971 when they slaughtered 65 Moro civilians in a Mosque during the [Manili massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manili_massacre "Manili massacre"). On 24 September 1974, in the [Malisbong massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malisbong_massacre "Malisbong massacre"), the [Armed Forces of the Philippines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armed_Forces_of_the_Philippines "Armed Forces of the Philippines") slaughtered about 1,500 Moro Muslim civilians who were praying in a Mosque, in addition to [mass raping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wartime_sexual_violence#Philippines:_Mindanao_and_Sulu "Wartime sexual violence") Moro girls who had been taken aboard a boat.[[234]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-234)

The period from the [conquest of Kazan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Kazan_Wars "Russo-Kazan Wars") in 1552 to the ascension of [Catherine the Great](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_the_Great "Catherine the Great") in 1762, was marked by systematic repression of Muslims through policies of exclusion and discrimination as well as the destruction of Muslim culture by elimination of outward manifestations of Islam such as mosques. The first wave of persecution and forced conversions of Muslims to Christianity occurred soon after the Russian conquest of the [Kazan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khanate_of_Kazan "Khanate of Kazan") and [Astrakhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrakhan_Khanate "Astrakhan Khanate") Khanates.[[241]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-:03-241)

Another period of intense mosque destruction and anti-Muslim oppression from the Russian authorities occurred during the 18th century. During the reign of [Anna of Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_of_Russia "Anna of Russia"), many Muslims were forced or pressured to convert.[[242]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-:13-242) New converts were exempted from paying taxes, were granted certain privileges, and were given better resources for the learning of their new faith. Many continued to secretly practice Islam and were [crypto-Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto-Islam "Crypto-Islam").[[242]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-:13-242)

The Russians initially demonstrated a willingness in allowing Islam to flourish as Muslim clerics were invited into the various region to preach to the Muslims, particularly the [Kazakhs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakhs "Kazakhs") whom the Russians viewed as "savages" and "ignorant" of morals and ethics.[[243]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-243)[[244]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-EncycSex572-244) However, Russian policy shifted toward weakening Islam by introducing pre-Islamic elements of collective consciousness.[[245]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Hunter14-245) Such attempts included methods of eulogizing pre-Islamic historical figures and imposing a sense of inferiority by sending Kazakhs to highly elite Russian military institutions.[[245]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Hunter14-245) In response, Kazakh religious leaders attempted to bring religious fervor by espousing [pan-Turkism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan-Turkism "Pan-Turkism"), though many were persecuted as a result.[[246]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-246)

While total expulsion as in other Christian nations such as Spain, Portugal, and Sicily was not feasible to achieve a homogeneous [Russian Orthodox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church "Russian Orthodox Church") population, other policies such as land grants and the promotion of migration by other Russian and non-Muslim populations into Muslim lands displaced many Muslims making them minorities in places such as some parts of the South Ural region to other parts such as the [Ottoman Turkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"), and almost annihilating the [Circassians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassians "Circassians"), [Crimean Tatars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Tatars "Crimean Tatars"), and various Muslims of the Caucasus. The Russian army rounded up people, driving Muslims from their villages to ports on the Black Sea, where they awaited ships provided by the neighbouring [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire"). The explicit Russian goal was to expel the groups in question from their lands.[[247]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-247) They were given a choice as to where to be resettled: in the Ottoman Empire or in Russia far from their old lands. Only a small percentage (the numbers are unknown) accepted resettlement within the [Russian Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Empire "Russian Empire"). The trend of [Russification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russification "Russification") has continued at different paces during the remaining Tsarist period and under the Soviet Union, so that today there are more Tatars living outside the [Republic of Tatarstan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatarstan "Tatarstan") than inside it.[[248]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-248)

Alexander Suvorov announced the capture of Ismail in 1791 to the Tsarina Catherine in a doggerel couplet, after the assault had been pressed from house to house, room to room, and nearly every Muslim man, woman, and child in the city had been killed in three days of uncontrolled massacre, 40,000 [Turks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turkish_people "Turkish people") dead, a few hundred taken into captivity. For all his bluffness, Suvorov later told an English traveller that when the massacre was over he went back to his tent and wept.[[249]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-J._Goodwin,_p._244-249)

During the [Circassian genocide](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circassian_genocide "Circassian genocide"), general [Grigory Zass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Zass "Grigory Zass") in sent the severed Circassian heads to Berlin for anatomical studies.[[250]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-250) The [Decembrist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decembrist "Decembrist")[Nikolai Ivanovich Lorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nikolai_Ivanovich_Lorer&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nikolai Ivanovich Lorer (page does not exist)")[[ru](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9B%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%80,_%D0%9D%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B9_%D0%98%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87 "ru:Лорер, Николай Иванович")] said that Zass cleaned and boiled the flesh off the heads after storing them under his bed in his tent. He also had Circassian heads outside of his tent impaled on lances on a hill. Circassian men's corpses were decapitated by Russian-Cossack women on the battlefield after the battles were over for the heads to be sent to Zass for collection.[[251]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-251)[[252]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-252)[[253]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-253)[[254]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-254)[_[excessive citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources#Bundling\_citations "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_] Zass erected Circassian heads on poles outside of his tent and witnesses saw the wind blowing the beards of the heads.[[255]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-255) Russian soldiers and Cossacks were paid for sending Circassian heads to General Zass.[[256]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-256)[[257]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-257)[[258]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-258)[[259]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-259)[_[excessive citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources#Bundling\_citations "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_] Besides cutting Circassian heads off and collecting them, Zass employed a deliberate strategy of annihilating Circassian en masse, burning entire Circassian villages with the people in it and encouraging violation of Circassian women and children.[[260]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-260)[[261]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-261) Zass' forces referred to all Circassian elderly, children women, and men as "Bandits, "plunderers", or "thieves" and the Russian empire's forces were commanded by ferociously partholofical officers who commanded political dissidents and criminals.[[262]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-262)[[263]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-263)[[264]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-264)[[265]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-265)[[266]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-266)[[267]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-267)[[268]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-268)[[269]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-269)[[270]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-270)[[271]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-271)[[272]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-272)[[273]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-273)[[274]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-274)[[275]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-275)[[276]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-276)[[277]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-277)[_[excessive citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources#Bundling\_citations "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_] Cossacks raped Circassian women and impregnated them with children.[[278]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Routledge-278) Circassian children were scared of Zass and he was called the devil (Iblis) by the Circassians.

The Soviet Union was hostile to all forms of religion, which was "[the opium of the masses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_of_the_people "Opium of the people")" in accordance with [Marxist ideology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism "Marxism"). Relative religious freedom existed for Muslims in the years following the revolution, but in the late 1920s the Soviet government took a strong anti-religious turn. Many mosques were closed or torn down.[[293]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-293) During the period of [Joseph Stalin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin")'s leadership, [Crimean Tatar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimean_Tatars "Crimean Tatars"), [Chechen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechen_people "Chechen people"), [Ingush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingush_people "Ingush people"), [Balkar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkars "Balkars"), [Karachay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karachays "Karachays"), and [Meskhetian Turk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meskhetian_Turks "Meskhetian Turks") Muslims were victims of mass deportation.

More than 32,000 [NKVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NKVD "NKVD") troops participated in this action. 193,865 Crimean Tatars were deported, 151,136 of them to [Uzbek SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uzbek_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic"), 8,597 to [Mari ASSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mari_Autonomous_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Mari Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic"), 4,286 to [Kazakh SSR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazakh_Soviet_Socialist_Republic "Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic"), the rest 29,846 to the various [oblasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblast "Oblast") of the [Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Soviet_Federative_Socialist_Republic "Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic").

As the [Ottoman Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire "Ottoman Empire") entered a permanent phase of decline in the late 17th century it was engaged in a protracted state of conflict, losing territories both in [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe "Europe") and the [Caucasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus "Caucasus"). The victors were the Christian states, the old [Habsburg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habsburg "Habsburg") and [Romanov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanov "Romanov") Empires, and the new nation-states of Greece, Serbia, Romania, and Bulgaria.[[297]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-297) Rival European powers encouraged the development of nationalist ideologies among the Ottoman subjects in which the Muslims were portrayed as an ethnic "fifth column" left over from a previous era that could not be integrated into the planned future states. The struggle to rid themselves of Ottomans became an important element of the self-identification of the Christians of the [Balkans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkans "Balkans").[[298]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-298)

According to Mark Levene, the Victorian public in the 1870s paid much more attention to the massacres and expulsions of Christians than to massacres and expulsions of Muslims, even if on a greater scale. He further suggests that such massacres were even favoured by some circles. Mark Levene also argues that the dominant powers, by supporting "nation-statism" at the [Congress of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Berlin "Congress of Berlin"), legitimized "the primary instrument of Balkan nation-building": [ethnic cleansing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnic_cleansing "Ethnic cleansing").[[299]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-299) Hall points out that atrocities were committed by all sides during the Balkan conflicts.

Similar events as these occurred elsewhere during the Greek Revolution resulting in the eradication and expulsion of virtually the entire Turkish population of the [Morea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morea "Morea"). These acts ensured the ethnic homogenization of the area under the rule of the future modern Greek state.[[319]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-319) According to claims by Turkish delegations, in 1878 the Muslim inhabitants in [Thessaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaly "Thessaly") are estimated to be 150,000 and in 1897 the Muslims numbered 50,000 in Crete.

Crampton describes an exodus of 130,000–150,000 expelled of which approximately half returned for an intermediary period encouraged by the [Congress of Berlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congress_of_Berlin "Congress of Berlin"). Hupchick and McCarthy point out that 260,000 perished and 500,000 became refugees.[[323]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-323)[[324]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-324) The Turkish scholars Karpat and Ipek argue that up to 300,000 were killed and 1–1.5 million were forced to emigrate.[[325]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-325)[[326]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-326) Members of the European press who covered the war in Bulgaria reported on the Russian atrocities against Muslims. Witness accounts from Schumla and Razgrad describe children, women, and elderly wounded by sabres and lances. They stated that the entire Muslim population of many villages had been massacred.[[327]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-327) Recently uncovered photographs in the archive of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the Russo-Turkish War 1877–1878 show the massacre of Muslims by the Russians in the region of [Stara Zagora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stara_Zagora "Stara Zagora") claiming to have affected some 20,000 Muslim civilians.[[328]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-328)

Massacres against Turks and Muslims during the [Balkan Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Wars "Balkan Wars") in the hands of Bulgarians, Greeks, and Armenians are described in detail in the 1912 Carnegie Endowment report.[[329]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-329) The Bulgarian violence during the [Balkan War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_War "Balkan War") included burning of villages, transforming mosques into churches, rape of women, and mutilation of bodies. It is estimated that 220,000 [Pomaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomaks "Pomaks") were forcefully [Christianized](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianized "Christianized") and forbidden to wear Islamic religious clothing.[[330]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-330)

During [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II "World War II"), the [Chetniks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chetniks "Chetniks"), a Yugoslav Royalist and Serbian nationalist movement, committed numerous [war crimes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chetnik_war_crimes_in_World_War_II "Chetnik war crimes in World War II") primarily directed against the non-Serb population of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia explicitly ordering the ethnic cleansing, mainly 29,000–33,000 Muslims were killed.[[331]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-331)[[332]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-332)

Also during World War II, Muslims faced sporadic but significant and violent persecution at the hands of the Croatian fascist [Ustaše](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usta%C5%A1e "Ustaše") movement in the [Independent State of Croatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_State_of_Croatia "Independent State of Croatia"). Despite Ustaše overtures and positive propaganda towards Muslims, the government in Zagreb in reality staunchly favored Catholics in the military, government and ministry positions, with Muslim militias being regarded as little more than cannon fodder with little to no combat effectiveness. Catholics held the vast majority of high ranking government offices, leading to complaints and protests from Muslim religious leaders. The archbishop of Sarajevo had stated that the situation had become critical for Muslims due to violent persecution from both the Serbian Chetniks and Croatian fascists. According to some reports, as many as 100,000 Muslims had been killed and 250,000 displaced by the Ustaše by 1943. There were also reports of forced conversions of Muslims to Catholicism. One German officer reportedly remarked that “the Muslims bear the special status of being persecuted by all others.”[[333]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-333)

The Republic of Turkey was founded on a strict interpretation of secularism by the war-hero turned statesman, [Mustafa Kemal Atatürk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustafa_Kemal_Atat%C3%BCrk "Mustafa Kemal Atatürk"). In the early republican era, the revolutionary Kemalist government had sought to actively de-Islamize society and turn Turkey into a fully Westernized country. The Kemalists had perceived religion, Islam in particular, to be a force of backwardness. As such, they cracked down on many outward expressions of Islam, whether orthodox or heterodox-folk manifestations of it. They wanted religion to be solely limited to the "conscience of individuals".[[349]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-:5-349) The fifth Turkish prime minister, [Şükrü Saracoğlu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%9E%C3%BCkr%C3%BC_Saraco%C4%9Flu "Şükrü Saracoğlu"), had allegedly desired the abolition of religion altogether through government restrictions.[[350]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-350) The government had all shariah courts (including those relating to personal civil law) and traditional madrasas dissolved. The teaching of Arabic, and the Arabic adhaan, was also banned.[[349]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-:5-349) The fez (an Ottoman Islamic head gear) was also banned, with European hats being mandated instead. Those who opposed this mandate were dealt with harshly.[[351]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-351) However, the military regime under [Kenan Evren](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenan_Evren "Kenan Evren") had softened its stance on Islam, seeing it as an alternative to communism.[[352]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-352) The Turkish generals had also promoted Turkish-Sunni Islam to counter Islamism, amidst the Iranian Revolution.[[353]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-353)

Riots broke out between Muslims and Tibetans over incidents such as bones in soups and prices of balloons, and Tibetans accused Muslims of being cannibals who cooked humans in their soup and of contaminating food with urine. Tibetans attacked Muslim restaurants. Fires set by Tibetans which burned the apartments and shops of Muslims resulted in Muslim families being killed and wounded in the 2008 mid-March riots. Due to Tibetan violence against Muslims, the traditional Islamic white caps have not been worn by many Muslims. Scarfs were removed and replaced with hairnets by Muslim women in order to hide.

On 8 October 2012, a mob of about 200 [Tibetan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people "Tibetan people") monks beat a dozen Dungans (Hui Muslims) in [Luqu County](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luqu_County "Luqu County"), [Gansu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gansu "Gansu") province, in retaliation for the Chinese Muslim community's application to build a mosque in the county.[[389]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Ethnic_Clashes_Over_Gansu_Mosque-389)

The main Mosque in Lhasa was burned down by Tibetans and Chinese Hui Muslims were violently assaulted by Tibetan rioters in the [2008 Tibetan unrest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_Tibetan_unrest "2008 Tibetan unrest").[[390]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-390) Tibetan exiles and foreign scholars like ignore and do not talk about sectarian violence between Tibetan Buddhists and Muslims.[[385]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Fischer-385) The majority of Tibetans viewed the wars against Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11 positively and it had the effect of galvanizing anti-Muslim attitudes among Tibetans and resulted in an anti-Muslim boycott against Muslim owned businesses.[[385]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Fischer-385): 17  Tibetan Buddhists propagate a false libel that Muslims cremate their Imams and use the ashes to convert Tibetans to Islam by making Tibetans inhale the ashes, even though the Tibetans seem to be aware that Muslims practice burial and not cremation since they frequently clash against proposed Muslim cemeteries in their area.[[385]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Fischer-385): 19

Since the Chinese government supports and backs up the Hui Muslims, the Tibetans deliberately attack the Hui Muslims as a way to demonstrate anti-government sentiment and because they have a background of sectarian violence against each other since Ma Bufang's rule due to their separate religions and ethnicity and Tibetans resent Hui economic domination.[[391]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-391)

Children under the age of 18 are not allowed to attend religious services at mosques.[[397]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-397) According to [Radio Free Asia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_Free_Asia "Radio Free Asia") in April 2017, the CCP banned Islamic names such as "Saddam", "Hajj", and "Medina" for babies born in Xinjiang.[[398]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-398) Since 2017, it is alleged that China has destroyed or damaged 16,000 [mosques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mosques_in_China "List of mosques in China") in China's Xinjiang province – 65% of the region's total.[[399]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-399)[[400]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-400)

According to human rights organizations and western media [Uyghurs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghurs "Uyghurs") face discrimination and religious persecution at the hands of the [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China "Government of the People's Republic of China") authorities. In a 2013 news article, _The New York Times_ reported, "Many Uighurs are also convinced that Beijing is seeking to wipe out their language and culture through assimilation and education policies that favor Mandarin over Uighur in schools and government jobs. Civil servants can be fired for joining Friday afternoon prayer services, and Uighur college students say they are often required to eat lunch in school cafeterias during the holy month of Ramadan, when observant Muslims fast."[[401]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-401) Chinese authorities have confiscated passports from all residents in largely [Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_China "Islam in China") region of [Xinjiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinjiang "Xinjiang"), populated by Turkic-speaking Uyghurs.[[402]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-402)

These so-called ["re-education" camps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-education_through_labor "Re-education through labor") and later, "vocational training centres", were described by the government for "rehabilitation and redemption" to combat terrorism and religious extremism.[[405]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-405)[[406]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-406) In response to the UN panel's finding of indefinite detention without due process, the Chinese government delegation officially conceded that it was engaging in widespread "resettlement and re-education" and State media described the controls in Xinjiang as "intense".[[407]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-407)

On 31 August 2018, the United Nations committee called on the Chinese government to "end the practice of detention without lawful charge, trial, and conviction", to release the detained persons, to provide specifics as to the number of interred individuals and the reasons for their detention, and to investigate the allegations of "racial, ethnic, and ethno-religious profiling". A [BBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC "BBC") report quoted an unnamed Chinese official as saying that "Uighurs enjoyed full rights" but also admitting that "those deceived by religious extremism... shall be assisted by resettlement and re-education".[[408]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-408) On 10 September 2018, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights [Michelle Bachelet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Bachelet "Michelle Bachelet") urged China to allow observers into Xinjiang and expressed concern about the situation there.

##### Persecution by the LTTE

[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Persecution_of_Muslims&action=edit&section=49 "Edit section: Persecution by the LTTE")]

Beginning in July 1990, tensions between the [Sri Lankan Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_Moors "Sri Lankan Moors") (who constitute a separate ethnic group) and the [Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberation_Tigers_of_Tamil_Eelam "Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam") arose. Tit-for-tat killings between Tamils and Muslims in the [Eastern Province](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Province,_Sri_Lanka "Eastern Province, Sri Lanka") resulted in the massacres of dozens of Muslims there. This culminated in the infamous [Kattankudy mosque massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kattankudy_mosque_massacre "Kattankudy mosque massacre") in August 1990 by the LTTE.[[456]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-hrw_1991-456) Following these massacres, thousands of Muslims fled Tamil-majority areas of the Eastern Province and resettled in Muslim-majority areas.[[457]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-icg_muslims-457)

Main article: [Islam in Tajikistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Tajikistan "Islam in Tajikistan")

See also: [Religion in Tajikistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Tajikistan "Religion in Tajikistan")

Sunni Islam of the [Hanafi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanafi "Hanafi") school has been officially recognized by the government since 2009.[[458]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-458) Tajikistan considers itself a [secular state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secular_state "Secular state") with a Constitution providing for freedom of religion. The Government has declared two Islamic holidays, [Id Al-Fitr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_ul-Fitr "Eid ul-Fitr") and [Idi Qurbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_al-Adha "Eid al-Adha"), as State holidays. According to a [U.S. State Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._State_Department "U.S. State Department") release and Pew research group, the population of Tajikistan is 98% [Muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim "Muslim"). The 2012 Pew report stated that approximately 87 of identified as [Sunni](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunni_Islam "Sunni Islam"), roughly 3% as [Shia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shia "Shia") and roughly 7% as [non-denominational Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-denominational_Muslims "Non-denominational Muslims").[[459]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-459)[[460]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-460) The remaining 2% of the population are followers of [Russian Orthodoxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church "Russian Orthodox Church"), a variety of Protestant denominations, Catholicism, [Zoroastrianism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism "Zoroastrianism"), and Buddhism.

A great majority of Muslims fast during Ramadan, although only about one third in the countryside and 10% in the cities observe daily prayer and dietary restrictions.

There is some reported concern among mainstream Muslim leaders that minority religious groups undermine national unity.[[461]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-461) There is a concern for religious institutions becoming active in the political sphere. The [Islamic Renaissance Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Renaissance_Party_of_Tajikistan "Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan") (IRP), a major combatant in the [1992–1997 Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tajikistan_Civil_War "Tajikistan Civil War") and then-proponent of the creation of an [Islamic state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_religion#Islamic_states "State religion") in Tajikistan, constitutes no more than 30% of the government by statute. Numbers of large mosques appropriate for Friday prayers are limited and some[_[who?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual\_of\_Style/Words\_to\_watch#Unsupported\_attributions "Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Words to watch")_] feel this is discriminatory.

By law, religious communities must register by the State Committee on Religious Affairs (SCRA) and with local authorities. Registration with the SCRA requires a charter, a list of 10 or more members, and evidence of local government approval prayer site location. Religious groups who do not have a physical structure are not allowed to gather publicly for prayer. Failure to register can result in large fines and closure of place of worship. There are reports that registration on the local level is sometimes difficult to obtain.[[462]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-462) People under the age of 18 are also barred from public religious practice.[[463]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-463)

The reason for having Tajikistan in this article is primarily because the government of the country itself, is – or is seen to be – the source of claimed persecution of Muslims. (As opposed to coming from outside forces or other religious groups.) This can make the reported issues open to bias by media and personal religious beliefs or preferences. In fact, the government – with the apparent approval of the people – is attempting to keep the government completely secular (full separation of Church and State) to avoid what they perceive as problems in other surrounding countries.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)

*   The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)
*   There are some restrictions, and the Government monitors the activities of religious institutions to keep them from becoming overtly political.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)
*   Religious communities must be registered by the Committee on Religious Affairs, which monitors the activities of Muslim groups[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)
*   The official reason given to justify registration is to ensure that religious groups act in accordance with the law but in practice it ensures they do not become overly political.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)
*   President Imomali Rahmonov strongly defended "secularism", likely understood both by the President and his audience, as being "antireligious" rather than "nonreligious."[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)
*   The vast majority of citizens, including members of the Government, consider themselves Muslims and are not anti-Islamic but there is a pervasive fear of Islamic fundamentalism in both the government and much of the population at large.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)
*   A 1998 law prohibits the creation of political parties with a religious orientation.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)
*   A November 2015 rule reportedly bans Government Employees from attending Friday Prayers.[[465]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-465)[[466]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-eurasianet1-466)
*   The Friday "Government Employee Prayer ban" appears to relate to leaving work during normal working hours to attend prayers. "Over the last two weeks, after Idi Qurbon, our management forbade us from leaving work to attend Friday prayers," one unnamed government employee told Asia-Plus.[[466]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-eurasianet1-466)

Mosques are not permitted to allow women inside due to a fatwa issued in August 2004, by the Tajik Council of Ulema, or scholars – the country's highest Muslim body.[[467]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-467) Part of the reasoning for this is that Tajikistan has 3,980 mosques, but very few are designed to allow men and women to worship separately, a practice Islam generally requires. The fatwa was not strictly enforced and more recently, it has been reported that the Ulema Council will relax the ban.[[468]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-468)

Only state controlled religious education is approved for children and long beards are banned in Tajikistan.[[469]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-469)

In Tajikistan, Mosques are banned from allowing Friday Prayers for children younger than 18 year old.[[470]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-470)[[471]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-471)[[472]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-472)[[473]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-473)[[474]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-474)

From the beginning of 2011, 1,500 mosques were shut down by the Tajik government, in addition to banning the hijab for children, banning the use of loudspeakers for the call of prayer, forbidding mosques from allowing women to enter, and monitoring Imams and students learning an Islamic education abroad, having sermons in the Mosque approved by the government and limiting the Mosque sermons to 15 minutes.[[475]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-475) Muslims experienced the most negative effects from the "Religion Law" enacted by the government of Tajikistan, curtailing sermons by Imams during weddings, making the "Cathedral mosques" the only legal place for sermons to be given by Imams with sermons not being allowed in five-fold mosques, the five-fold mosques are small mosques and serve a limited number of people while the medium and big mosques are categorized as Cathedral mosques, girls who wore the hijab have been expelled from schools and hijabs and beards are not permitted on passport photos.[[476]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-476) Mosques have been demolished and shut down by the Tajikistan government on the justification that they were not registered and therefore not considered as mosques by the government.[[477]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-477)[[478]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-478)

Tajikistan has targeted religious groups like Jehovah's Witnesses, Jews, Christians, and Muslims who try to evade control by the government, synagogue, churches, and Mosques have been shut down and destroyed, only a certain amount of mosques are allowed to operate and the state must approve all "religious activity", in which younger than 18-year-old children are not allowed to join in.[[479]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-479) Buildings for religious worship for Jehovah's Witnesses, Protestant Churches, the Jewish Synagogue, and Muslim mosques have been targeted, destroyed, and shut down and prayers are forbidden to take place in public halls, with severed restrictions placed on religion.[[480]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-480) Churches, a synagogue, and mosques have been destroyed by the Tajikistan government.[[481]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-481)

Government approval is required for Tajiks seeking to engage in religious studies in foreign countries and religious activities of Muslims in particular are subjected to controls by the Tajikistan government.[[482]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-482) State control has been implemented on Islamic madrasahs, Imams, and Mosques by Tajikistan.[[483]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-483) A list of sermon "topics" for Imams has been created by the Tajikistan government.[[484]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-484) Towns are only allowed to have a certain number of mosques and only religious buildings sanctioned by the government are allowed to host religious activities, schools have banned hijab, religious studies in private have been forbidden mosque religious services are not allowed to admit children and non-registered mosques have been closed.[[485]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-House2014-485)[[486]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-486)[[487]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-487) Religious matters are banned for children under 18 year old. Public buildings do not allow beards, schools ban hijabs, unregistered mosques are shut down, and sermons are subjected to government authority.[[488]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-488) Only if "provided the child expresses a desire to learn" can a family teach religion to their own children, while the Tajik government banned all non-family private education.[[489]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Lenz-Raymann2014-489) Islam and Muslims have been subjected to controls by the Tajikistan government, the states decides what sermons the Imams give, the government discharges the salaries of Imams and there is only a single madrasah in Tajikistan.[[490]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-490)

Jehovah's Witnesses have been declared illegal in Tajikistan.[[491]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-491) Abundant Life Christian Centre, Ehyo Protestant Church, and Jehovah's witnesses have accused Tajikistan of lying about them not being declared illegal at a Warsaw OSCE conference for human rights.[[492]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-492)

Among increasingly religious Tajiks, Islamic-Arabic names have become more popular over Tajik names.[[493]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-493) However the government has considered the outlawing of Arabic-Islamic names for children.[[494]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-494)[[495]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-495)[[496]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-496)[[497]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-497)[[498]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-498)[[499]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-499)[_[excessive citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\_sources#Bundling\_citations "Wikipedia:Citing sources")_] Tajikistan President Rakhmon (Rahmon) has said that the Persian epic Shahnameh should be used as a source for names, with his proposed law hinting that Muslim names would be forbidden after his anti-hijab and anti-beard laws.[[500]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-auto1-500)

The Tajik government has used the word "prostitute" to label hijab wearing women and enforced shaving of beards.[[500]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-auto1-500) As well as that the black coloured Islamic veil was attacked and criticized in public by Tajik President [Emomali Rahmon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emomali_Rahmon "Emomali Rahmon").[[211]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-auto-211)

In Uzbekistan and Tajikistan women wore veils which covered their entire face and body like the [Paranja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paranja "Paranja") and faranji. The traditional veil in Central Asia worn before modern times was the faranji but it was banned by the Soviet Communists[[511]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-AbdullaevAkbarzaheh2010-511) but the Tajikistan President Emomali has misleadingly tried to claim that veils were not part of Tajik culture.[[211]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-auto-211)

The [Cham Muslims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chams "Chams") in Vietnam are only recognized as a minority, and not as an indigenous people by the Vietnamese government despite being indigenous to the region. Muslim Chams have experienced violent religious and ethnic persecution and restrictions on practising their faith under the current Vietnamese government, with the Vietnamese state confisticating Cham property and forbidding Cham from observing their religious beliefs. In 2010 and 2013 several incidents occurred in Thành Tín and Phươc Nhơn villages where Cham were murdered by Vietnamese. In 2012, Vietnamese police in Chau Giang village stormed into a Cham Mosque, stole the electric generator, and also raped Cham girls.[[513]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-513) Cham Muslims in the Mekong Delta have also been economically marginalized and pushed into poverty by Vietnamese policies, with ethnic [Vietnamese Kinh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_people "Vietnamese people") settling on majority Cham land with state support, and religious practices of minorities have been targeted for elimination by the Vietnamese government.[[514]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-514)

In 1989, 310,000 Turks left Bulgaria, many of them left under pressure as a result of the communist dictator [Todor Zhivkov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todor_Zhivkov "Todor Zhivkov") regime's assimilation campaign (though up to a third of them returned before the end of the year). That program, which began in 1984, forced all Turks and all other Muslims who lived in Bulgaria to adopt [Bulgarian names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgarian_name "Bulgarian name") and renounce all Muslim customs. The motivation behind the 1984 assimilation campaign is unclear; however, some experts believe that the disproportionately high birth rate of the Turks and the lower birth rate of the Bulgarians were major factors.[[538]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-autogenerated1-538) During the name-changing phase of the campaign, Turkish towns and villages were surrounded by army units. Citizens were issued new identity cards with Bulgarian names. Failure to present a new card meant forfeiture of salary, pension payments, and bank withdrawals. Birth or marriage certificates would only be issued in Bulgarian names. Traditional Turkish costumes were banned; homes were searched and all signs of Turkish identity were removed. Mosques were closed. According to contemporary estimates, 500 to 1,500 people were killed when they resisted assimilation measures, and thousands of others were imprisoned, sent to labour camps or forcibly resettled.[[539]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-539)

In 2015, the city of [Toronto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toronto "Toronto") reported a similar trend: hate crimes in general decreased by 8.2%, but hate crimes against Muslims had increased.[[611]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-TorontoSpike-612) Police hypothesized the spike could be due to the [Paris attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks "November 2015 Paris attacks") or anger over refugees. Muslims faced the third highest level of hate crimes in Toronto, after Jews and the LGBTQ community.[[611]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-TorontoSpike-612)

In 2017, a Tennessee man harassed two Muslim girls after they got off a school bus. He yelled at the girls "Go back to your country!". The man injured the father of the girls by assaulting him and swinging a knife. The man also chased the mother while still holding the knife. When he was taken into custody, he called the family "terrorists" and vowed to kill them when released from jail. Acting U.S. Attorney Mary Jane Stewart said of the attack, "The cowardly and unprovoked attack and display of hate-filled aggression by this defendant toward two innocent young girls and their father is despicable. An attack upon the free exercise of any person's religious beliefs is an attack on that person's civil rights.

In the aftermath of the [September 11 attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks "September 11 attacks"), Arabs and Muslims complained of increased scrutiny and racial profiling at airports. In a poll conducted by the _[Boston Globe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston\_Globe "Boston Globe")_, 71 percent of Blacks and 57 percent of Whites believed that "Arabs and Arab-Americans should undergo special, more intensive security checks before boarding airplanes." Some Muslims and Arabs have complained of being held without explanation and subjected to hours of questioning and arrest without cause. Such cases have led to lawsuits being filed by the ACLU. Fox News radio host [Mike Gallagher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Gallagher_(political_commentator) "Mike Gallagher (political commentator)") suggested that airports have a "Muslims Only" line in the wake of the 9/11 attacks stating "It's time to have a Muslims check-point line in America's airports and have Muslims be scrutinized. You better believe it, it's time." In Queens, New York, Muslims and Arabs have complained that the NYPD is unfairly targeting Muslim communities in raids tied to the alleged Zazi terror plot.

The war on terror has been labelled a war against Islam by ex-[United States Attorney General](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Attorney_General "United States Attorney General")[Ramsey Clark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey_Clark "Ramsey Clark"), who said that "Most of the politicians are putting it as Islamic terrorists but what they really mean is the threat of Islam. So the idea of the war on Islam is the idea of extermination of a proportion never seen in history at any time."[[633]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-634)

There is no widely agreed on figure for the number of people that have been killed so far in the War on Terror as it has been defined by the Bush Administration to include the [war in Afghanistan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%932021) "War in Afghanistan (2001–2021)"), the [war in Iraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War "Iraq War"), and operations elsewhere.

Estimates of the number of those dead from disease and starvation and as a direct result of warfare during the early years of colonization vary considerably, but the most reliable ones indicate that the native population of Algeria fell by nearly one-third in the years between the French invasion and the end of fighting in the mid-1870s.

But fears of India becoming a Hindu authoritarian state have been voiced after Narendra Modi of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came to power in New Delhi in 2014. The party's Hindutva philosophy—the creation of a great Hindu state—envisages a Hindu state where citizens with other religious beliefs are tolerated but have second-class status. The BJP has been associated with hundreds of violent Hindu-Muslim riots over the decades, the latest beingin Delhi in February 2020, which claimed 54 lives.
