**_In the exercise_** of the powers vested in the High Representative by Article V of Annex 10 (Agreement on Civilian Implementation of the Peace Settlement) to the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina, according to which the High Representative is the final authority in theatre regarding interpretation of the said Agreement on the Civilian Implementation of the Peace Settlement; and considering in particular Article II.1. (d) of the last said Agreement, according to the terms of which the High Representative shall “[F]acilitate, as the High Representative judges necessary, the resolution of any difficulties arising in connection with civilian implementation”; **_Recalling_**paragraph XI.2 of the Conclusions of the Peace Implementation Conference held in Bonn on 9 and 10 December 1997, in which the Peace Implementation Council welcomed the High Representative’s intention to use his final authority in theatre regarding interpretation of the Agreement on the Civilian Implementation of the Peace Settlement in order to facilitate the resolution of any difficulties as aforesaid “by making binding decisions, as he judges necessary” on certain issues including, under sub-paragraph (c) thereof, “measures to ensure implementation of the Peace Agreement throughout Bosnia and Herzegovina and its Entities”; **_Noting_** that the Judgment of the International Court of Justice, dated 26 February 2007 in the Case Concerning the Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina _v. Serbia and Montenegro) determined that genocide was committed in Srebrenica;_ **_Noting_**that under Article VII of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina it was recognised “that the observance of human rights and the protection of refugees and displaced persons are of vital importance in achieving a lasting peace”, and that under Article II: 1 of Annex 4 of the last said Agreement, Bosnia and Herzegovina and both Entities are required to “ensure the highest level of internationally recognised human rights and fundamental freedoms”; **_Recalling_** the High Representative’s Decision of 25 October 2000 designating in perpetuity the piece of land situated at Potocari in the municipality of Srebrenica as a cemetery and as a solemn place for the erection of a memorial to those who met their deaths in July 1995 at Potocari/Srebrenica; **_Recalling and confirming_**all the matters set out in the preamble of the said Decision and bearing in mind that the High Representative’s said Decision was intended to be the first in a series of Decisions regulating the arrangements necessary to establish the cemetery and memorial; **_Noting_** that, under the said Decision of 25 October 2000, the High Representative was to establish under the applicable local law such foundation or association as might be appropriate in order to administer and provide initial funding for the cemetery and memorial; **_Bearing in mind_** that the Foundation “Srebrenica–Potocari”, Memorial and Cemetery was established by the Decision of the High Representative, no. 102/01 of 10 May 2001 and registered in the Register of Foundations of Public Interests by the decision of the Ministry of Civil Affairs and Communications of Bosnia and Herzegovina no. 01/6 –166-1-MP/02 of 11 December 2002; **_Ever conscious_** of the importance of establishing a cemetery and memorial as a means of bringing reconciliation to the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which reconciliation will in turn promote the return of displaced persons and refugees and permanent peace; **_Respecting_** the fact that the recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of each and every human being is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world; **_Out of respect further_** for the solemn duty which falls upon the living to ensure the dignity and proper burial of the dead, and respecting the rights of the families of the deceased to bury their dead in accordance with their religious beliefs, a right which flows from Article 9 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; **_Acknowledging_** with deep regret that a large number of victims killed at Srebrenica/Potocari remains to be recovered and exhumed from places still unknown; **_Acknowledging further_**that it belongs to Bosnia and Herzegovina to ensure that a final resting place and a site for a memorial for those who perished in the aforesaid genocide is found and properly managed; **_Conscious further_** of the necessity of a constant reminder that genocide should never be repeated to any people again in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Having considered, noted and borne in mind all the matters aforesaid, I hereby issue the following: **Decision** **Enacting the Law on the Center for the Srebrenica-Potocari Memorial and Cemetery for the Victims of the 1995 Genocide** The Law which follows and which forms an integral part of this Decision shall enter into force as provided for in Article 29 thereof on an interim basis, until such time as the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina adopts this Law in due form, without amendment and with no conditions attached.
