Fact Sheet

February 10, 2016

* * *

**More information about Tajikistan is available on the**[**Tajikistan Page**](https://2009-2017.state.gov/p/sca/ci/ti/)**and from other Department of State publications and other sources listed at the end of this fact sheet.**

**U.S.-TAJIKISTAN RELATIONS**

The United States established diplomatic relations with Tajikistan in 1992, following its independence from the Soviet Union. The United States and Tajikistan have a broad-based relationship, cooperating in such areas as counter-narcotics, counterterrorism, non-proliferation, and regional growth and stability. In 2010, the United States and Tajikistan launched an annual bilateral consultation process to enhance cooperation. Tajikistan has been a strong partner to the United States and international forces in efforts to bring security and peace to Afghanistan, playing an important role in supply and transit routes.

Stability and economic growth in Tajikistan are critical to achieving overall regional stability and to strengthening regional economic integration. Tajikistan faces many challenges, including a long border with Afghanistan that is difficult to manage, widespread corruption, inadequate health and education systems, and food and energy shortages. Regional threats include extremism, radicalization, terrorism, and drugs.

**U.S. Assistance to Tajikistan**

U.S. Government assistance to Tajikistan seeks to help defense and law enforcement agencies counter transnational threats, improve local governance and transparency, increase food security and public health services, and reform the education system, particularly focusing on creating opportunities for youth to contribute to society. A fact sheet on U.S. assistance to Tajikistan can be found [**here**](https://2009-2017.state.gov/p/eur/ace/c11609.htm).

**Bilateral Economic Relations**

Tajikistan is one of the world’s poorest countries, and it depends on remittances and commodity exports that make it vulnerable to global economic conditions. Tajikistan has signed a trade and investment framework agreement with the United States and other Central Asian countries establishing a regional forum to discuss ways to improve investment climates and expand trade within Central Asia.

**Tajikistan's Membership in International Organizations**

Tajikistan and the United States belong to a number of the same international organizations, including the United Nations, Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, World Trade Organization, International Monetary Fund, and World Bank. Tajikistan is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Partnership for Peace.

**Bilateral Representation**

The U.S. Ambassador to Tajikistan is [Elisabeth Millard](https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/biog/252390.htm); other principal embassy officials are listed in the Department's [**Key Officers List.**](https://2009-2017.state.gov/documents/organization/111812.pdf)

Tajikistan maintains an [**embassy**](http://www.tjus.org/) in the United States at 1005 New Hampshire Ave NW, Washington, DC 20037 (tel.: 202-223-6090).
