It claimed that 588 tonnes of wheat and 150 tonnes of rice had been distributed in the relief camps till Tuesday. Vajpayee would later attend the meeting of the all-party relief committee headed by Governor S S Bhandari to review the steps being taken for the rehabilitation of the victims of the recent violence. Political observers feel that the visit could have a 'salutary effect' in calming the surcharged atmosphere in the state. Police sources said the prime minister would also make a brief visit to Godhra accompanied by Chief Minister Narendra Modi. He will be accompanied by Union Minister of Textiles Kashiram Rana and Union Minister of State for Heavy Chemicals Dr Vallabh Kathiria from Delhi, they said. Before returning to Delhi, Vajpayee is to hold a press conference at the Sardar Patel International Airport at about 1715 hrs. Meanwhile, the fresh spate of violence in the Kutch region, which has a significant minority community population, on the eve of the prime minister's visit has shaken the state administration. _PTI_ [**The Sabarmati in Flames: Complete Coverage**](http://www.rediff.com/news/godhra.htm) [Back to top](http://www.rediff.com/news/2002/apr/03train3.htm#top) [Tell us what you think of this report](http://20071111034820/mailto:news@rediff.co.in)ADVERTISEMENT
