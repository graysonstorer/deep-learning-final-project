Thousands of residents of this once-placid town, now known around the world as the site of a terror attack that killed five Turkish women and girls, gathered today to lament the attack and bid farewell to their slain neighbors.

"We are horrified," Solingen's Mayor, Gerd Kraimer, told the crowd. "We are deeply ashamed. We ask for forgiveness."

Both in Solingen and at a larger demonstration in Cologne, demonstrators carried signs and shouted slogans aimed at Chancellor Helmut Kohl. He was the only senior German politician who declined to appear at the memorial services. He also rejected appeals that he attend the burial of the five victims in Turkey.

Demonstrators in Solingen carried a large banner reading, "Herr Kohl, Shame on You." A man who interrupted speeches by shouting "Where is the Chancellor?" was greeted with the loudest applause of the day.

In Cologne, Turkish youths hoisted a sign that demanded, "Helmut, Do Something! We Don't Want Another 1940." Many Dignitaries Present

Among the dignitaries present in Cologne were President Richard von Weizsacker; the President of Parliament, Rita Sussmuth; Governor Johannes Rau of North Rhine-Westphalia, and Germany's foreign, interior and labor ministers.
