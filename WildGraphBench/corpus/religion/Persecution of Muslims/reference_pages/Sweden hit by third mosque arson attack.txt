**Stockholm:** Swedish police have launched a manhunt after the third arson attack against a mosque in a week, amid growing tensions over the rise of an anti-immigration far right movement.

"Someone threw a firebomb, a Molotov cocktail, at the building," said Uppsala police spokesman Torsten Hemlin, adding that the mosque in eastern Sweden did not catch fire.

Sweden's Islamic Association posted a photograph online of the main door of the mosque which was emblazoned with the slogan "Go home Muslim shit".

Police in Sweden's fourth largest city Uppsala were alerted by passers-by who reportedly saw a man throw a burning object at the mosque early on Thursday morning.

"The crime has been classed as attempted arson, vandalism and incitement to hatred," the police said, appealing for eyewitnesses to come forward.

The attack came three days after a late night blaze at a mosque in Esloev in southern Sweden which police suspect was also arson.

On Christmas Day,five people were injured when a petrol bomb was thrown through the window of a mosque in Eskilstuna, east of the capital Stockholm.

"People are afraid, they fear for their safety," said Mohammad Kharraki a spokesman for Sweden's Islamic Association..

The attacks come as debate intensifies in Sweden over immigration and the integration of asylum-seekers in the traditionally tolerant Nordic country which is expected to receive more than 100,000 asylum applications this year, breaking all previous records.

Last month the far right Sweden Democrats -- which doubled its support to 13 per cent in September elections -- came close to bringing down the left-green government over its liberal refugee policies. The party's support in opinion polls has since risen to around 16 per cent.

Mr Kharraki said the arson attacks could be carried out by "Sweden Democrats people who are angry because they've been pushed aside. They think Muslims are the problem," he said, while "mainstream political parties have taken a stand against racism and Islamophobia".

However, a spokesman for the Sweden Democrats said there was no reason to consider the attacks to be politically motivated.
