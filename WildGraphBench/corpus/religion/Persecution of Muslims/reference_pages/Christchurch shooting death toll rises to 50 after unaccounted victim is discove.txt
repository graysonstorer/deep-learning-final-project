The death toll of the Christchurch shootings has risen to 50 after a victim, previously not accounted for by police, was discovered at one of the mosques.

At least one gunman with a semi-automatic weapon massacred worshippers gathered for Friday prayers in two locations: a mosque at Deans Avenue in central Christchurch and another mosque in the nearby suburb of Linwood.

New Zealand Police Commissioner Mike Bush said a further examination of the crime scene allowed them to find another victim.

"As of last night, we were able to take all of the victims from both of those scenes and in doing so we have located a victim," he said.

A further 50 people were injured in the attack, Commissioner Bush said, and 36 remain in the Christchurch Hospital, two of whom are in a critical condition.

Four people were arrested, but only 28-year-old Australian man Brenton Tarrant has been charged with murder.

Commissioner Bush said the arrest of two other people found in possession of firearms at a police cordon on Friday "was tangential to this matter", while the fourth person had gone to "assist children in the area to get them safely, but did decide to arm themselves".

More to come.
