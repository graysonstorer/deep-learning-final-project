Several attacks on French mosques following Wednesday's brutal Charlie Hebdo shooting have added to the fear of [retaliation](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/1/7/france-charlie-hebdo.html) against the country's Muslim population.

At least 12 people were shot and killed and more than a dozen others wounded in what is being called a [terror attack](http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/08/europe/charlie-hebdo-attack-timeline/) against the French satirical newspaper on Wednesday. The publication faced threats prior to the shooting and was [firebombed](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/charlie-hebdo-newspaper-attack_n_6429180) in 2011 for publishing cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad.

Two Muslim places of worship and a restaurant affiliated to another mosque were [attacked](http://time.com/3659177/attacks-mosques-charlie-hebdo/) Wednesday evening and Thursday morning local time. Three grenades were thrown at a mosque in Le Mans, west of Paris, and a bullet hole was found in one of the mosque's windows, [AFP reported](http://www.thelocal.fr/20150108/muslim-targets-attacked-after-magazine-killings).

A Muslim prayer hall in the Port-la-Nouvelle district in southern France also received shots shortly after evening prayers, while a [blast](http://www.leprogres.fr/rhone/2015/01/08/explosion-pres-de-la-mosquee-a-villefrance) erupted at L’Imperial, a restaurant affiliated to a mosque in the French village of Villefranche-sur-Saone. No casualties were reported at any of the attacks.

"I am afraid that is linked to the dramatic event that occurred on Wednesday," Villefranche mayor Perrut Bernard told [Le Progress](http://www.leprogres.fr/rhone/2015/01/08/explosion-pres-de-la-mosquee-a-villefrance) on Thursday, referring to the attack on Charlie Hebdo.

Several prominent voices, ranging from [Wallerand de Saint-Just](http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/1/7/france-charlie-hebdo.html) of France's far-right National Front party to atheist author [Richard Dawkins](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/richard-dawkins-religion-charlie-hebdo_n_6430724), took the opportunity to blame Islam in its entirety for promoting violence.

With such rhetoric circling, Peter Neumann, director of the International Center for the Study of Radicalization at King’s College London, argued that Muslims will likely suffer most from backlash. Speaking to [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/08/world/europe/paris-attack-reflects-a-dangerous-moment-for-europe.html?rref=world&module=Ribbon&version=origin&region=Header&action=click&contentCollection=World&pgtype=article&_r=0), Neumann said:

> “Large parts of the European public are latently anti-Muslim, and increasing mobilization of these forces is now reaching into the center of society. If we see more of these incidents, and I think we will, we will see a further polarization of these European societies in the years to come.”

Muslims around the world [condemned Wednesday's attack](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/muslims-respond-charlie-hebdo_n_6429710), rejecting the extremists' distortion of Islam for a violent agenda. Many urged the public not to conflate the religion with these isolated attacks, which will further fan the flames of antagonism.

> France, turning on your own Muslim citizens & "blaming Islam" for [#CharlieHebdo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CharlieHebdo?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) feeds the extremists' agenda. Don't help them.

A man holds a sign reading 'Je suis Charlie' (I am Charlie) as people observe a minute of silence in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris on January 8, 2015 for the victims of an attack by armed gunmen on the offices of French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris on January 7 which left at least 12 dead and many others injured. France observed a minute of silence Thursday, broken only by church bells, in honour of the 12 people killed by apparent jihadists at a magazine known for publishing cartoons deemed offensive to Islam. At midday (1100 GMT), crowds of people stood silently in public squares, schools and outside official buildings. Bells tolled at Paris' Notre Dame cathedral and in churches across the country.

British police officers stand in the rain to hold a two minute silence to show their respect for all those murdered in Wednesday's terrorist attack in Paris, including two police officers, at New Scotland Yard in London, Thursday, Jan. 8, 2015. Masked gunmen stormed the Paris offices of a weekly newspaper that caricatured the Prophet Muhammad, methodically killing 12 people Wednesday, including the editor, before escaping in a car.
