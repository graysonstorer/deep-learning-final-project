The deranged Queens woman who pushed a man to his death on a subway platform was sentenced Wednesday to 24 years in prison.

Erika Menendez, 33, stood silently as Judge Gregory Lasak handed down the sentence.

“Thank you judge,” she said softly as she was slammed with one year less than the maximum for the first-degree manslaughter charge.

Menendez pleaded guilty in March to pushing Sunando Sen in front of the 7 train in 2012.

Lasak said the cold-blooded murder on the 40th St. subway station in Sunnyside was an unconscionable act.

“That’s a horrible way to die,” Lasak said. “You picked out Mr. Sen and you stood behind him and you followed him.”

Menendez said she committed the heinous act because she “hated Hindus and Muslims” ever since 9/11 at the time of her arrest.

Assistant District Attorney Peter Lomp called the case one of the worst in his career.

“It’s about as horrific a crime as I can possibly recall in 22 years of prosecuting,” Lomp said.

Lomp read statements from two of Sen’s friends sitting in the courtroom, who described Sen as a gentle man who came to the United States to leave behind a history of his family’s religious persecution as Hindus in Bangladesh.

“He was a good and honorable man in every way, and was also loved by the entire community in which he worked,” said Bidyut Sarker, a colleague who called Sen as close as a family member.

“A person with this degree of mental illness of blind hatred has no business to walk among us … please protect us,” he urged the judge.

Her lawyer cited previous mental instability for her actions and out-of-character motive.

Menendez had told police she committed the heinous act because she “hated Hindus and Muslims,” ever since 9/11.

Menendez, whose family looked on from the court benches, declined to speak when asked by Lasak if she had anything to say.

Her lawyer, Joseph DeFelice, pointed to his client’s history with mental illness to ask the judge for leniency, saying her statements about targeting Muslims were out of character.

“It’s due to her own mental instability,” DeFelice said. “Whenever she fails to take her medication she turns to self-medicate (with drugs). That’s what leads her to these aggressive acts.”

The judge admonished Menendez for not adhering to the treatment prescribed by the city’s psychiatric professionals around the time of the crime.

“You should have taken that medicine,” he said.
