[Madina Vladimirovna Tlostanova](https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=inauthor:%22Madina+Vladimirovna+Tlostanova%22)

Palgrave Macmillan, Oct 15, 2010 - [Philosophy](https://www.google.com/search?tbo=p&tbm=bks&q=subject:%22Philosophy%22&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0) - 240 pages

In an important contribution to postcolonial, gender, and Eurasian ethnic studies, Madina Tlostanova examines Central Asia and the Caucasus to trace the genealogy of feminism in those regions following the dissolution of the USSR. The forms it takes, she finds, resist interpretation through the lenses of both Western feminist theory and woman of color feminism. Tlostanova argues that Eurasian borderland feminism must chart a third path sensitive to the region's own unique past.
