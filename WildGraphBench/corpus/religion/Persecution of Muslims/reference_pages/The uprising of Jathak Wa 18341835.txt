“…if anyone kill one of the member of the movement of Ja Thak Wa, he will be awarded a big junk of money that has “Phi-Long” seal on it. and anyone kill one of the commander fighter of Ja Thak Wa, they will be awarded greater…”After the dead of Le-Van-Duyet in Saigon in 1832, Emperor Minh-Mang immediately sent his forces to barbarous expedition

Panduranga-Champa before he deicide to wipe out the kingdom of Champa from the Indochina’s map.The perish of the Kingdom of Champa in 1832 led the Champa community into agony situation. They can no longer tolerated the aggressive war,and living under such great oppression, they have no other alternated choice but to find way and form any rebellion movements to fight the invader. A movement that first formed was the movement of Katip Sumat in 1833. Katip Sumat was a Cham Muslim from Makah (Kelantan state, Malaysia). Unfortunately, Katip Sumat movement fail to defend their country in 1834 due to the Daiviet forces were bigger and stronger at that time. The fall of Katip Sumat was just a tinkle of bell showing that there another stronger and well organized movement will be established next that was the movement of Ja Thak Wa, a Cham Muslim from Van-Lam village (Phanrang). He was a leader used to hold many importance position in Panduranga-Champa at the previous time.

The Ja Tak Wa movement was born at the very right time, because it was a time that the people of Champa are facing such a great oppression daily due to the oppressions and harsh policy that the Hue’s Court was post on them. Therefore, Just heard the first call of Ja Thak Wa, people of Champa came together and rise up under the same flag to liberate a nation of Champa. They put all differences aside no matter what religion they believed in or what tribe they were belong to, and what location they are coming from, but just for a sake to liberate Panduranga-Champa, and to restore whatever the emperor Minh-Mang has destroyed. Such as economic system, social system, History and culture and traditional, etc. To advance a purpose, in the year of Horse (nassak athaik) in 1834. Ja Thak Wa bring forward the first action was to reorganize and redraw a new strategy how to liberated some of the region that needed to liberated first from Dong-Nai-Thuong region to Kauthara state (Nhatrang and Phuyen present day).

REVISE THE DYNASTY OF KING PO ROME

After completed prepare the war zone, Ja Thak Wa gathering the nation Assembly to appoint Po War Plei a Raglai descendant from Cadang village to be King (Po Patrai) of Panduranga State. He is a brother in-law of Po Dhar Kaok (Nguyen-Van-Nguyen a Vietnamese name) and were a deputy of King Po Phaok-The (1828-1832) in Panduranga State. Along with this promotion of appointing, Ja Thak Wa consecrated a Churu descendant a potion of Cei Aia Harei (prince of the sun) to be a prince to succeed to the throne, and Ja Yok Ai a Cham descendant to be a Panroang Sa-Ai (a Military leader).

We ought to know that Po War Plei is related to King Po Rome, a King that created a dynasty 6 th of Panduranga from 1627 to the last throne of Po Ceng Cei Brei (1783-1786) since Po Ceng Cei Brei gave up his throne and fled to Kampuchea seek refuge in 1786. The appointment of the leading person to the position above at that time proved that Ja Thak Wa wants to revise the dynasty of Panduranga to became an independent state. Noting that, even though the Cham history wrote that Po War Plei came to the throne and was recognized by the people of Champa but, the Hue’s Court see it just as a group of the savage and illiterate people no more or less. (…) came to stole the properties and attack the Viet people living in the land of Panduranga.

THE STRATEGY OF KATIP JA THAK WA

In order to get ready to launch an uprising, Ja Thak Wa leading the movement and change all the region from the west mountain of Phu-yen, Khanh-Hoa and Binh-Thuan-Thanh became a reserve region, in the other hand, this leader know how to depend on the people of highlander (Raglai, Churu, Koho, and Stieng ..etc.) from Dong-Nai-Thuong zone were a strong force that always fought to defend there region from the attack of the Viet invader since 1832. By the help of Po War Plei and with the prince to succeed the throne in the group make Katip Ja Thak Wa an easier to recruit the people from the highland to join his movement. To begin launching the war, Katip Ja Thak Wa first sent his rebellion arose and bravely fought the Viet invader from Dong-Nai-Thuong zone and then all the way from Phanri to Phu-Yen region in the 7 th month of the year of Lamb (nassak athaik 1834). The rebellion rose led by Katip Ja Thak Wa caused a significant change with the political realm in the land of Panduranga.

THE LAND OF BOILING POT OF THE POLICY OF MINH-MANG

During the up rising of the movement of Ja Thak Wa, Emperor Minh Mang, did not hesitate to apply the land boiling pot policy toward the fighter from the movement. According to Ariya Gleng Anak (poem, or tail of history) wrote in 1835, Minh Mang launch an attack Katip Ja Thak Wa movement in the 7 th month of the year of Lamb (nassak athaik 1834) Champa calendar were a terrifying and bloodiest war where the ammunition explored from and gun battle shook the ground up to the sky. All the resident home of the Champa people were burn to ash and destroyed completely by fire. In order to frighten the rebellion, Minh Mang used a terrible and inhuman tool to punish the fighter royal to Katip Ja Thak Wa.

Rely on the land boiling pot policy, Minh Mang has won the first battle with Ja Thak Wa rebellion. Even though Ja Thak Wa has lost the first battle, but he thought that this lost just due to the fact that Champa people were not stick and woe together to fight against the enemy as his wished.

KATIP JA THAK WA AND THE IRON RULES

Before prepare for a second uprising, on the 10 th month of the year of the Lamb, the Champa calendar (1835). Katip Ja Thak Wa order to appoint a commander of the rebellion force to be a Chru and Raglai descendant because they will be neutrally and carefully purge and apply a tough rule of punishment to whomever doesn't wants to join the rebellion movement just because they afraid of a revenge by Minh Mang. Due to a tough discipline, the second battle led by Katip Ja Thak Wa was victory over all the regions that were controlled by Minh Mang in the early year 1835.

For Minh Mang, Panduranga is an importance zone for political strategy of war. therefore, in order to recapture Panduranga and to restore power at the Hue’s Court in the south again, he has to direct command his military at the battle field. His first priority was to use harshly punishment to get rid of all his former feckless commander that could not fought against the Ja Thak Wa rebellion fighter in Panduranga.

A POLICY OF EXTERMINATED

According to the Champa history wrote that Minh Mang has ordered his militia that anyone who kill a fighter of Ja Thak Wa will be rewarded a big chunk of money that have a Phi-Long seal. And anyone kill a commander of Ja Thak Wa fighter will be reward greater. Minh Mang also ordered his militia somehow to beheaded at least three of the Ja Thak Wa fighter per day then they will be grant his salary and benefit otherwise he will be punished. Therefore, the Minh Mang’s militant took advantage of the benefit to fight harder, and competed each other to kill even the innocent people of Champa as much as they can just to get the benefit. This is a clear and frightened case of massacre by Minh Mang's policy to exterminated and destroy the whole nation of Champa, the case that were never happened to any race on this earth.

AN EXHUME POLICY OF MINH MANG

Beside enforcing a policy of extermination the people of Champa ordered by Minh Mang to receive a benefit as described above, Minh Mang also entrusted his militia to freely massacred, deported and jailed the Ja Thak Wa rebellion fighter and rush to converted the whole nation of the people of Champa to be slave for the Viet. They started to burn out the palace, the residential home, the villages of the Champa people into dust, and stolen the land, the properties and all belonging to the Champa people, and destroy all the sacred places and exhume their forefather and the place of respected (Kut) for the Cham people to worship their ancestors such as the grave of Po Kloang Haluw (1567-1591/1579-1603), Po Saong Nyung Ceng (1799-1822), and burn out the Po Rome temple.

After completely destroyed the nation and exhume the ancestors Champa, and to prevent another rebellion movement should rose up in the future, Minh Mang started redraw the map of Panduranga state. He ordered the Champa people to move out from their resident in to another location close by or among the Vietnamese community so that the Champa people have no chance to get together. From then, the social culture and tradition life gradually beginning either be destroyed or vanished and fade away. All the old Champa grave yard laying along the Oceanside in central Vietnam today especially in Phanrang and Phanri province is a valuable tool to prove to the world for an horrible criminal act toward the Champa people by emperor Minh Mang of Daiviet.

Depend on the power of Minh Mang and the protection by Hue's Court, the Viet people acting like they are the owner of the land of Panduranga, and they took advantages of the policy that post by Minh Mang to order the Champa people to move out from their properties so they can freely started to occupy the land that were left by the Champa people.

Finally, the Minh Mang has ordered to separate the Champa Highland from the lowland apart so that he can easily control the these people. Minh Mang believed that with this policy he can prevented the further communication in between this communities that most loyal to Katip Ja Thak Wa, and so that they will never be regroup to rise up against the invader of Minh Mang.

A PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE

Along with the policy of exterminated the people of Champa, Minh Mang has thought that a psychological warfare is an important war to fight among the Cham to separated them from the revolution movement of Katip Ja Thak Wa a revolution that the Champa people respected and loyal to. Therefore, the Minh Mang's administrator started to call on the Champa to renounce the believe in Ja Thak Wa and stop having a felling of distrust the Viet administration and believe in the Hue's Court for support.

Beside the open arm policy, Minh Mang has find way to pacify the intellectual and noble Cham Panduranga descendant to stay on his side. One of the men that Minh Mang wanted most were a sister of Mr. Dhar Koak (a former deputy of dynasty, Panduranga 1828-1832) a wife of Po War Plei. and another that Minh Mang also wanted was Po Phoak-The, a former King of Panduranga (1828-1832) and want to promoted him to a position of Dien An Ba (Ba Tuoc Dien An), but the position were never reaching him, due to the fact that in June 1835, Po Phaok-The was charged by the Hue's Court to have a death penalty by chopping his hand off, then his foot and then cut each part of his body so that he is slowly die in pain., It was a horrible Charge during the time of Minh Mang.

Even though the Minh Mang has impose many horrible strategy to fight and destroy the revolution movement of Ja Thak Wa, but the blooding war in between the Movement of Ja Thak Wa with the Viet still goes on in the battle of Panduranga until April 1835, mark the day of Po War Plei and Katip Ja Thak Wa died on the Battle field near Huuduc commune, Vanlam Village, Phanrang. Even though these two were death, but the Hue's Court still order to behead and bring them to show the Champa communities around.

Panduranga-Champa was a piece of land undergoing a terrifying and bloody war between Nguyen-Anh and Tay-Son, destabilizing the country. This small piece of land was repeatedly invaded, and exchanged hands between Nguyen-Anh, and Tay-son. The Panduranga-Champa people were innocent victims of a war that brought their nation to chaos, causing heavy burdens and much suffering.

The death of Katip Ja Thak Wa in April 1835 has turned the new page of the Champa history, the history of a nation without leader, military and government. The death of Katip Ja Thak Wa also mark the change of the leader and name of our beloved Panduranga. The nation of Champa now no longer belong to the Champa Kingdom, but became a citizen of Vietnam, a citizen of an alien that have no any right over their land and even have no right over their own life.

Through out 16 century, thousand and thousand of Champa warriors have died not for the sake of conquer other people land, but just for a sovereignty of the country and for a human dignity that they expected to have while they are still living in their own land. Katip Ja Thak Wa was one of the warrior that sacrifice his for this cause.

Ja Thak Wa was death on the 4th month of the year of At Vi in 1835, but his name, and his soul never died and will live for ever in the mind of the people of Champa.. Long live Katip Ja Thak Wa.
