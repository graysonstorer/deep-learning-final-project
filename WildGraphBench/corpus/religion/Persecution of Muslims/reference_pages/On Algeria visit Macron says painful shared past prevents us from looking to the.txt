# On Algeria visit, Macron says 'painful' shared past 'prevents us from looking to the future'

Speaking in Algiers shortly after arriving for a three-day visit, [Macron](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/emmanuel-macron/) expressed the hope that France and Algeria would be able to “look back at the past with humility” in order to establish trust and cooperation in the future.

"We have a complex, painful common past. And it has at times prevented us from looking to the future," said Macron.

He said a joint committee with historians from both Algeria and France will be set up to study the archives on both sides on the colonial period, promising to push for "unfettered access" to documents.

For his part, Algerian President [Abdelmadjid Tebboune](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/abdelmadjid-tebboune/)said Macron’s visit was an opportunity to re-energise cooperation and partnership between the two countries.

Tebboune welcomed what he called the "encouraging results" of Macron's visit so far, hailing a "positive dynamic" in their relationship.He went on to say there were "promising prospects for improving the special partnership that binds us".

The first French president to be born after [Algerian](https://www.france24.com/en/tag/algeria/) independence, Macron is hoping "to lay a foundation to rebuild and develop" a sometimes difficult relationship with the North African nation, his office said.

Accompanied by seven ministers, Macron arrived at the Houari Boumediene Airport in the capital Algiers, where he was received by his Algerian counterpart.

The two heads of state visited a monument on Thursday to martyrs of the country's war for independence, which ended more than 130 years of French colonial rule with Algeria's independence in 1962.

Franco-Algerian relations have seen repeated crises since then.

The French leader, on his second visit to Algeria since he took power in 2017, "has chosen to direct this visit towards the future, (focusing on) start-ups, innovation, youth, new sectors," the Élysee said on Tuesday.

Macron, alongside a 90-strong delegation, will meet entrepreneurs in Algiers as well as young people in the second city Oran.

Ties between Paris and Algiers have been particularly stormy since last year, when[Macron questioned Algeria's existence as a nation](https://www.france24.com/en/france/20211002-algeria-recalls-ambassador-to-france-for-consultations)before the French occupation and accused the government of fomenting "hatred towards France".

Tebboune withdrew his country's ambassador in response and banned French military aircraft from its airspace.

Better ties 'a political necessity'
-----------------------------------

But Macron's office issued a statement saying he "regretted" the misunderstandings caused by his comments, and his aides believe that both sides have moved on.

They note the resumption of normal diplomatic relations and overflights to French army bases further south in Africa.

Analyst Mansour Kedidir said that, "given instability in the Maghreb region, conflicts in the Sahel and the war in Ukraine, improving ties between France and Algeria is a political necessity".

Macron and Tebboune will discuss the situation in Algeria's southern neighbour Mali, as well as the growing regional clout of Russia, Algeria's top arms supplier.

France's latest efforts to mend ties comes as Algeria moves to fill a vast shortfall in gas supplies to Europe following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

European nations are seeking to end their dependence on Russian hydrocarbons, giving Algeria – Africa's biggest gas exporter with direct pipelines to Spain and Italy – renewed clout.

"The French president will certainly ask Algeria to make an effort to try to increase its gas production," said Algerian economist Abderrahmane Mebtoul.

But Macron's office has said that gas is not a major feature of the visit, and an adviser said the trip is "about being oriented towards the future".

'Different discourse'
---------------------

Macron has long ruled out issuing an apology for the highly sensitive issue of colonialism, but he has made a series of gestures aimed at healing past wounds.

In Algiers, few have much sympathy towards the French leader, who during his first election campaign in 2017 had described French colonialism as a "crime against humanity".

"Before he was president, he used nice words, he visited (Algeria), but right after he went back to France, he changed," said computer scientist Othmane Abdellouche, 62. "He used a totally different discourse".

French historians say half a million civilians and combatants died during Algeria's bloody war for independence, 400,000 of them Algerian. The Algerian authorities say 1.5 million were killed.

Tebboune's office said in October that more than 5.6 million Algerians were killed during the colonial period.

Algerian rights groups have also urged Macron not to overlook human rights abuses by the government that came to power after long-time leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika stepped down in 2019.

Tebboune, a prime minister under Bouteflika, has clamped down on the Hirak opposition movement that forced his predecessor to resign.
