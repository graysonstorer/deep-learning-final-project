**American Conquest of the Philippines** (1899-1902): **220 ,000** [[make link](https://necrometrics.com/20c100k.htm#Phil-Am)]
*   John Gates ("War-Related Deaths in the Philippines, 1898-1902", _Pacific Historical Review_ 53:367 (1983)) estimates a demographic shortfall between 127,593 and 362,659. A 1902 cholera epidemic killed a recorded 137,505, so the absolute most that could have died in the war would be 225,154 (362659-137505). 
    *   According to Gates: The most commonly cited number is 600,000, which is based on General Bell's 1901 comment that 1/6 of Luzon had died. There is, however, uncertainty over which "General Bell" said this, and how knowledgeable he would be.
    *   The second most commonly cited number is probably 200,000, which also has an uncertain origin, but was already in circulation by 1913.
    *   Sometimes you'll hear 3 million mentioned, but this originated as a typo in _West Point: America's Power Fraternity_. Because 3 million is so shocking, it has a tendency to stick in people's mind and get repeated (_Compton's_, under "Philippines", for example, gives the death toll as 1-3M). In any case, the passage was _supposed_ to say 300,000.

*   According to the Library of Congress [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/sotoc.html], this war caused the deaths of about one third of the northern Somali population. The 1911 Britannica estimates 300,000 people in British Somaliland, so the death toll might have been something like 100-150,000. (depending on whether the 300000 was estimated before or after the one-third had died)
*   By summing the battle casualties in the campaigns that are descibed in the OnWar.com essay for the 1899-1905 phase of the war, I determined that the dervishes suffered some 11,700 casualties (K+W) fighting the British, which would come to around 3,000 KIA, plus another 1,000 killed in battle with the Abyssinians. The British lost something over 200 KIA.

*   Adam Hochschild, _Leopold's Ghost_, (1998) estimates a 50% population loss in the rain forest due to colonial brutality. Robert July (_A History of the African People_, 1974) reports a 1926 population estimate of 3.1M in all of FrEqAf. The 1946 Census found 25% of the FrEqAfan population (1054T/4131T) in Congo and Gabon, the forest territories. That indicates a 1926 forest population of 0.8M, and therefore, an earlier death toll of 800,000.
