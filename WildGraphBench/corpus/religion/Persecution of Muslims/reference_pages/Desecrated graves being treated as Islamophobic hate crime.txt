Up to 100 graves were desecrated. _(Image: Wadi Funeral)_

 This article is brought to you by our exclusive subscriber partnership with our sister title USA Today, and has been written by our American colleagues. It does not necessarily reflect the view of The Herald. 

An attack on up to 100 Muslim graves is now being treated as an Islamophobic hate crime, police have confirmed.

The force made the announcement as part of the ongoing investigation into the crime at Carpenders Park Lawn Cemetery, which saw plaques for babies and young children among those damaged.

![Image 9](https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/19339360/?type=mds-article-575%20575w)_(Image: Wadi Funeral)_ Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson, head of Hertfordshire’s local policing command, said: “We are continuing to investigate every line of enquiry into this terrible crime, which we are now treating as an Islamophobic act.

“During the initial stages of our investigation we explored several hypotheses as to how the damage may have occurred and for this reason, we had to be mindful of the words used to describe the incident in the public domain."

![Image 10: Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson.](https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/19338410/?type=mds-article-575%20575w)Chief Superintendent Jon Simpson. _(Image: Herts Police)_ He added: "However, now our inquiry has progressed we are confident that sadly, this was a religiously motivated act. We would like to reassure those affected, and the wider Muslim community, that we are continuing to treat this crime extremely seriously.”

It comes as Watford Borough Council said it is "working closely with police and local faith groups to safeguard North Watford Cemetery".

![Image 11](https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/19338404/?type=mds-article-575%20575w)_(Image: Wadi Funeral)_ The force are in liaison with Brent Council - which owns the site - as they work to identify the affected families.

Sergeant Irfan Ishaq, chair of the Hertfordshire Association of Muslim Police, said: "Since the news of this religiously motivated act reached our Muslim communities, I have been listening to and recording their feedback and concerns. We completely understand their frustration at the delay in confirming it as a hate crime and stand with them in their condemnation of this dreadful incident.

“I’m sure the public can appreciate that as police, it is important for us to approach every incident reported to us with an open mind to ensure an unbiased and fair investigation."

He continued: "Our focus remains identifying the families of those whose graves have been affected so we can provide support and advice, and our partners at Brent Council are assisting us with this. Given the number of graves involved, and the fact that many of the families affected may no longer live locally, we anticipate that this will take some time as we continue to be sensitive and respectful in our work.

“We recognise that news of this crime will not only impact the Muslim community, but those from all walks of life. There will continue to be a police presence in and around the cemetery to reassure our community and provide advice where needed. In addition, a further community leaders meeting is being held tomorrow (Wednesday April 16) to keep our Muslim community informed.”

![Image 12: Cllr Muhammed Butt](https://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/resources/images/15556655/?type=mds-article-575%20575w)Cllr Muhammed Butt _(Image: Archant)_ Brent Council leader Muhammed Butt said: "Our thoughts are with the families of those whose graves were desecrated, I cannot imagine how they must be feeling at this moment.

“This is a very serious incident, and we continue to work closely with Hertfordshire Police to inform family members and bring the perpetrators to justice. I encourage anyone who thinks they have information that will help the investigation to contact police."

Responding to the attacks,Saqib Nadeem, president of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Association Watford, said: "We are heartbroken by the desecration of Muslim graves. Islam teaches us to honour the deceased with dignity and to respond to wrongdoing with patience and wisdom. While this act has caused immense pain, we must channel our grief into prayers and through fostering unity and healing.”

Police believe the desecration occurred between 1pm on April 11 and 5pm the following day.

Officers have urged anyone who believes their loved one's grave may have been affected to contact anna.cornish@herts.police.uk directly and quote the reference 'Op Lunate' with their contact details.
