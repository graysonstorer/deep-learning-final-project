Ahmedabad: The conspiracy theory, propounded by the Gujarat police and now seconded by Justice Nanavati C o m m i s s i o n�s probe into the Godhra train burning on February 27, 2002, hinges heavily on evidence that the key accused in the killing of 59 VHP kar sevaks aboard the ill-fated Sabarmati Express had purchased 140 litres of petrol the previous day. 
����The judge has concluded that this was done clearly with the intention of burning the train-load of VHP activists from Gujarat who were returning from Ayodhya. The buying of petrol just hours before the train was to arrive at Godhra and the storing of the liquid fuel in cans at Aman Guest House run by alleged key conspirator Razzak Kurkur, is a key piece of evidence Nanavati has heavily relied upon.

����While all accounts indicate that Godhra train burning by a mob was in retaliation to the beating up of Muslim vendors at the railway station by kar sevaks, the conspiracy theory is reinforced by forensic examination of the burnt S-6 compartment which concluded that inflammable liquid was poured into the compartment before setting it on fire. Nanavati relies on police witnesses who speak about the influential Muslim cleric, Maulvi Husain Haji Ibrahim Umarji, being the brain behind the attack. Also, a former CRPF constable, Nannumiyan, a native of Assam who used to frequent Kurkur�s guest house and incite the Muslims. There are references to Gulamnabi and Ali Mohammed, both Kashmiris, who were in Godhra for a fortnight before the incident and had spoken to the accused about the Kashmiri liberation movement.

����Their roles are not discussed in detail in the report and what comes out about the planning of the conspiracy is rather sketchy. The real stuff begins only around 10 pm on February 26, when Kurkur and his aides went to the petrol pump and filled up seven or eight 20-litre cans.
