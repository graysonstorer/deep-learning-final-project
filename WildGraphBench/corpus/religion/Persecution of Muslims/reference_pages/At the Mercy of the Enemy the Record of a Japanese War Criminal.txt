# Introduction

When the Imperial Rescript of Surrender

announcing Japan’s acceptance of the terms of the

Potsdam Declaration was broadcast to the Japanese

people on 15th August 1945, there were six million

Japanese living outside the home islands

(Kobayashi, 2000) and, in the months that followed,

over 700,000 Japanese military personnel

surrendered to Allied forces in South East Asia alone

(Kibata, 2000). In striking contrast to these figures

is the small number of Japanese combatants

captured as prisoners of war (POWs) during the

Asian Pacific conflict, estimates varying between

42,543, the figure given by the wartime Japanese

government’s POW Information Bureau (Hata,

1996), and 19,500 (Gilmore, 1998). According to

Hata (1996), the ratio of Japanese troops captured to

those killed in the course of the war was 1 : 40,

compared with 4 : 1 among Western armies. This

preference for death over the dishonour of

surrender, exemplified in the banzai suicide charges

on Attu Island and Saipan, is generally attributed to

the Imperial Japanese Army’s Field Service Code

(Senjinkun) issued in January 1941 in which the

Emperor’s subject is instructed to guard his

reputation zealously : “Never live to experience

shame as a prisoner. By dying you will avoid leaving

behind the crime of a stain on your honour” (Straus

2003:39). However, as Straus points out :

By the time it was issued, the spirit of the

Senjinkun was so deeply imbedded in the national

psyche that it was more than a military directive

to a single service. It had become an imperative

not only for the military but also for civilians

attached to the military and ultimately for all

civilians, including even women and children

(Straus, 2003:40).

This reluctance to be taken prisoner was reinforced

by a common belief among Japanese troops that it＊ Michael SKELTON 教育学部教授29would result in torture and death at the hands of the

enemy. There was also the fear that, should they be

captured and later returned to Japan, their own

government would have them shot for transgressing

the ban on surrender, a consequence that the

Japanese had made known to their servicemen

(Fedorowich, 2000). Unsurprisingly, for those who

were taken prisoner, either willingly or after being

wounded, and were repatriated at the end of the war,

there appears to have been a desire to keep their

former POW status secret and not discuss their

treatment in Allied POW camps (Sturma, 2016).

Compared with the wealth of literature in English on

or by former prisoners of the Japanese, some of

which has taken its place in popular culture (e. g.,

Ernest Gordon’s 1962 book Through the Valley of the

Kwai, later adapted for the cinema as ‘To End All

Wars’, and Eric Lomax’s The Railway Man of 1995,

also adapted for the big screen), their Japanese

counterparts in the postwar years produced few

accounts of their experiences as POWs, a notable

exception being Ooka Shohei’s Furyoki (1952),

translated into English as Taken Captive. Even in

Ooka’s case, however, the stigma attached to

surrender was still alive nearly thirty years after the

event, as evidenced by his unwillingness to accept a

literary prize in 1971 because of the shame that he

continued to feel (Roland, 1996).

This paper focuses on the post‒surrender

experiences of a former Kempeitai officer, Misaka

Tatsuo, through a translation into English of his

‘Notes of a War Criminal’ (Sempanshuki). Written

at the instigation of a Kempeitai veterans’

association and covering the period from October

1945 to the end of December 1946, this account is

handwritten on nineteen numbered sheets of A5 size

paper and describes his treatment in captivity by the

Australian military while awaiting interrogation for

war crimes. Although the ‘Notes’ are not dated, the

author reveals that they are based on notes

originally written on pages of a memo pad while he

was held in Sugamo Prison in Tokyo in the early

1950s.

# Some biographical details

Little is known about Misaka Tatsuo’s military

career. It seems that he seldom spoke about this

time of his life, even to his family. He was born the

eldest of eleven children in Fukuoka, west Japan, in

January 1919, and his early years were spent in

Osaka. His father’s work took the family to Busan

(Fuzan in Japanese‒controlled Korea) when the

young Tatsuo was five and he lived there until his

late teens. After preparatory study at a youth

training institute (Seinenkunrenjo), he enrolled in

the elite Nakano School (Rikugun Nakano Gakko) in

Tokyo, the main training centre for Japan’s military

intelligence operations. Such was the secrecy

surrounding this school for spies that graduates

were forbidden to talk about it or about the training

that they had received. This would explain, at least

in part, Misaka’s reticence on the subject of his

wartime career. He was inducted into the

Kempeitai, Japan’s military secret police, in January

1940, a few days before his 21st birthday. From his

‘Notes’ we learn that he served in the Keijo (Seoul)

Kempeitai before being posted to Borneo, which had

come under Japanese control in March 1942. By the

time Japanese forces surrendered to Allied troops in

September 1945, Misaka was a sergeant in the

Tawau Kempei unit of the 37th Army Kempeitai

and, along with 2, 900 other Japanese soldiers in

Tawau, was transferred to Jesselton (present‒day

Kota Kinabalu). He was imprisoned in the Labuan

Island Internment Camp for War Criminals and was

later transferred to Jurong Camp and Changi Jail,

both in Singapore. He was repatriated to Japan in

1950, being officially demobilized in March of that

year, and was subsequently detained in Sugamo

Prison. What crime he was convicted of, and what

length of sentence he was given, remains unknown,

and he may have been released soon after the

American occupation of Japan ended in 1952. He

was definitely free by 1958 when the Japanese

government decided to release all war criminals

from prison (Felton, 2012). Following his release,

he returned to Osaka and set up an optician’s shop教 育 学 論 究 第 12 号 2 0 2 030selling jewellery and watches in addition to eyewear.

He died in February 1997 aged 78.

Misaka refers in his memoir to the fact that he was

a member of the Kempeitai and that this had some

bearing on the way he was treated by his captors, so

it is worth briefly considering this institution and the

increasing influence that it exerted on the Japanese

power structure during, and in the decade prior to,

the Asian Pacific War. In their own historical

records (Nihon Kenpei Seishi) Kempeitai veterans

admit that their primary role was one of control and

suppression (Shimer and Hobbs, 2010), and the

methods that they employed to achieve this

objective spread terror through the population.

Sometimes compared to the Gestapo in Nazi

Germany (Russell, 1958 ; Felton, 2012), they

targeted leftwing dissidents and pacifists in Japan

and cracked down on anti‒Japanese activities in the

overseas territories under Japanese control. During

the war the Kempeitai were in charge of POW

camps where, in filthy, overcrowded and

disease‒ridden conditions, prisoners were routinely

subjected to brutal treatment by their guards.

Among the native population of north Borneo, where

Misaka spent his final posting, a climate of fear and

suspicion was rife :

The Kempeitai was literally ‘everywhere’ ; its

network of informers could be one’s neighbour or

a casual acquaintance or simply anyone who might

report on your intransigencies. Notoriously

violent, cruel and sadistic, the Kempeitai sent

shudders throughout the local community. Their

modus operandi of ‘torture preceding

interrogation’ was legendary and largely

contributed to the general atmosphere of fear

amongst the population (Ooi, 2011:53).

The Kempeitai was officially disbanded by General

MacArthur in November 1945 but few former

members were repatriated directly to Japan. Most

were investigated for war crimes, those charged

being put on trial in the countries where their

alleged crimes were committed (Narayanan, 2002).

In these B and C class trials, lower‒ranking Kempei

officers and men came off worse than regular army

troops. In Java alone almost two out of every five

ex‒Kempeitai were convicted of war crimes, while

for regular Japanese soldiers the figure was one in

every four hundred (Shimer and Hobbs, 2010). It

would appear, therefore, that Misaka’s Kempeitai

background played a significant role in his fate post

surrender.

In the following translation of Misaka Tatsuo’s

Sempanshuki (‘Notes of a War Criminal’), the section

headings are those of the original author.

# Notes of a War Criminal

When I happened to attend a meeting in

Shirahama of the Borneo Kempeitai Veterans’

Association, I was asked by General Secretary

Furukawa to write and publish any notes I had.

While I was held at Sugamo Detention Centre, I

made up my mind to eventually organize the notes I

wrote in my cell. These painful memories of the

postwar period, written as a testament for my

family, were pasted together with boiled rice grains

and placed in a box and I treasure them as an

heirloom.

Among these memories, the first is of war

criminals and slave ships, from disembarking from

the Australian slave ship to the Labuan Island

prisoner‒of‒war camp. Together with recollections

of the miscellaneous chores imposed on us by the

Australian military police and those of the Jurong

internment camp in Singapore, I stitched together

my record.

# War criminals and slave ships

This is a true record of what I personally

experienced, a form of retaliation for the cruelty and

ill‒treatment I received day and night, memories of

which persist for a lifetime. After the war ended

they were drunk with the feeling of victory while we,

with our weapons snatched from us and unable to

resist, were as defenceless as babies and violentlyAt the Mercy of the Enemy : the Record of a Japanese War Criminal31mistreated to a point just short of being killed, with

no time to catch our breath. These events date back

to October following the end of the war. At that

time I was serving in the Tawau Kempeitai

regiment of the 37th Army Kempeitai in Borneo.

After the Tawau Incident, public order among the

native population was stable, and not a single enemy

soldier had come ashore during the war. Unlike in

other regions, there were no prisoner‒of‒war

related problems, and, while urban areas were being

abandoned, with enemy aircraft attacking before

and after the landing on Tarakan Island in southern

Borneo, there was no engagement with the enemy.

In mid‒October contact with the natives was

forbidden by order of Australian Military

Headquarters and it was impossible to purchase food

supplies. We had previously adopted a

self‒sufficient attitude so we lived on tapioca and

wild warabi bracken. Suddenly, on 21st October, we

were ordered to embark without a moment’s delay

and, with just a government‒issued knapsack and

accompanied by a battalion of guards, all twenty‒one

members of the Kempeitai and about eight hundred

Japanese residents were assembled. On the way to

the jetty I was frequently ordered to stop by

Australian soldiers waiting in ambush on the road,

and by carrying out body searches they stole just

about everything of value among my personal

belongings, such as my watch and fountain pen.

Some things were thrown away into a river or were

given to native onlookers. Finally, we were put

aboard a ship and, with no idea of our destination, we

set out to sea.

At daybreak on the second day, the ship suddenly

stopped and the order was given : “Kempeitai only

go ashore first.” I sensed that something was going

on. The landing craft was still about one hundred

metres from the beach and, as there were no boats to

ferry us ashore, we hesitated. An Australian sailor

suddenly shouted at us in an angry voice, “Kammon !

Harriap !” and raised a stick aloft over his head. Not

understanding what he said, we all stripped naked

and, with just a few belongings perched on our heads,

we jumped into the sea. The morning seawater was

cold but we finally reached the beach. A nearby

Australian soldier took liberties rummaging through

our personal belongings. After he left, an official

came to search us but we had nothing valuable left.

Around that time Japanese civilians, including

women and children, were starting to come ashore in

inflatable boats.

Naked as we were, we were made to run at double

time on the beach for about an hour. I found out that

this place was Jesselton. Eventually, someone who

seemed to be an inspector came and noted down our

names and unit, and finally we were allowed to put

on our clothes. The Australian soldier from before

reappeared and all of a sudden started kicking and

hitting us, amusing himself by throwing afar the

clothes we were trying to put on.

At length one of the Australian soldiers led us off.

After we had walked about 300 metres along the

shore, he suddenly pointed out to sea and shouted

again, “Kammon ! Harriap !” None of us understood

what was said and, as we stood there in a daze, a

group of seven or eight men dressed in swimwear

and intent on aggression jumped from a landing boat

and made their way towards us. They arrived in

force, unleashing violence on us without warning.

They seemed to be telling us to get on board again.

Still in our military uniforms, we set off towards the

ship out at sea. As we did so, we were pushed down

into the water, kicked and punched. In the end we

could offer no resistance. If we came up to the

surface, a large man would sit astride us so that we

went under again. He didn’t even give us time to

catch out breath. I threw away my belongings, my

mind fixed on getting to the ship as quickly as

possible, but my movements were restricted and my

vision clouded, and I felt half‒dead. Ah, this is hell on

earth, I thought. My comrades‒in‒arms were

receiving the same abuse. Faced with continuous

humiliation, I resolved to die and tried to reach the

ship’s hull, but a sailor dived into the water and

pulled me up. On a certain signal the abuse was all

at once brought under control. The water was

coming up to my chin, but I finally caught hold of a

door on the ship and they gestured to me to climb up.教 育 学 論 究 第 12 号 2 0 2 032With great effort I tried to raise my body, heavy as

lead, but it wouldn’t move. Push them up from

behind, someone shouted.

Although this was an action that people who live

together daily naturally understand, there was

confusion to an unimaginable degree. Our

commanding officer was the first to be pushed up.

As they raised him, they shouted at him loudly and

then chased him with a square piece of timber till he

disappeared into the ship’s interior. I expected more

abuse but couldn’t avoid being hauled up, and, as we

were pushed up one by one, we were struck with the

timber. For the Australians it might have been half

in fun, but we were desperate as we ran about

twenty metres into the dimly lit interior. Here and

there we encountered groups of men whose job it

was to dish out rough treatment, and, wielding rods

over their heads, they looked like demons. All of a

sudden I received head‒on a blast of water from a

hose and it knocked me over. Then I was punched

and kicked again. Finally, we were made to take off

our uniforms and use them as rags to scrub the deck.

There was no sensation in my backside, leaving it

free from pain, and I crawled along with a rigid

posture as I rubbed the deck, my throat parched

from the seawater I had swallowed. Water from the

hose had flooded the ship’s hold and, before long, we

were told through gestures to scoop the water with

both hands and throw it overboard. We scooped up

the water and took it to the prow of the ship about

twenty metres away to get rid of it. I acted knowing

the absurdity of this order. Soaked with sweat and

bitter tears, I couldn’t run five metres without the

water I had scooped up leaking away through my

fingers, while they chased and struck me from

behind.

This happened to all of us. If that was not enough,

I was also kicked in the backside and sent headlong

into the sea. When I eventually managed to crawl

back on board, I was made to run again. My parched

throat was choking me and I had no idea how much

time passed as these actions were repeated. None of

our group collapsed with exhaustion, though. We

knew that, if we didn’ t move, there would be a

heavier punishment, so, gasping for breath, we just

kept moving. After a while, the branch manager of

the Nissan Agriculture and Forestry Company,

Chief of Police Hiroba and Inspector Nagata were

pushed forward. The branch manager, who was

thought to be over 60 years old, was forced to do the

same work as us. What a cruel spectacle it was !

I don’t know how much time elapsed, but one or

two of the sailors involved in the ill‒treatment

disappeared from view. A high‒ranking officer

came and seemed to tell us to stop work. The area

round about us was covered in water. My tired body

felt as limp as cotton and I had a sense of being

hardly alive. Glancing at my comrades’ faces,

though, I could feel how admirably we had survived

up till now, watching out for each other. We simply

stood there in a stupor, holding our uniforms that

had substituted as rags. One of us had a bucket, and

he went off following a sailor and soon returned

carrying fresh water. Extreme fatigue and fear over

what challenges still lay ahead prevented us from

approaching the water. The Australian officer said,

“O. K.” and went off somewhere. Everyone silently

picked up the lid of their mess kit and in turn

received some water. Our bellies seemed swollen

with hunger. Someone said, “I’m glad none of us is

badly injured and we’re all alive.” In this way we

cheered one another up. When we had finished

drinking the water, two men were led away but

returned holding their bags.

Presently, we got some food. Thirty minutes after

we had eaten, the next step was to transport wheat

flour. The distance was only three metres but, once

we had carried a sack to the designated place, the

next person had to carry it back to the original place.

This was obviously not work but abuse designed to

pass the time. When someone staggered, he was

kicked and fell down. He would then have to get up

again and carry the sack. Our whole bodies became

white with flour and we could only tell one person

apart from another by their eyes and nose. Like

sodden rats covered in flour we truly cut pathetic

figures. My eyes were overflowing with tears of

vexation. How long would we have to work likeAt the Mercy of the Enemy : the Record of a Japanese War Criminal33this ? Eventually, an order came from the hatch to

climb up the stairs and come out on deck. We were

told to wash ourselves so we went to the shower

room and rinsed off the flour from our bodies.

The next task was to clean the toilets. I scrubbed

the toilet bowl with my hand and it felt really

shameful. Then we had to scrub the passageway. I

thought to myself, ‘You can still move.’ It felt

strange to be alive. The Nissan Agriculture and

Forestry branch manager was sitting down in the

passageway with dressings on his hand and head as

a result of the injuries he got while being kicked. He

was probably resting after receiving medical

treatment and, being envious, I asked him to hit me

in a part of my body blood was coming from. Soon

we had our second break and I sat down in the

passageway for about thirty minutes.

The tiredness I had experienced up to now hit me

all at once and I became drowsy. Even if I pinched

myself, my nerves were paralysed and I felt nothing,

just like a stone. I could just sigh, why did I have to

suffer such cruelty ? Why did those who lost the war

have to be punished ? For the first time in my life I

was in a living hell. A sailor appeared and asked me

in Malay, “What do you lot eat ?” Up till now we had

been treated wretchedly like animals and to be

spoken to suddenly in a humane way made us

suspicious. We were all cautious and didn’t reply.

Then someone said in Malay, “Telemakashi”

[Thank you]. In the end they handed us some hard

biscuits which we ate ravenously. After we had

finished eating, we were given one cigarette each

and for the first time a look of relief came upon

everyone’s face.

There was a group of sailors who handed out

rough treatment and a ‘friendly’ group, and this slave

ship arranged things very systematically. After our

thirty‒minute break, the previous group who had

handled us roughly came storming back and the

violence started once again. Because I didn’ t

scream, no matter how much I was hit, the

treatment gradually became harsher. I thought to

myself, no matter what happens I won’t cry out.

# Memories of the Labuan Island internment

# camp for war criminals

The MP (military policeman) who came on board

our slave ship took a look at our mud‒caked clothes

and vacant expressions and said, “If any of you have

been bullied while in transit, tell me.” Nobody

answered because, once group violence is over and

done with, there’s no point in arguing about it. The

MP gave orders to disembark and left. The harbour

on Labuan Island was narrow at the jetty and we

were climbing up the rope ladder attached to the

side of the third ship. As we did so, they began

kicking us from above and hurling our caps about.

We finally crawled up on board, but now the sailors

were lined up in two rows and, as we passed

between them, they kicked us to the ground as if we

were footballs. On the way up the next rope ladder I

was kicked by leather boots, so I was anxious to pass

through the crew quickly. At last I climbed down

onto the jetty. There were three MPs and they told

me to get on a truck. I didn’t have the strength to

climb up into it myself, but my war pals pushed me

up onto a seat. The senior warrant officer and the

Nissan Agriculture and Forestry branch manager

were sighing, their eyes shiny with tears.

From the truck I saw pisang [fried banana]

hanging from the front of a street stall. During the

war I had made two short visits to Labuan Island.

Next to the customs house there was a Kempeitai

station, and when I passed through it Sergeant

Shinohara would treat us to mountain and marine

delicacies in the drawing room overlooking the sea.

The town brought back memories of skillful haircuts

given by overseas Chinese and ear cleaning that sent

you to sleep. I heard that Labuan Island had

witnessed honourable deaths, and this might be the

place where we, too, were to die. Surviving any

longer seemed difficult for the four remaining

soldiers of the Keijo [Seoul] Kempeitai who had

come to Borneo. After a thirty‒minute ride in

separate trucks we arrived at the Labuan

Internment Camp for Japanese War Criminals.

Through the two‒layered barbed wire fence I could教 育 学 論 究 第 12 号 2 0 2 034make out five tent pavilions. A sentry at the

entrance glared at me as I went inside. I could see

the face of Captain Kuroshima among those who had

previously arrived from Sandakan prisoner‒of‒war

camp.

There was a Japanese man with a commander’s

armband on his left arm. He was to assist us because

he spoke English, but before long we knew that this

was a mistake. At a time when we were mutually

craving brotherly love, some traitors were betraying

secrets to the Australian army and enforcing the

order that we salute the scum. The belongings of

the newcomers were inspected by the Australians

and suitably distributed. For some reason the

directive that my former subordinate, Sergeant

Sugino, be held as a prisoner of war was nullified, and

he died a noble death on the gallows in Rabaul. A

certain senior colonel who was facing execution, in

spite of a plea for clemency from Mrs. Keith who had

been under house arrest on Berhala Island during

the war and is well known for Three Came Home,

took his own life in Rabaul Camp. Colonel Aikawa,

the president of Miri Fuel, also committed suicide.

By the time these men left Labuan, spies were

everywhere and our people were killed because of

accusatory reports. I heard that people in Jesselton

waiting to be sent back to Japan knew of these

reports and that someone on board the repatriation

ship Katsuragi had been summoned and cross‒

examined. Furthermore, I heard that someone

registered as coming from Shizuoka went around

swindling bereaved family members of the ‘Yaezu

Fleet’ once he returned to Japan, and this became a

police matter. On the second and third day after we

entered the camp, the Australians took photographs

of us and enquired about our personal details. While

the MPs were guarding us there was hardly any

abuse, but when the regular units took over guard

duty they would come and attack the camp at night.

In addition to acts of looting and violence, they would

knock down the tents before withdrawing. If you

went to the toilet during the night and gave a bad

salute, they made you run fast many times round the

camp. Every day we were recruited for labour and

assigned work outside the camp and there were both

difficult and easy jobs, as well as work for the MPs

and work levelling the ground of the sports field.

# Memories of the miscellaneous chores

# done for the Australian MPs

When we were lined up for work detail, a

non‒commissioned MP officer came and told us

Kempeitai to step forward. I was standing nearby so

I was pulled out. They would probably exploit us, I

thought, but with the regular troops it was to a

different degree, so I didn’t think it would be like the

harsh treatment we suffered on the slave ship.

However, that they were designating Kempeitai

soldiers was suspicious. We went out through the

gate and were loaded onto two tractor jeeps. As we

climbed aboard, native children pelted us with

stones. The jeep with the Japanese soldiers who

hadn’t been accused of war crimes started to move

off. We noticed them waving at us and calling out,

“Keep up the good work.” They probably knew who

we were because of the numbers we had on the side

of our caps and because these same soldiers were

assigned heavy labour in the camp too. We arrived

at what appeared to be the headquarters of the

military police. A lieutenant came out of the office

and the twelve of us were handed shovels and

trowels as he assigned us to clean the ditches.

Inside the camp off‒duty soldiers were lying

down. Their faces all looked the same, like the

sailors on the slave ship. We were all working

silently. There was one guard but he didn’ t act

violently towards us or even say “Kammon.” A mate

next to me said, “Hey ! These MPs are better than I

thought. I wouldn’t mind doing this every day if this

is what it’s like.” We would signal to each other, and

only when the MP came over to us did we work

seriously. The knack was to know how much you

could rest. If you were called to do odd jobs, they

rewarded you with a cigarette, and the time spent

cleaning the muddy ditches passed quickly. The

midday meal I had brought with me consisted of a

packet of biscuits, but I was given half a tin ofAt the Mercy of the Enemy : the Record of a Japanese War Criminal35sardines and some coffee by the MPs’ cook.

It was the sort of humane treatment I had never

anticipated. The camp was brutal but the work

outside was OK, I thought. After lunch the cook

ordered me to cut a metal drum in half. The noise I

made cutting it up with a hammer and chisel was

loud, and there were yells of complaint from the

soldiers in the camp trying to sleep. I conveyed this

fact through gestures to the cook who got angry and

went to protest. He came back grumbling to himself,

however, led me off into the jungle and told me to do

the work there. Rolling the drum, I went to a spot

where I couldn’t be observed and settled into

position. For about an hour the sound of the chisel

striking the drum resounded through the jungle.

When I had finally finished cutting the drum, I rolled

it back to the cook. “OK,” he said and I was

unexpectedly rewarded with a pack of Koua [Asian

Development] cigarettes. I went back to my pals

and gave them each a cigarette. They seemed

content with their first army cigarette in a long time.

When the afternoon’s work was done, we went back

by jeep to the camp. Such work continued for about

twenty days.

# Memories of how we were half killed

# levelling the ground for the sports field

Work given to us Kempeitai was labourers’ work

but, compared with the slave ship it was as different

as heaven from hell. The next job assigned to us was

levelling the ground for the sports field. After

breakfast we lined up in two rows waiting for work.

All the troops coming through the main gate were

rough guys with automatic rifles slung over their

shoulders. The guy next to me said, “There’s that

fellow from the slave ship.” Well, we won’ t be

getting back from work scot‒free today, I thought.

The person in charge of the work explained that, for

the time being, all of us would be working on the

sports field.

The troops from Tawau, in particular, sent shivers

down my spine. There were five trucks waiting for

us when we went out through the gate, and

somehow the atmosphere was bad. There was a roll

call assigning us to each truck and, as we got on

board, they called in a loud voice for the latecomers

to hurry up. The trucks set off with five guards in

each truck and stopped in front of a vast sports field.

At the same time a voice called out, “Kammon !” and

we jumped down from the trucks. After another roll

call the guards were allotted a number of men each

and I went to the middle of the field carrying a

shovel.

It was so hot that I had to take off my jacket. All of

a sudden, a guard pointed at a wheelbarrow and

struck me painfully on the backside. I suppose I was

meant to transport soil in the barrow but there was

no interpreter, unfortunately, so I wasn’t sure what

to do. Just then, they called out names looking for

someone. Sergeant Major Sugino (from Sandakan

prisoner‒of‒war camp) and Captain Murakami (the

company commander in the Jesselton district) were

both in my group. From this point things became

really serious. Five or six Australian troops

approached carrying heavy sticks. Sugino and

Murakami were each ordered to fill a drum with soil

and run with it on their shoulders. They eventually

filled the drums up with soil and, limping as they

went, started to run with them. After being kicked

to the ground, they were subjected from above to

flying kicks to the belly and back with army boots,

and soon they were groaning in agony. It was so

cruel I couldn’t look. At length, the two men,

groaning pathetically, collapsed with exhaustion,

unable to stand up anymore. Even a robust

physique would be at the utmost limits of life if

kicked to such a degree. Later, Sergeant Major

Sugino, accused by some traitor, was to disappear

like the dew in Rabaul. At last the punishment of the

two men was halted and three of the troops left

apparently satisfied. The three remaining now

came towards us. I was running, pushing the

wheelbarrow, but one of them put his leg out and I

tripped head over heels. I was kicked with army

boots and, rising quickly to my feet, was struck with

sticks. There was nothing I could do. Summoning

all my strength, I started working like crazy but the教 育 学 論 究 第 12 号 2 0 2 036cruel sticks kept coming. My whole body was

covered in cuts and I tried, unsuccessfully, to stand

up. All around I could hear screams. Finally, a

whistle signalled a stop in the work. The next thing I

noticed, I was sitting down hungry and exhausted.

I heard from Captain Murakami at the midday

meal that, as company commander of a small army

force, he had fought bravely and resolutely against

the Australians when these had come ashore at

Jesselton. Unaware that the war had ended, this

force had put up resistance in a jungle campaign

until mid‒October. They were a force to be looked

up to. As soldiers they were prepared to fight to the

death without surrender. In the postwar period this

noble spirit of fighting for one’ s country was not

acknowledged. He was subjected to retaliatory

measures by the Australian army who saw him as

their bitter enemy and singled him out arbitrarily for

ill‒treatment. He ended up in Changi before

returning to Japan in February 1947.

# Memories of the POW camp on Jurong

# Island, Singapore

We were transferred from Labuan Island to

Changi, Singapore, where, on two meals a day, we

battled with hunger. We suffered mental anguish

from interrogations and trials, and many of my

fellow countrymen were executed or sentenced to

fixed terms of imprisonment. However, most of us

from the Tawau Kempeitai were moved from

Changi Jail to Jurong Camp on December 21st, 1946.

The ones who went to Jurong at this time were those

who had been cleared of war crimes and those from

ordinary units waiting for a chance to return to

Japan. With each unit in their lodgings, there was a

peaceful atmosphere to camp life. I was involved in

demobilization duties and, during the day, was busy

drawing up a register of names for embarkation and

putting together documents. Because of a

breakdown in the repatriation ship’ s engine shaft,

though, our shipping out was postponed and we

were called back to Changi. The following day was

New Year’s Day and I wanted at least something in

the shape of a rice cake, but there was nothing.

Then I suddenly remembered that I could make rice

cakes out of tapioca tubers.

There were no tapioca plants inside the

compound. The surrounding area was secured with

barbed wire entanglements and the vigilance was

unrelenting. I decided to get outside somehow, but

there was a danger of the natives kicking up a fuss

and shooting me dead. It was risking death to dig for

tubers but three spirited young men supported my

idea. Another two decided to wait till sunset to pick

rambutan [a tropical fruit].

It was an adventure but everyone’s expectations

were raised. We would need full gunnysacks.

Lightly dressed and with our legs wrapped in

puttees for support, we set out from the camp. In

the moonlit night the road was well lit and conditions

were favourable. During the daytime I had scouted

the neighbouring terrain. Just after we had passed

under the first barbed wire fence and were lying flat

on the ground, a soldier approached on patrol ten

metres ahead of us to our left. He came closer

holding his automatic rifle. Prostrating ourselves,

we waited for him to pass by. We made sure he was

out of sight and then advanced. I got through the

second barbed wire fence and urged the others to

follow. At five‒metre intervals we pushed our way

through the long grass, crossed over the road and

reached the highway.

We could see the lights from a native village

across the road. There were voices so I told the

others that each of us should advance as far as the

hill and I rushed out first. We all ran at full speed to

the hill, then lay flat on the ground to assess the

situation. We entered a wild tapioca field, pulled up

the tubers by their roots and put them in our

gunnysacks. In the wild the tubers are small so we

went into another field closer to the houses to steal

the tapioca. A dog started barking and danger was

closing in on us. We pulled up the tubers faster,

sparing little time to check what was going on

around us. The sound we made pulling got louder

but my sack was only four‒fifths full. Just then, a

mate below me said, “Someone’s coming from theAt the Mercy of the Enemy : the Record of a Japanese War Criminal37road” so I hurriedly hoisted my sack onto my

shoulders and set off down the slope. Over in the

village they seemed to have noticed us and were

making a noise. A man in a white shirt was waving

his hands in the air. The fellow behind me wasn’t

carrying anything, and when I asked him what had

happened, he said, “The full sack was too heavy. I

couldn’t run.” I hurried back to get the sack and he

was right—it was full. I used all my strength to lift it

onto my shoulders and ran down the hill. I crossed

over the road and ran into the forest where I found

my three comrades hiding.

Someone was coming towards us and, looking

closely, I saw it was a Japanese soldier. “Hey !” I

called out. This startled him and he made as if to run

away but then sat down. “I can’t do it today,” he said.

“I’ve just been chased after escaping.” He informed

us that the sentry on patrol had just passed so we

were all right for thirty minutes. After a rest, we

crossed the road and ran to the barbed wire fences.

The four of us eventually got back safely to the

camp. All the inmates came out to welcome us and

flattered us saying our ‘distinguished service’

deserved a medal. After that, we all split up into

groups, some building a fire, others grating the

tubers with tin cans, and in about two hours the New

Year rice cakes were ready to eat, reminding us of

the rice cake pounding in our home towns.

# Final thoughts

The treatment accorded Japanese prisoners of

war in Allied POW camps is generally held to have

been in line with the provisions laid down in the 1929

Geneva Convention (MacKenzie, 1994) —for

example, food, accommodation and clothing to be on

an equal footing to that provided to the soldiers that

captured them, prisoners to be treated humanely at

all times and protected from acts of violence or

reprisals. That being the case, how is it possible to

account for the bullying and physical abuse, the

beatings, kicking and half‒drowning described by

Misaka in his ‘Notes’ ? The end of hostilities in

August 1945 and the subsequent freeing of Allied

captives might have been one factor. As MacKenzie

(1994) points out : “(T)he end of fears concerning

retaliation against Allied POWs meant that while the

treatment of those Japanese prisoners taken earlier

in the war remained the same, conditions among the

huge number of surrendered personnel taken after

August 1945 were often below Geneva Convention

standards” (p. 158). Exemplifying this, asserts

MacKenzie, was “a certain amount of vindictive

callousness among Allied troops” (1994:158).

Indeed, the Australia‒Japan Research Project

(AJRP) has found that Australian attitudes towards

the Japanese hardened in the period soon after the

end of the war, when the trials of former Japanese

military for war crimes were widely publicized.

Among the AJRP interviews of Australian veterans,

for instance, we find this exchange with a former

sergeant in the Australian Military Forces, Jack

Flanagan :

Interviewer : With the atrocities that were then

known to have happened and many men would

have good reason to feel that they wanted to

revenge themselves against the Japanese. Did

you see Japanese who were knocked about in that

situation ?

Flanagan : Oh, yes, yes. That is what I say. We

hear a lot about what they did to us but we were in

the same boat. Perhaps not as bad but it was

there, that, this is the enemy, let’s destroy him. It

was there all of the time.

[From The Australia‒Japan Research

Project, 1996]

Another factor militating against Misaka and his

companions during their incarceration was that they

were not officially classed as prisoners of

war—which, under the Geneva Convention, would

have protected them from being pressed into hard

labour — but as Japanese Surrendered Personnel, a

status first proposed by Japan’s Imperial

Headquarters after the August 15th surrender to

encourage Japanese servicemen to submit to Allied

control (Connor, 2010).教 育 学 論 究 第 12 号 2 0 2 038What attitudes can we detect in Misaka’s

memoir ? Is there irony in his use of the term ‘war

criminal’ ? Or is there perhaps an innate pride in

being given this label (he is officially recorded as

War Criminal number 1011 in the National Archives

of Australia), a pride stemming from former

Japanese military prowess ? Nowhere in the ‘Notes’

do we find an intimation that the suffering that he

endured was in any way deserved, that he was being

punished by fate for past misdemeanours. Instead,

the predominant tone is one of victimhood, even

self‒pity, which is understandable when we

remember that his intended readership was fellow

Kempeitai veterans, a group in the habit of regarding

themselves as victims of ‘victors’ justice’ (see

Shimer and Hobbs, 2010, pp. 76ff). By describing

the humiliation and cruelties to which he was

subjected, the ‘Notes’ became a ‘form of retaliation’.

Perhaps they were also a form of therapy (Towle,

2000), though Misaka makes clear that the

memories of what he endured in captivity never

faded. Among these dark memories we also find

examples of humane behaviour by the adversary,

random acts of kindness that Misaka finds totally

unexpected. The general thrust of his recollections,

however, must surely lead us to abandon the

oversimplified dichotomy of good versus evil, the

civilised versus the barbaric. Modern warfare can

have a dehumanizing effect on all who are called

upon to engage in it. The Singaporean educator,

Elizabeth Choy, recognised this. Despite being

subjected to barbaric forms of torture while under

interrogation by the Kempeitai in October 1942, she

was adamant, once the war ended, that the men

responsible for her terrifying ordeal should not be

put to death. “If not for war,” she said, “they would

be just like me. They would be at home with their

family, doing just ordinary things and peaceful work.

Let us pray that there will be no more war” (quoted

in Felton, 2012:94).

Looking back, at the end of the twentieth century,

on the history of total war, the social historian Eric

Hobsbawm painted a bleak picture of the effect that

war has had upon mankind : “(W) e have become

relatively insensitive to atrocity ; our voice of moral

outrage has been silenced and we have been

‘brainwashed into accepting barbarity’ ” (quoted in

Beaumont, 1996:277). The treatment of prisoners

of war since 1945—for example, in Korea, Vietnam,

Iraq and the former Yugoslavia—and the notoriety

attached to cases of prisoner abuse at Bagram, Abu

Ghraib and Guantanamo bear witness to a gradual

shift away from a humanitarian standpoint to one

that views the captive as an embodiment of an alien

ideology—the ‘other’—incapable of arousing

empathy. The vigilance and scrutiny of non‒

governmental organisations such as Amnesty

International and Human Rights Watch remain,

unfortunately, as essential today as they have ever

been.At the Mercy of the Enemy : the Record of a Japanese War Criminal39The author would like to express his sincere thanks to
