Mladic Arrives in The Hague
---------------------------

*   May 31, 2011

THE HAGUE — Ratko Mladic, the long-fugitive international war crimes suspect captured last week, arrived here Tuesday to face trial after judges in Serbia ruled against the appeal of his extradition.

The authorities in Belgrade, Serbia’s capital, signed the papers to hand him over to the tribunal more swiftly than expected as soon as judges had rejected his appeal, which argued that he was physically and mentally unfit to stand trial before the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague. Within hours, he was bundled onto a waiting plane for the Netherlands.

Mr. Mladic’s transfer begins the final chapter in a nearly 16-year international effort to find him and bring him to account after he was accused of crimes against humanity, war crimes and genocide during the Balkan wars of the 1990s, including the massacre of some 8,000 unarmed Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in July 1995.
