Tajikistan debates ban on Arabic names as part of crackdown on Islam

Authorities prepare list of acceptable alternatives for parents amid warning that ‘unsuitable’ names will not be registered. [Eurasianet.org reports](http://www.eurasianet.org/node/73301)

Tajikistan is debating legislation to ban Arabic names as part of an ongoing campaign against Islam that has seen men being [forced to shave their beards](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/isis-tajik-police-forced-muslims-shave-their-beards-fight-against-extremism-1498499) and women in [hijab being labelled prostitutes](http://www.eurasianet.org/node/72816).

[How Isis is recruiting migrant workers in Moscow to join the fighting in Syria Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/05/isis-russia-syria-islamic-extremism)

The president, Emomali Rahmon, ordered his rubber-stamp parliament to consider a bill that would forbid the registration of names considered too Arabic, an official in the Justice Ministry’s department of civil registry [told Interfax](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/08/tajikistan-islam-arabic-names-crackdown).

“After the adoption of these regulations, the registry offices will not register names that are incorrect or alien to the local culture, including names denoting objects, flora and fauna, as well as names of Arabic origin,” Jaloliddin Rahimov was quoted as saying.

Though the law would only apply to babies born after it is passed, some parliamentarians are reportedly demanding that existing names that are Arab-sounding should be changed to Tajik-sounding ones.

If parents cannot come up with a name on their own, the Justice Ministry is preparing a list of recommended ones.

Islam is by far the largest religion in [Tajikistan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/tajikistan), practised by about 98% of the population. Religious observance has been on the rise recently, much to the dismay of the secular government which cites fears that the country’s disenfranchised and poverty stricken villages are becoming recruiting grounds for militants.

As well as clamping down on beards and hijab, authorities have closed independent mosques and [encouraged imams to use](http://www.eurasianet.org/node/72311) their sermons to praise the president. Human rights groups say Muslims are regularly arrested on trumped-up charges that conflate faith with terrorism.

But the latest measure casts such a wide net that, if taken literally, it could catch the country’s biggest fish. The president’s name, Emomali, is a version of Imam Ali, Prophet Muhammad’s son-in-law, the fourth caliph for Sunnis and the first imam for Shia Muslims.

At this unsettling time
-----------------------

We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could spare 37 seconds to support our most important fundraising appeal of the year.

In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year on from his second victory, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one.

From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced.

While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts.

While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel.

**Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less.**

**But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, it means we’ll show you fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you.**

In the Germany I grew up in it was also restricted what names you could give children, and nobody died.

And this is yet another quarrel among equals.
