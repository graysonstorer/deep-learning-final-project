“My three-year-old daughter Yueyun was killed by Japanese army. I participated in the burial of dead bodies of the Hui people.”

Before the Japanese army entered Nanjing, my family lived in the Libai Temple at Ji’e lane. There were nine people in the family, including our parents, the couple of me and my wife, and five children. Both my father and I were imams of Islam.

At the end of October of lunar calendar in 1937, because of the tense situation, we moved to the refugee shelter at No. 28 of Doucai Bridge and lived on the second floor. On November 12, Japanese soldiers broke into the city. They would set fire, kill and rob as soon as they entered any house. One day, three Japanese soldiers came to the Doucai Bridge, and one of them broke into my house. Li kuofei, a 28-year-old woman who lived in the back room of our house, saw the Japanese soldiers come in, she wittily sat beside us, holding our three-year-old daughter, Yueyun, to show that she was already a mother of children. But it didn’t work for the Japanese soldiers. They saw she was a beautiful woman. So they grabbed my poor daughter out of her arms, and threw her to the corner, then forced Kuofei to the back room and raped her. My child Yue Yun was thrown to be half alive with her eyes turned upward, she died within two days. Later Kuofei and her mother hid themselves into the refugee camp of Ginling University. But the Japanese soldiers continued to find them. They felt helpless and jumped into the pond of Ginling University. Fortunately, they were rescued.

In the first month of lunar calendar in 1938, many relatives of the victims of Hui nationality came together to ask me and some imams like Ma Changfa, Wang Shouren, Ge Changfa, Ma Zihe and Zhang Zihui, and my father Shen Decheng to come out to bury the bodies. I went to Sun Shurong (Hui nationality), who was in charge of the security maintenance organization at that time, asking for help. We made the armbands as identification for our own, forming a burial team for Hui people, and began to collect and bury the bodies of Hui compatriots.

The first body we collected was Father Zhang, who was in his sixties and was the caretaker of the mosque in Ji’e lane. When he died, he maintained the position of lying with face down. Because of long exposure, the body already began to rot. According to religious practice, the body should be washed before burial in the ground. To clean a corpse, it’s needed to take off the clothes. But clothes on many bodies were already unable to take off, we had to use scissors to cut them down. And the earth burial was not as carefully as usual. At that time, several bold and strong people were responsible for collecting the body, several other weak people and I were holding the ceremony.

The burial site was mainly located in Hongtu Bridge (now Guangzhou Road), Dongguashi (now Nanjing Normal University), places like Wutai Mountain, Hongtu Bridge and Dongguashi were buried with the most bodies, and Jiuhua Mountain.

We had been involved in burying bodies for more than three months. During that time, people came to us almost every day, asking us to collect bodies. At least there were two or three bodies a day, at most there were seven or eight, and usually there were four or five. Sometimes the bodies were too many to collect and bury. Then we divided them into two groups. At first, we would register the body we buried one by one, but later it was impossible to register in this way and we changed to register in batches. No less than a total of 400 bodies were collected and buried, and all of them were Hui people killed around the mosque in Ji’e lane. Among the buried bodies, there were men, women and children. A mother and son fell to the ground after being killed. The boy was only seven or eight years old, with his head turning to the mother. The scene was too miserable. At that time, countless bodies spread in disorder in the Nanjing city. Wulong pond was covered with bodies, and the water was almost invisible, and the color of the water became red. At the foot of Jiuhua Mountain was also piledlane with bodies that cannot be buried in time. Now, whenever I recalled the scene of those days and thought of those places, I would feel nervous and creepy.
