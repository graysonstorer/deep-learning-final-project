Utøya island shooting victims return to scene of Breivik's killing spree

Norwegian investigators accompany about 500 people to see where rightwing extremist killed 69 at summer camp

Survivors of the gun attack which claimed the lives of 69 people last month on the Norwegian island of Utøya revisited the massacre scene on Friday in the company of families and friends of those who died.

About 500 people visited the island in light rain. As many as 1,500 people are expected to visit over the weekend, including the Norwegian prime minister, Jens Stoltenberg.

Emilie Bersaas, 19, who survived the attack on the island youth camp, told Sky News she has avoided thinking about the man who admitted responsibility for the attacks, rightwing extremist Anders Behring Breivik: "Mostly I don't want to because I don't think he deserves my thoughts... I would rather that my friends who are not here today get my thoughts."

Norway's general director of health, Bjørn-Inge Larsen, said he hoped the visits would help relatives with their grieving: "In the long run, we know that seeing the scene of where these murders were taking place is actually helpful."

The bereaved visitors are being told the exact circumstances in which their loved ones died by investigators. Psychologists and clergymen are on the island to offer support.

As the visits got under way on Friday, the Norwegian prosecutor said a rightwing English blogger named in Breivik's rambling "manifesto" would be questioned next week as part of the investigation.

Paal-Fredrik Hjort Kraby told the Associated Press that Paul Ray, who used go by the name of Paul Sonato, was coming to Norway voluntarily.

"He is mentioned as a mentor in Breivik's manifesto, so it's natural to question him about that," said Kraby.

Ray, who lives in Malta, said last month he never had any dealings with Breivik and condemned the massacre.

Kraby said: "Ray is concerned about clearing his name when it comes to being a mentor."

Breivik's 1,500-page document posted online before the attacks said his action was an attempt at cultural revolution. He claimed to be a member of the Knights Templar, which he portrayed as a network of modern-day crusaders who would launch a revolution against a [Europe](https://www.theguardian.com/world/europe-news) spoiled by Muslim immigration.

On Friday, a court extended by four weeks the detention in solitary confinement of Breivik, who confessed to killing 69 people in the shooting rampage and eight people in a bombing in Oslo.

The Oslo district court ruled he must be kept in complete isolation because of fears he would tamper with evidence and contact possible accomplices.

Judge Hugo Abelseth acknowledged Breivik had described his isolation as "boring and monotonous, and a sadistic torture method," but said he must nonetheless spend at least four more weeks there.

Survivors and victims, who were not allowed into the court hearing, were represented by lawyers. Breivik could face a 21-year prison sentence if found guilty of terrorism charges, but that could be extended indefinitely if he is still deemed to pose a threat to the public.

On Sunday, a month of mourning for the 77 people who died in the attacks will end with a national memorial service at Oslo Spektrum arena.

At this unsettling time
-----------------------

We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could spare 37 seconds to support our most important fundraising appeal of the year.

In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year on from his second victory, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one.

From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced.

While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts.

While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel.

**Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less.**

**But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, it means we’ll show you fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you.**
