From reviews of the first edition:

'A brilliant and bitter history'.Richard Holmes,The Times

'an author who aspires to the highest standards of scholarship and prose...the last word on its subject and likely to remain so for many years'.Sunday Telegraph

'a magnificent narrative based on thorough research and careful judgment'.The Guardian

'Mr.St Clair looks at the war as it involved the philhellenes...whose names are now associated with the myth of the glorious fight for Greek Freedom...His diligent and wide research has paid a rich dividend.He has added to the book's value by including many portraits,paintings,and maps'.The Economist

'tells their melancholy story with sardonic relish and lucid scholarship.Like his previous book on'Lord Elgin and the Marbles'it is a brilliant and elegant performance that puts all previous work in the shade'.CM.Woodhouse,The Observer

One can pick a hero figure out of almost page of a classical dictionary,and without this magic appeal of antiquity it is improbable that Greece would have obtained independence so early in the century.As William St Clair points out in"That Greece Might Still Be Free"the bloody revolt of the Serbs against the Turks in 1808 aroused no interest in Western Europe.Yet when the Greek revolution broke out in 1821 Philhellene foreigners volunteered by the shipload to join a non-existent Greek army'.Daily Telegraph

'Mr.St Clair's study of the philhellenes in the Greek revolution is noteworthy for its sprightly narrative and vivid biographical sketches...the implausible yet fascinating activities of assorted opportunists,idealists,impostors,adventurers,and secret agents.Their collective impact on the course of events was by no means negligible and so far as the Western public was concerned,they were involved in a cause that roused deeper passions than any similar event until the Spanish Civil War more than a century later'.American Historical Review

'he hates the sentimental bosh and unreal idealism which drew so many young men to needless and squalid deaths;which dresses up bandit chiefs in heroic costumes.His heroes are the Americans who,at the end of the war,brought relief to the starving Greek population'.Irish Independent

That Greece Might Still be Free The Philhellenes in the War of Independence
===========================================================================

by[William St. Clair](https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22William+St.+Clair%22)

Publication date[2008](https://archive.org/search.php?query=date:2008)Topics[bub_upload](https://archive.org/search.php?query=subject%3A%22bub_upload%22)Publisher Open Book Publishers Collection[europeanlibraries](https://archive.org/details/europeanlibraries)Book from the collections of unknown library Language[English](https://archive.org/search.php?query=%28language%3Aeng+OR+language%3A%22English%22%29)Item Size 1.3G 

When in 1821, the Greeks rose in violent revolution against the rule of the Ottoman Turks, waves of sympathy spread across Western Europe and the United States. More than a thousand volunteers set out to fight for the cause. The Philhellenes, whether they set out to recreate the Athens of Pericles, start a new crusade, or make money out of a war, all felt that Greece had unique claim on the sympathy of the world. As Byron wrote, 'I dreamed that Greece might Still be Free'; and he died at Missolonghi trying to translate that dream into reality. William St Clair's meticulously researched and highly readable account of their aspirations and experiences was hailed as definitive when it was first published. Long out of print, it remains the standard account of the Philhellenic movement and essential reading for any students of the Greek War of Independence, Byron, and European Romanticism. Its relevance to more modern ethnic and religious conflicts is becoming increasingly appreciated by scholars worldwide. This new and revised edition includes a new Introduction by Roderick Beaton, an updated Bibliography and many new illustrations.
