For most people, four to five hours a sleep every night may prove to have destructive consequences. But for U.S. President Donald Trump, it seems to be working out.

![Image 19: A 1x1 image, likely be a tacker probe](https://d21y75miwcfqoq.cloudfront.net/70c8fc80)
On Tuesday, Trump’s White House doctor said the president gets a minimal amount of shut-eye.

**READ MORE: [White House doctors gives Trump medical, cognitive test](https://globalnews.ca/news/3968959/trumps-medical-test-montreal-cognitive-assessment/)**

“I would say he sleeps four to five hours a night,”Trump’s physician, Navy doctor Ronny Jackson, told reporters. “He’s probably been like that his whole life. He’s just one of those people who just does not require a lot of sleep.”

Researchers claim that the average person needs around [seven to eight](https://sleepfoundation.org/excessivesleepiness/content/how-much-sleep-do-we-really-need-0) hours of sleep every day.

But a small percentage of the population (one to three per cent) can function with much less. There’s a scientific name for them: [short sleepers](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703712504576242701752957910?mod=wsj_share_twitter)— and Trump could be one.

2:16 Did you know that sleeping naked is better for your health?

Trump has previously said he gets minimal sleep. In an interview with Fox News’ _The O’Reilly Factor_ last year, he said he typically goes to bed at midnight or 1 a.m. and wakes up at 5 a.m. to eat, read newspapers and watch television.

Short sleepers can get by with less than six hours of sleep and feel alert and refreshed, [according to researchers](http://www.sleepeducation.org/sleep-disorders-by-category/insomnias/short-sleeper). Trump isn’t the only famous person who seems to get by with less sleep.
