Divided Court Eliminates Trump’s Half-Billion-Dollar Fine in Fraud Case
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

New York appeals judges said that the judgment was excessive, but agreed to uphold the case so the appeal could continue.

A divided New York appeals court on Thursday threw out a half-billion-dollar judgment against President Trump, eliminating an enormous financial burden while preserving the fraud case against him, a remarkable turn in [the battle between the president and one of his fiercest foes](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/08/nyregion/letitia-james-subpoena-trump-doj.html).

One of the judges, Peter Moulton, concluded that while Mr. Trump had done harm in inflating the value of his properties and other assets, “it was not the cataclysmic harm that can justify a nearly half-billion-dollar award to the state.”

But the decision to eliminate the penalty was a rare point of agreement among the five-judge panel, whose lengthy ruling otherwise reflected deep discord.

While the court effectively upheld the fraud judgment against the president, several of the justices raised major questions about the case, which was decided by a state trial judge last year. A primary goal of their decision was to allow Mr. Trump to move to New York’s highest court, giving him another opportunity to challenge the finding that he was a fraudster.

Despite the complexities, Thursday’s ruling handed Mr. Trump a financial victory and a measure of legal validation. It represented a setback for New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, who is one of the president’s foremost adversaries and a target of his [wide-ranging retribution campaign](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/11/nyregion/trump-james-ny-attorney-general-investigation.html). The case had been a career-defining victory after she campaigned promising to bring Mr. Trump to justice.

Mr. Trump responded on social media Thursday, declaring victory and praising the court for having “the Courage to throw out this unlawful and disgraceful Decision.” He added that the case had been “a Political Witch Hunt, in a business sense.”
