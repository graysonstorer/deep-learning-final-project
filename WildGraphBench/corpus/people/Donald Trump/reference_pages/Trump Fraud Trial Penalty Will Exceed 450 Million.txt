The ruling in Donald J. Trump’s civil fraud case could cost him all his available cash. The judge said that the former president’s “complete lack of contrition” bordered on pathological.

A New York judge on Friday handed Donald J. Trump a crushing defeat in his [civil fraud case](https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/trump-attorney-general-ny-inquiry), finding the former president liable for conspiring to manipulate his net worth and ordering him to pay a penalty of nearly $355 million plus interest that [could wipe out his entire stockpile of cash](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/nyregion/trumps-fraud-ruling-finances.html).

[The decision](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/02/16/nyregion/trump-fraud-engoron-decision-annotated.html) by [Justice Arthur F. Engoron](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/14/nyregion/trump-fraud-trial-judge.html) caps a chaotic, yearslong case in which [New York’s attorney general](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/05/nyregion/letitia-james-trump-fine.html) put Mr. Trump’s fantastical claims of wealth on trial. With no jury, the power was in Justice Engoron’s hands alone, and he came down hard: The judge delivered a sweeping array of punishments that threatens the former president’s business empire [as he simultaneously contends](https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-investigations-civil-criminal.html) with four criminal prosecutions and seeks to regain the White House.

[Justice Engoron](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/14/nyregion/trump-fraud-trial-judge.html) barred Mr. Trump for three years from serving in top roles at any New York company, including portions of his own Trump Organization. He also imposed a two-year ban on the former president’s adult sons and ordered that they pay more than $4 million each. One of them, Eric Trump, is the company’s de facto chief executive, and the ruling throws into doubt whether any member of the family can run the business in the near term.

The judge also ordered that they pay substantial interest, pushing the penalty for the former president to $450 million, according to the attorney general, Letitia James.

In his unconventional style, Justice Engoron criticized Mr. Trump and the other defendants for refusing to admit wrongdoing for years. “Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” he said.

He noted that Mr. Trump had not committed violent crimes and also conceded that “Donald Trump is not Bernard Madoff.” Still, he wrote, “defendants are incapable of admitting the error of their ways.”
