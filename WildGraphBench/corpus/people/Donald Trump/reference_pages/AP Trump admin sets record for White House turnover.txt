President Trump’s White House is setting records for staff turnover, according to an analysis by[The Associated Press](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-white-house-sets-turnover-records-analysis-shows-n888396).

The news outlet reports a turnover rate of 37 percent at the White House in the 12-month period ending June 30, 2018. The analysis found that 141 staffers who worked in the White House as of June 30, 2017, have left their jobs, and 138 employees have been hired since then.

The figures do not take into account employees who arrived and exited during that yearlong period, nor does it include those who departed before the end of June 2017. For example, former White House communications director [Anthony Scaramucci,](https://thehill.com/people/anthony-scaramucci/) who lasted less than two weeks in that role, is not included in the analysis.

Additionally, the AP found that 61 percent of Trump’s most senior aides have left their positions. Former President Clinton is the only commander in chief in the last five administrations to have a somewhat similar senior staff turnover rate,at 42 percent.

The AP also noted that the White House’s annual salary disclosure to Congress shows that more than 170 staffers received raises during that 12-month period.
