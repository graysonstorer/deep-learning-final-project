President Trump has a history of attacking women by mocking their bodily functions, demeaning their looks or comparing them to animals.

WASHINGTON — President Trump referred to the pornographic film actress Stephanie Clifford as “Horseface” in [a tweet on Tuesday](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1052213711295930368), adding her to a long list of women he has attacked by demeaning their looks, mocking their bodily functions or comparing them to animals.

Mr. Trump’s verbal assault came as he gloated about a federal judge’s [decision to dismiss a defamation suit](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/admin/stormy-daniels-lawsuit-dismissed-trump.html) filed by Ms. Clifford, who is known professionally as Stormy Daniels. Ms. Clifford’s lawyer responded by calling the president “a disgusting misogynist.” Ms. Clifford — who was paid $130,000 through Mr. Trump’s former lawyer to buy her silence about sex she said she had with Mr. Trump — [replied on Twitter](https://twitter.com/StormyDaniels/status/1052224021855637505) by using the nickname “Tiny” for the president.

Mr. Trump’s tweet landed in the final days of a congressional election cycle in which Republican candidates are already struggling to woo female voters. The president’s language is unlikely to be helpful to them.

Although the president’s comment was striking about Ms. Clifford, who has graphically described Mr. Trump’s genitals in a recent memoir, it was hardly unique.

Mr. Trump has accused women of having “fat, ugly” faces and of repelling voters because of their looks. He called one woman a “crazed, crying lowlife” and said another was a “dog” who had the “face of a pig.” He said Hillary Clinton’s bathroom break during a 2015 presidential debate was “too disgusting” to talk about. He has repeatedly mocked women for being overweight.
