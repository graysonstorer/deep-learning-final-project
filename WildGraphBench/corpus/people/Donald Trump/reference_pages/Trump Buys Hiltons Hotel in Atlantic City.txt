The Trump Organization yesterday purchased the unopened Atlantic City Hilton Hotel, a 624-room structure in the gaming center's marina area where it wants to operate a casino.

The widely expected deal was announced by John Baron, a vice president in the Trump Organization, and confirmed by a Hilton spokesman.

Mr. Baron said the agreement was signed yesterday by Donald Trump, the real-estate developer, and by Barron Hilton, chairman of the Hilton Hotels Corporation.

According to Mr. Baron, Trump agreed to pay ''about $300 million'' in cash to Hilton Hotels, which spent $308 million to build the hotel but had its application to operate a casino in it rejected two months ago.

John Giovenco, Hilton's executive vice president and chief financial officer, described the payment as ''in excess of $300 million'' and said it would cover all of Hilton's building costs.

Hilton Casinos in Las Vegas

Reports of the impending sale circulating this month said the price under discussion was between $320 million and $325 million. At the time, both sides denied that final terms had been reached and said that negotiations were continuing between Mr. Trump and Mr. Giovenco .

Hilton operates two casino-hotels in Las Vegas, Nev., the Flamingo Hilton and the Las Vegas Hilton, which together accounted for 39 percent of the company's 1984 profits. It had planned to open the Atlantic City casino on May 14.

But on Feb. 28, the New Jersey Casino Commission voted to deny Hilton a license to operate a casino in the hotel. The commissioners who voted against the application cited charges that some people connected to Hilton had associated in the past with organized-crime figures.

Hilton, which denied the charges, then said that it was considering the sale of the unopened hotel while it continued to pursue the gaming license.

Yesterday, however, Mr. Giovenco said Hilton was unsure whether it would continue pursuing the license.

Mr. Hilton had declared that the company was prepared to ''demonstrate conclusively'' his company's integrity and fitness to operate a casino in New Jersey. But at the same time, he said there was an obligation to ''protect the investment interests of our company and its shareholders'' by pursuing the negotiations with Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump already is half-owner with Holiday Inns of the Trump Plaza casino hotel on the Atlantic City boardwalk.
