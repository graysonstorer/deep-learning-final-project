President-elect released statement saying he would dissolve Trump Foundation to avoid ‘even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President’

Donald Trump announced on Saturday that he will shut down his charitable foundation, a response to mounting complaints over conflicts related to the president-elect’s charitable and business interests.

In a statement released by his campaign, Trump said the Donald J Trump Foundation would be “dissolved” to avoid “even the appearance of any conflict with my role as President”.

Trump said he would continue to pursue his “strong interest in philanthropy” in other ways.

The closure of the Trump Foundation, which was [first reported](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/24/us/politics/trump-family-conflicts.html) by the New York Times, requires the approval of the New York attorney general’s office, which is currently investigating the nonprofit and [issued a cease and desist order](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/03/donald-trump-foundation-donations-new-york) to it in October.

The Donald J Trump Foundation was repeatedly the subject of controversy throughout the presidential campaign after a series of investigations by the Washington Post’s David Fahrenthold. Trump [reportedly used](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/trump-foundation-settlements-golf-course-mar-a-lago) $258,000 of the foundation’s money to pay for personal legal settlements. He [also spent charitable funds](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/oct/05/donald-trump-foundation-allegations-charity-new-york) on multiple portraits of himself and on a football helmet autographed by Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.

The foundation also made a donation to a political group supporting Florida attorney general Pam Bondi, a longtime Trump backer in violation of tax law. The president-elect has since paid $2,500 to the Internal Revenue Service over the donation.

Trump [had not donated](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-boasts-of-his-philanthropy-but-his-giving-falls-short-of-his-words/2016/10/29/b3c03106-9ac7-11e6-a0ed-ab0774c1eaa5_story.html?utm_term=.c6ac4e9e8107) to his own foundation since 2008; the nonprofit relied on donations from other Trump associates, including professional wrestling magnates Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave $5m to the Trump Foundation. [Linda McMahon](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/09/donald-trump-administration-cabinet-picks-so-far) has since been announced as Trump’s nominee to lead the Small Business Administration.

The decision also comes as Trump’s children have been under scrutiny for charitable efforts that raised questions over whether [people were paying for access](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/20/trump-children-eric-ivanka-donald-charity-selling-access) to the incoming president and his family.

A celebrity auction for a coffee date with Ivanka Trump, sponsored by Eric Trump’s charity, was called off earlier in December because donors were apparently given an attempt to curry favor with the incoming president and buy access to one of his closest advisers.

Both Eric and his brother, Don Jr, were also scheduled to appear at a reception on behalf of conservation charities over the weekend of the inauguration. The reception, which has since been canceled, [reportedly promised](http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/12/20/trump-sons-sell-access-to-president-on-inauguration-weekend/) the opportunity to meet the president-elect in exchange for $1m in donations.

These issues have come as Trump’s entire real estate business has come under scrutiny for potential conflicts of interest. In particular, Trump’s international properties have the potential to violate the emoluments clause of the constitution, which prohibits anyone holding “an office of profit or trust” from accepting “any present, emolument, office, or title, of any kind whatever, from any king, prince or foreign state”. But these conflicts also apply domestically, as the Kuwaiti government has already announced that it is shifting its annual party in February to Trump’s new hotel in Washington.

The issues [are further amplified](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/14/donald-trump-conflicts-of-interest-explainer) because the Trump Organization is a privately held corporation and the president-elect has flouted longstanding tradition in not releasing his tax returns. The result is that there is no clear way to know what assets and liabilities Trump has. It is known, though, that Trump [owes $364m](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/12/trump-deutsche-bank-conflict-loans) to Deutsche Bank.

A news conference that the president-elect promised to hold on the topic on 15 December [has since been postponed until sometime in January 2017](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/12/donald-trump-postpones-business-interests-press-conference-january).

At this unsettling time
-----------------------

We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could spare 37 seconds to support our most important fundraising appeal of the year.

In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year on from his second victory, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one.

From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced.

While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts.

While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel.

**Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less.**

**But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, it means we’ll show you fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you.**
