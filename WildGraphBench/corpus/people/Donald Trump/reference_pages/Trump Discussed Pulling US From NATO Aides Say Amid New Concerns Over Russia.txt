WASHINGTON — There are few things that President Vladimir V. Putin of [Russia](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/world/europe/russia-nato.html) desires more than the weakening of [NATO](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/14/world/europe/biden-nato-china-russia.html), the military alliance among the United States, Europe and Canada that has deterred Soviet and Russian aggression for 70 years.

Last year, President Trump suggested a move tantamount to destroying [NATO](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/18/world/europe/russia-nato.html): the withdrawal of the United States.

Senior administration officials told The New York Times that several times over the course of 2018, Mr. Trump privately said he wanted to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Current and former officials who support the alliance said they feared Mr. Trump could return to his threat as allied military spending continued to lag behind the goals the president had set.

In the days around a [tumultuous NATO summit meeting](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/12/world/europe/trump-nato-russia.html) last summer, they said, Mr. Trump told his top national security officials that he did not see the point of the military alliance, which he presented as a drain on the United States.

At the time, Mr. Trump’s national security team, including Jim Mattis, then the defense secretary, and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, scrambled to keep American strategy on track without mention of a withdrawal that would drastically reduce Washington’s influence in Europe and could embolden Russia for decades.

Now, the president’s repeatedly stated desire to withdraw from NATO is raising new worries among national security officials amid growing concern about Mr. Trump’s efforts to keep his [meetings with Mr. Putin secret](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/us/politics/trump-putin-russia-meetings.html) from even his own aides, and [an F.B.I. investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/us/politics/fbi-trump-russia-inquiry.html) into the administration’s Russia ties.
