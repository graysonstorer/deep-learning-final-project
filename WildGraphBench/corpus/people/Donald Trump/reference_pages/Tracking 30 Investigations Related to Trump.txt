Speaker Nancy Pelosi [announced](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/us/politics/democrats-impeachment-trump.html) that the House would begin a formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump, saying that he had betrayed his oath of office and the nation’s security in seeking to enlist a foreign power for his own political gain. Ms. Pelosi said she had directed the chairmen of the six committees that have been investigating Mr. Trump to “proceed under that umbrella of impeachment inquiry.”

Congressional Investigations
----------------------------

In the months since Democrats took control of the House, several committees have opened inquiries that could turn up politically damaging or embarrassing material or lead to impeachment proceedings. **Select an investigation to see more.**

1.

Possible abuse of power by using

foreign policy for political ends

House Foreign Affairs, Intelligence and Oversight Committees

presidency

The committees [opened an investigation](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/us/politics/trump-ukraine-house-investigation.html) in early September after the White House delayed a package of military assistance to Ukraine, which is fighting a war with Russian-backed separatists. The delay, which was later lifted amid bipartisan pressure from lawmakers, came on top of concerns about [efforts by Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/us/politics/giuliani-ukraine.html) to press the Ukrainian government to pursue investigations into two matters that date from the previous government and could be politically beneficial to Mr. Trump.

campaign

inauguration

presidency

As part of its investigation, which also includes possible attempts to obstruct its investigation of Russian election interference and ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, the House Intelligence Committee is seeking to study **Trump Organization** business transactions related to Russia and other foreign interests. On May 14, The Times reported that the committee is also looking into whether lawyers tied to Mr. Trump and his family helped [edit false testimony](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/politics/democrats-obstruction-trump.html) that **Mr. Cohen** provided to Congress about a Trump Tower project in Moscow, and then dangled a potential pardon to try to ensure his loyalty.

House Oversight and Reform Committee

The House Oversight and Reform Committee is looking into **Mr. Trump**’s involvement in the hush money payments to **Stormy Daniels**, and has indicated it will pursue other **Trump Organization** executives, including the president’s eldest son, **Donald Trump Jr.**, who appear to have had knowledge of the arrangement.

of power by Trump and his administration

House Judiciary Committee

business

campaign

inauguration

presidency

As part of a [broad inquiry](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/us/politics/trump-obstruction.html), the House Judiciary Committee is examining possible obstruction by **Mr. Trump** of the special counsel and congressional investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The committee is also looking into accusations of corruption, including possible violations of campaign finance law, the Constitution’s ban on foreign emoluments and the use of public office for personal gain. In March, the committee’s Democratic chairman, **Representative Jerrold Nadler** of New York, requested documents from 81 agencies, individuals and other entities tied to the president. On July 11, the committee approved a [dozen new subpoenas](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/11/us/politics/mueller-subpoena.html) targeting a who’s who of witnesses cited in the Mueller report.

5.

Possible abuses of the White

House security clearance process

House Oversight and Reform Committee

presidency

The committee is examining [possible abuses](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/us/politics/trump-security-clearances.html) by the White House in granting top-secret clearances to officials whose applications had been denied. Two of these officials were **Jared Kushner** and **Ivanka Trump**, the president’s son-in-law and eldest daughter.

6.

Whether Trump misrepresented his net worth

House Oversight and Reform Committee

business

Following Mr. Cohen’s testimony that **Mr. Trump** knowingly misstated his assets to banks, the committee subpoenaed records from **Mazars USA**, an accounting firm that had prepared Mr. Trump’s tax returns for many years. Mr. Trump [filed a lawsuit](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/22/us/politics/trump-sues-congress.html) to prevent Mazars from responding to a subpoena. A Federal District Court judge ruled on May 20 that the accounting firm must turn over Mr. Trump’s financial records to Congress. Mr. Trump’s legal team is expected to appeal the ruling.

7.

Alleged use of private messaging

by White House officials

House Oversight and Reform Committee

8.

Trump’s tax returns

House Ways and Means Committee

business

The committee is seeking six years of **Mr. Trump**’s personal and business tax returns. Technically, the request was made as part of a committee investigation into the I.R.S.’s practice of conducting mandatory audits of presidents, but the president’s allies say the committee’s real goal is to get the returns. (Mr. Trump is the first president in four decades to not publicly release his tax returns.) The Treasury Department said on May 6 that it would not release the returns voluntarily, and the committee [issued a subpoena](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/us/politics/democrats-trump-tax-returns.html), setting up a legal battle that is likely to be resolved by the Supreme Court. The House [filed a lawsuit](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/02/us/politics/trump-taxes-lawsuit.html) on July 2 to force the Treasury Department to turn over the tax returns.

9.

Trump’s communications with Putin

House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform Committees

presidency

The chairmen of the House Intelligence, Foreign Affairs and Oversight and Reform Committees [requested all documentation](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/us/politics/trump-putin-russia-meetings.html) related to meetings, telephone calls and other communication between **Mr. Trump** and President **Vladimir V. Putin** of Russia. The White House is unlikely to hand over these materials.

10.

Possible money laundering

House Intelligence and Financial Services Committees

business

Two congressional committees issued subpoenas to Deutsche Bank, the president’s primary lender over the last two decades, and Capital One, where Mr. Trump keeps some of his money. The subpoenas sought decades of personal and corporate financial records, including any documents related to possible suspicious activities detected in Mr. Trump’s personal and business accounts. Mr. Trump, his company and his three eldest children — Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka — filed a lawsuit on April 29 to block Deutsche Bank and Capital One from complying with the subpoenas. On May 22, a federal judge in Manhattan [ruled against](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/business/deutsche-bank-trump-subpoena.html) the president's request.

11.

Russian interference in the 2016 election

Senate Intelligence Committee

campaign

After two years of investigation, the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee is in the final stages of ironing out testimony and drawing up conclusions for eventual release. As a part of that process, the panel has called back several witnesses central to the investigation who previously were questioned only by members of the committee’s staff. It recently [subpoenaed](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/08/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-subpoena.html)**Donald Trump Jr.**, the president's eldest son, who was at the center of the now-famous meeting with a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer at Trump Tower in June 2016. On May 14, Donald Trump Jr. and the committee [reached a deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/us/politics/donald-trump-jr-intelligence-committee.html) for Mr. Trump to sit for a private interview in June.

12.

Proposed U.S. nuclear venture in Saudi Arabia

House Oversight and Reform Committee

presidency

House Democrats are examining allegations that the Trump administration has pushed a [plan to build nuclear power plants](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/us/politics/trump-saudi-arabia-nuclear-power.html) throughout Saudi Arabia — a venture that could enrich Trump allies — over the vigorous objections of White House lawyers. “Further investigation is needed to determine whether the actions being pursued by the Trump administration are in the national security interest of the United States or, rather, serve those who stand to gain financially as a result of this potential change in U.S. foreign policy,” committee staff wrote in February. In July, Democrats [released a report](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/29/us/politics/trump-adviser-said-to-have-pursued-saudi-nuclear-deal-as-he-sought-administration-role.html) alleging that Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a close friend of the president and a top donor to his 2016 campaign, sought a powerful position in the Trump administration at the same time he was pursuing the Saudi nuclear deal.

Federal Criminal Investigations
-------------------------------

Federal prosecutors are pursuing more than a dozen criminal investigations that [grew out of the work](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/03/31/us/politics/trump-investigations-that-grew-out-of-mueller.html) of Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel. These are the ones we know about.

The investigation partly grew out of a recording that F.B.I. agents seized when they raided the office, home and hotel room of **Michael D. Cohen**, Mr. Trump’s longtime personal laywer and fixer. On the recording, Mr. Cohen is heard discussing potential irregularities with **Stephanie Winston Wolkoff**, one of the main contractors for the inauguration.
