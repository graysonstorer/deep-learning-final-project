The House select committee laid out an ambitious road map for the prosecution of former President Donald J. Trump and several of his allies on Monday, saying they had committed a number of federal crimes by undertaking overlapping plans to reverse the results of the 2020 election.

But it remains unclear just how closely the special counsel’s office in charge of the Justice Department’s own investigation will follow the path mapped out by the committee — or whether Mr. Trump and others will face any criminal charges at all.

The panel’s [recommendations that charges should be brought](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/12/19/us/jan-6-committee-trump#jan-6-trump-criminal-justice-dept) were based on an exhaustive investigation that spanned months and included interviews with key witnesses that even federal prosecutors may not have spoken to yet.

In presenting [the committee’s findings](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/jan-6-committee-report-executive-summary/4d449a67cd79e131/full.pdf), Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, said he did not want the “foot soldiers” who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, to go to jail while “the masterminds and ringleaders get a free pass.”

Mr. Raskin explained that charges were warranted against Mr. Trump and others — chief among them the lawyer [John Eastman](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/02/us/politics/john-eastman-trump-memo.html), an architect of several plans to overturn Mr. Trump’s defeat. Nine months ago, Mr. Raskin noted, a federal judge in California, ruling in a civil case, [concluded that there was evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/28/us/politics/trump-election-crimes.html) that Mr. Trump and Mr. Eastman had conspired together to commit federal crimes.

As for the Justice Department’s efforts, not much is publicly known about any specific charges that the special counsel, [Jack Smith](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/19/us/politics/jack-smith-trump-special-counsel.html), might be considering in a criminal prosecution. The department is under no obligation to adopt the committee’s conclusions or to follow its recommendations.
