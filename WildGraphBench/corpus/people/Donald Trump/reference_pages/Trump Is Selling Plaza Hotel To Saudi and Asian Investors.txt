The Plaza Hotel, long a symbol of luxury and grandeur in New York and more recently the crown jewel in Donald J. Trump's shaky business empire, is being sold to two of the world's richest men: a Saudi Arabian Prince and one of Singapore's leading entrepreneurs.

The buyers said yesterday that the deal put a total value of $325 million on the landmark hotel at 59th Street and Fifth Avenue near Central Park.

In essence, the buyers are taking over the Plaza by assuming most of its debts. None of the money from the deal will go to Mr. Trump, who acquired the hotel for about $400 million in 1988. Rather, it will go to banks in the United States that had lent money to Mr. Trump and to banks in Japan that hold a mortgage on the hotel property.

While Mr. Trump will retain a say in the hotel's operations as a minority partner, his surrender of control is a defeat for the real estate developer, who in the heady days of the late 1980's proclaimed the Plaza "the ultimate trophy in the world." But the world has drastically changed for Mr. Trump since then, as real estate prices collapsed.

The complexity of the sale announced yesterday, and the international scope of the transaction, illustrated how the arenas of real estate and finance have grown beyond national boundaries, and how the business world has shrunk, in ways even the most visionary people could have hardly imagined when the Plaza opened in 1907.

The sale, rumored for weeks, was announced in Singapore by CDL Hotels International Ltd. The company, which owns 35 hotels around the world including the Hotel Macklowe the Millenium in Manhattan, said it had formed a venture with an entity controlled by Prince Walid bin Talal, a 40-year-old nephew of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia who has been buying into the luxury hotel business.

:

A chart in Business Day yesterday about the history of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan misspelled the surname of the man who bought it in 1958. It was Lawrence A. Wien, not Wein.
