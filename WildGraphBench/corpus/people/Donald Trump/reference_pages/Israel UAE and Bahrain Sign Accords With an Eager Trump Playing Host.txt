Israel, U.A.E. and Bahrain Sign Accords, With an Eager Trump Playing Host
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

President Trump said the agreements to normalize relations marked “the dawn of a new Middle East,” but some analysts said his claims were overblown.

WASHINGTON — Israel and two Arab nations signed agreements at the White House on Tuesday to normalize their relations, a step toward a realignment of the Middle East but one that failed to address the future of the Palestinians.

President Trump presided over a South Lawn ceremony where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of [Israel](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/14/world/middleeast/israel-coalition-march-hamas.html) and the foreign ministers of [Bahrain](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/world/middleeast/khalifa-bin-salman-al-khalifa-bahrain-dead.html) and the United Arab Emirates signed a general declaration of principles the White House has named the Abraham Accords, after the biblical father of three monotheistic religions, as well individual agreements between Israel and the two Arab states.

Mr. Trump pronounced it a historic moment for their region. “After decades of division and conflict, we mark the dawn of a new Middle East,” Mr. Trump said.

The texts of the agreements detail how the three countries will open embassies and establish other new diplomatic and economic ties, including tourism, technology and energy. Israel and the Emirates are beginning commercial air travel between their countries for the first time, and Bahrain has opened its airspace for those flights.

They make scant reference to the fate of the Palestinians, but include a call for “a just, comprehensive and enduring resolution of the Israeli- Palestinian conflict.”

The accords are the first such agreements between Israel and an Arab state since 1994, when the Jewish state established diplomatic relations with Jordan. They are also another step toward the formation of a de facto alliance between Israel and the Gulf’s Sunni Arab monarchies against their common enemy, Shiite Iran. Pressuring Iran has been a central goal of Mr. Trump’s foreign policy, and Trump officials have worked to build a common regional front against Tehran in which Saudi Arabia has played a major role.
