Broadening the Definition of Independent Contractor Link Copied

This rule expands the definition of when an employee can be considered an independent contractor for purposes of benefits and labor laws, advantaging "gig economy" companies like Uber and DoorDash. The public had 30 days to submit comments, half the typical period; the Department of Labor said that "the lack of regulatory guidance underscores the need for an expedient rulemaking." The Biden administration has proposed delaying its effective date for further review.

Allowing Tip Pooling With Back-of-House Restaurant Workers Link Copied

After Congress thwarted the department's initial attempt to allow employers to skim tips as long as workers were still making at least the minimum wage, this new rulemaking would only let servers pool tips with cooks and other nontipped staff. According to the government's analysis, that could still result in a small transfer to employers if they were able to reduce the pay of back-of-house workers. The Biden administration has proposed delaying the rule's effective date for further review.

Replacing the H1-B Visa Lottery by Prioritizing Immigrant Workers With the Highest Salaries Link Copied

This rule changes the way in which the finite number of H1-B visas for high-skilled foreign workers are allocated among companies, giving first priority to those paid the most. Critics worry that this will lock out entry-level workers and those in less lucrative professions like teaching and nursing. The Biden administration pushed back the effective date for further comment.

Tightening Eligibility for Disabled Veterans' Access to Medical Devices Link Copied

This rule defines the standard of eligibility for prosthetics, medical alert systems and adaptive recreation aids that disabled veterans must meet before the Department of Veterans Affairs will cover the cost. Advocates for disabled veterans warned that the new regulations could limit access to devices that are essential to a disabled person's quality of life.

Excluding Scientific Studies From Environmental Policy-making Link Copied

Known to its supporters as the "secret science" or "transparency" rule (and to its opponents as the "censored science" rule), it would limit the Environmental Protection Agency's ability to consider scientific research where the raw data isn't completely public. It could exclude many epidemiology and public health studies where the raw data contains private medical information. A federal judge in Montana struck down the rule on Feb. 1.

Increasing the Speed at Which Chickens May Be Slaughtered Link Copied

Under this rule chicken factories would be allowed to run faster, increasing potential profits but putting workers at higher risk of injuries like amputations and carpal tunnel. These safety concerns thwarted a previous effort to raise speeds during the Obama administration, but the Trump administration issued case-by-case waivers allowing some plants to speed up anyway, laying the groundwork for an across-the-board increase. The Biden administration withdrew the proposal.

Restricting High-Skilled Immigrant Work Visas by Raising Wage Minimums for Visa Holders Link Copied

This regulation went into effect immediately when issued on Oct. 8, although a public comment period remained open through Nov. 9. It overhauls the rubrics that set how much employers must pay an immigrant to sponsor them on a temporary H-1B "high skilled" worker visa. New wage standards are substantially higher, making many would-be immigrants suddenly ineligible. The Biden administration has delayed this rule.

Ending Medicare Drug Rebates Link Copied

This rule would end drug company payments to middlemen in Medicare. Health plans oppose it because they would get stuck covering higher drug costs.

Overhauling Guidance on Religious Discrimination in the Workplace Link Copied

In a lightning-fast process, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued sweeping changes to a 12-year-old guidance document on workplace religious discrimination that originally took years to draft.

Making it Harder to Raise Energy Efficiency Standards for Gas Water Heaters Link Copied

Granting a petition from the natural gas industry, the Energy Department ruled that it couldn't establish efficiency standards for gas-powered furnaces and water heaters that would require the installation of condensing technology, because it said older non-condensing furnaces were a "feature" desired by consumers. The move could lead to much higher gas demand.

Exempting Refineries, Chemical Plants and Other Polluters from EPA's Greenhouse Gas Regulations Link Copied

The rule would allow the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions only from industries that are responsible for more than 3% of national greenhouse gas emissions. Power plants would still be regulated, but other major polluters including steel mills, incinerators and industrial boilers would be exempt. The rule would go into effect in March.

Revising Grant Rules to Bolster Religous Groups Link Copied

The Department of Health and Human Services revised its grant rules to roll back some Obama-era changes and insulate religious groups from nondiscrimation requirements. Democrats say the new rule will undermine the civil rights of LGBTQ+ people, religious minorities and women. The agency finished the rule unusually quickly, proposing it on Nov. 19 and finalizing it on Jan. 12. The Biden administration may be able to stop the changes from taking effect on Feb. 11.

Exempting Railroads From Hours-of-Service Requirements Link Copied

In response to a petition from railroad lobbying groups, the agency granted an exemption for their members' employees who are subject to rules that limit the number of hours they can be on duty before a break to 14. The railroads said it would be helpful for workers to be able to respond to emergencies outside that window. Labor groups have resisted similar expansions in the past, saying that staff inevitably feel pressure to work longer hours, which can be unsafe.

Reining in "Zombie" Debt Collection, a Little Link Copied

The rule holds debt collectors liable for suing consumers over debt that has expired, known as "zombie" debt. But the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau didn't go so far as to ban the collection of zombie debt, as advocacy groups wanted. That means companies are still allowed to send letters and make phone calls about the old debts, and if consumers start repaying, the debt becomes fair game again for the company to sue.

Relaxing Nutritional Requirements for School Lunches Link Copied

After losing in court on a previous attempt, the Department of Agriculture is trying again to relax nutrutional requirements for school lunches, allowing more salt, white flour and flavored milk. Even with an abbreviated comment period, the rule would be tough to finalize before Jan. 20.

Loosening Permits to Develop Near Waterways and Wetlands Link Copied

This rule would expedite the permits for many activities regulated by the Clean Water Act. Some of the items are relatively innocuous, such as boat ramps. But others — such as oil and gas pipelines or surface coal mining —have huge impacts that environmentalists say shouldn't get waved through without scrutiny.

Locks in Use of Less Efficient Gas Furnaces and Water Heaters Link Copied

Imposing Tariffs on Vietnam on the Basis of Its "Undervalued" Currency Link Copied

An investigation found that Vietnam was selling tires at subsidized prices on the U.S. market, laying the legal groundwork for tariffs. More importantly, this is the first time an "undervalued" currency has been used as a factor in the subsidy calculation, drawing objections from those who believe that trade policy shouldn't intervene in foreign exchange markets.

Forcing Deportation Hearings for Some Immigrants Who Have Pending Applications for Legal Status Link Copied

By redefining what counts as "good cause" to postpone a deportation hearing, this regulation would make it harder for immigrants to get postponements. It would generally prevent judges from postponing deportation hearings to see if a pending application for legal status is approved.

Endangered and Threatened Species: Regulations for Designating Critical Habitat Link Copied

This rule clarifies standards for designating endangered species habitats to give more weight to landowners' rights and economic factors, making it less likely that land will be protected for wildlife preservation. The agency allowed only 30 days to comment, rather than the usual 60.

Barring Work Permits for Immigrants With Deportation Orders Link Copied

Some immigrants who get final deportation orders end up staying in the U.S. for a time, usually because their home countries won't accept deportees. This rule would prevent such immigrants from being able to legally work in the U.S. The truncated comment period for the proposed rule ends in mid-December, making it unlikely, though not impossible, that it will be finalized before the inauguration.

Making Families of Noncitizen Immigrants Ineligible for Subsidized Housing Link Copied

Earlier in 2019, the Department of Housing and Urban Development proposed a rule denying subsidized housing for the families of noncitizen immigrants. Now, the Department of Agriculture is doing the same for the Rural Housing Service, which could result in the eviction of many low-income families.
