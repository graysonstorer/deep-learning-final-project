O n the campaign trail, [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) repeatedly promised to “protect religious liberty”, and two weeks after his inauguration he acted: creating a “[White House](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trump-administration) faith office”, which will be led by Paula White, a millionaire televangelist known to speak in tongues who called the Black Lives Matter movement the “Antichrist” and once encouraged people to buy [“resurrection seeds”](https://www.christianpost.com/news/televangelist-paula-white-hawks-resurrection-life-1144-dollar-seed.html) for $1,114.

The move brought renewed focus on White, Trump’s longtime spiritual guru. And for White, not all of it will be welcome.

In March, she was criticized over an alleged cash-for-blessings scandal, while other rightwing Christians are unhappy with her new government role, with one describing White as “100% a false teacher”.

White [will be “senior adviser”](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/president-trump-announces-appointments-to-the-white-house-faith-office/) of Trump’s faith office, which Trump announced along with [an executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/eradicating-anti-christian-bias/) which created a “Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias”.

![Image 6: a women looking at a camera ](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8918ba496b6615bc826299dca378a27615601ac4/0_0_6000_4000/master/6000.jpg?width=445&dpr=1&s=none&crop=none)[View image in fullscreen](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/05/paula-white-faith-office-trump#img-2)

“While I am in the White House, we will protect Christians in our schools, in our military, in our government, in our workplaces, hospitals, and in our public squares, and we will bring our countries back together as one nation under God, with liberty and justice for all,” Trump said in a speech announcing the creation of the faith office.

The appointment of White suggests some of those methods of protection could be unorthodox. In March, as Easter approached, White was criticised for [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOkpptVF8Tw) in which she appeared to offer “seven supernatural blessings” for the price of $1,000, including the assignation of a personal angel. White, whose preaching has been described as adhering to “prosperity gospel” theology – the belief that praying will result in financial gains – said the blessings would also include prosperity and “increase in inheritance”.

White denied that people had to pay to receive the blessings, a spokesperson for Paula White Ministries [telling the Christian Post](https://www.christianpost.com/news/trump-advisor-paula-white-cain-promises-supernatural-blessings.html): “This story is a deceptive smear. Pastor White specifically says in the very same video, ‘you’re not doing this to get something,’ and the solicitation, which was later in the program, makes it clear that any donation to the ministry should only be ‘as the Holy Spirit leads.’ Moreover, donations to the ministry do not directly benefit Pastor White.”

Still, even some rightwing Christians were unimpressed with White’s appointment. Jon Root, a Turning Point USA contributor and conservative influencer who supports Trump, [told Notus](https://www.notus.org/whitehouse/donald-trump-faith-office): “Anybody that you know holds true to strong biblical conviction and discernment wouldn’t be involved with Paula White. She’s 100% a false teacher.”

In any case, the “seven supernatural blessings” was not the first time White has introduced finances into faith. In 2016, she offered [“resurrection seeds” for sale for $1,144](https://www.christianpost.com/news/televangelist-paula-white-hawks-resurrection-life-1144-dollar-seed-162088/), claiming in a recorded speech that God had told her the price point.

“There’s someone that God is speaking to, to click on that donation button by minimizing the screen. And when you do, to sow $1,144,” she said. “It’s not often I ask very specifically but God has instructed me and I want you to hear. This isn’t for everyone but this is for someone. When you sow that $1,144 based on John 11:44, I believe for resurrection life.”

White said people could also pay $144 or $44 if they could not afford God’s suggested total. The money appeared to grant individuals a metaphorical, rather than physical, seed, and the price included a prayer cloth, which White said could bring “special miracles”, and recommended it be placed under a loved one’s bed.

It is unclear how many seeds were sold. But it is known that there have been questions over White’s financial maneuvers. [CNN reported](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/01/05/politics/paula-white-critics/index.html) that White’s former church, Without Walls International, received $150m between 2004 and 2006, and a three-year investigation by Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa, [described how the church](https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/WWIC%20Whites%2001-05-11.pdf) and White’s personal ministry used tax-exempt funds to pay a million dollars in salaries to family members and spent money on a private jet. The investigation closed with no penalties – although [investigators said they were stifled by lifelong confidentially agreements](https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/WWIC%20Whites%2001-05-11.pdf)that had been signed by church employees.

Other questions about White relate to her beliefs and statements on issues including race and immigration. [The Grio reported](https://thegrio.com/2025/02/06/paula-white-blm-anti-christ-trump-new-white-house-faith-office/) that White had particular animus for the Black Lives Matter movement, and said in a 2020 speech: “Christ’s likeness is not found in my gender, it is not found in my culture, it is not found in my ethnicity, it is not found in KKK, it is not found in Antifa, and it is not found in Black Lives Matter. All of which are anti-Christ, and even terrorist organizations.”

Trump, whose commitment to true freedom of religion has repeatedly been questioned, in January [rescinded guidance](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/migrants-can-now-be-arrested-at-churches-and-schools-after-trump-administration-throws-out-policies) that prevented Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection from carrying out immigration enforcement in churches – more than two dozen Christian groups are [suing the government](https://www.npr.org/2025/02/11/g-s1-48184/27-religious-groups-sue-administration-over-immigration-enforcement-policy) over the policy – but that apparent lack of sympathy appears to match White’s views. During Trump’s first term, White, then the president’s spiritual adviser, raised eyebrows when she said Jesus would have been “sinful” and not “our Messiah” if he had broken immigration law.

“I think so many people have taken biblical scriptures out of context on this, to say stuff like: ‘Well, Jesus was a refugee,’” [White told](https://cbn.com/news/news/these-children-are-being-trafficked-we-must-have-stricter-border-laws-pastor-paula-white) the Christian Broadcasting Network.

“And yes, he did live in Egypt for three and a half years. But it was not illegal. If he had broke the law, then he would have been sinful and he would not have been our Messiah.”

From questionable financial accounting, to strident views on protests against the killings of young Black men, to a disdain for immigrants, it seems White could be a perfect match for Trump.

At this unsettling time
-----------------------

We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could spare 37 seconds to support our most important fundraising appeal of the year.

In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year on from his second victory, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one.

From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced.

While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts.

While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel.

**Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less.**

**But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, it means we’ll show you fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you.**
