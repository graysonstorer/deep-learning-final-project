As the coronavirus pandemic accelerates a national trend toward voting by mail, experts say it can be conducted safely, despite Republican claims of corruption.

With concerns mounting over how the country can conduct elections during a pandemic and Democrats pressing for alternatives to in-person voting, President Trump has begun pushing a false argument that has circulated among conservatives for years — that [voting by mail](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/magazine/trump-voter-fraud.html) is a recipe for [fraud](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/04/technology/biden-michigan-votes.html).

“Mail ballots, they cheat,” Mr. Trump said at the White House on Tuesday afternoon. “Mail ballots are very dangerous for this country because of cheaters. They go collect them. They are fraudulent in many cases. They have to vote. They should have voter ID, by the way.”

The president spoke as Wisconsin voters, many wearing protective masks, [were going to the polls on a fraught Election Day](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/politics/wisconsin-election-coronavirus.html), after the Republican-led legislature refused Democratic demands to delay the election and allow for expanded [mail-in voting](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/us/politics/vote-by-mail.html). On Wednesday, Mr. Trump claimed again that there was “tremendous potential for [voter fraud](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/us/politics/voter-fraud-disinformation.html).”

Here’s a look at the facts on the matter.

All voter fraud is extremely rare.
----------------------------------

[Studies have shown](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/18/us/voter-fraud.html) that all forms of voting fraud are extremely rare in the United States. A national study in 2016 found few credible allegations of fraudulent voting. A panel that Mr. Trump charged with investigating election corruption [found no real evidence of fraud](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/us/politics/trump-voter-fraud-commission.html) before he disbanded it in 2018.

Even so, experts say that the mail voting system is more vulnerable to fraud than voting in person.

“What we know can be boiled down to this: Voting fraud in the United States is rare, less rare is fraud using mail ballots,” said Charles Stewart III of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Mr. Stewart pointed to several documented voting fraud cases of recent decades involving mail or absentee ballots, most recently the race in North Carolina’s Ninth Congressional District in 2018, when an operative who rounded up absentee ballots for the Republican candidate, Mark Harris, was [charged with election fraud](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/30/us/mccrae-dowless-indictment.html). The practice is known as ballot harvesting.
