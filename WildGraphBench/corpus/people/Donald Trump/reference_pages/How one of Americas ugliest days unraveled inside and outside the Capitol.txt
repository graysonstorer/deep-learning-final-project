Jan. 6, 2021, was always on the country’s radar.

Two runoff elections that would determine control of the Senate still had not been decided as Tuesday became Wednesday. A joint session of Congress convened to certify Joe Biden’s electoral-vote win while thousands gathered on the Mall in support of President Trump, who continued to falsely claim that the election was stolen from him.

As the scene in D.C. [continued to darken](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/video-timeline-capitol-breach/), smaller demonstrations across the nation also flared, forcing officials in several statehouses to evacuate.

This is how the day unfolded.

### Trump rallies his supporters as Congress convenes

Crowds began forming early in the morning on the White House Ellipse for Trump’s “Save America” rally. During his speech, Trump reiterated multiple falsehoods, claiming the election was rigged and that Democrats had committed voter fraud. By midday, the Capitol was buzzing as Congress convened in a joint session and pro-Trump protesters began to gather around the building’s perimeter.

In the days that followed, shaken and angry members of Congress demanded that Trump take responsibility for inciting violence. Democrats, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), [called for Trump’s immediate removal from office](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-impeachment-capitol-mob/2021/01/08/700da13a-51db-11eb-83e3-322644d82356_story.html), either through the 25th Amendment or impeachment.

Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick died Thursday night of unspecified injuries he suffered in the attack.

Trump eventually released a video Thursday evening, calling for calm and declaring he is now focused on a “smooth, orderly, seamless transition of power.” The very next morning, however, he sent another tweet:

Twitter [permanently suspended](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/08/twitter-trump-dorsey/) Trump’s account around 6:20 p.m. Friday night for “incitement of violence.”
