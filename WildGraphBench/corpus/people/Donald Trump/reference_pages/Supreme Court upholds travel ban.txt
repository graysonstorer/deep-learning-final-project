The Supreme Court upheld Trump's travel ban today. Here's how it went down.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Image 7: People demonstrate against US President Trump's travel ban as protesters gather outside the U.S. Supreme Court following a court issued immigration ruling June 26, 2018 in Washington, DC.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/4e3d54ec-0033-49e6-ab19-a83b7e84ee23.jpg?q=h_702,w_1024,x_0,y_0/w_1280/f_avif)

People demonstrate against US President Trump's travel ban as protesters gather outside the U.S. Supreme Court following a court issued immigration ruling June 26, 2018 in Washington, DC.

The Supreme Court[upheld](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/26/politics/travel-ban-supreme-court/index.html) President Donald Trump’s travel ban, which restricts entry from seven countries to varying degrees: Iran, North Korea, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Venezuela.

Here’s everything you need to know:

*   **The ruling**: It was 5-4 along partisan lines, with Chief Justice John Roberts writing for the conservative majority. “The Proclamation is squarely within the scope of Presidential authority,” Roberts wrote. 
*   **The dissenting opinion**: Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a blistering dissent, said the court was wrong to ignore Trump’s various comment on the ban. She also compared the court’s opinion to one that came down in 1944 in which the court blessed the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II. That case is Korematsu v. United States. 
*   **An unusual step**: Chief Justice John Roberts declared that the 1944 case, Korematsu v. United States, was [no longer good law and was wrongly decided](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/26/politics/korematsu-supreme-court-travel-ban-roberts-sotomayor/index.html). It is the first time the Supreme Court has ever made this public determination. 
*   **The reaction**: The American Civil Liberties Union and Democratic lawmakers strongly denounced the court’s ruling. 
*   **What Trump said:** He called the ruling “a tremendous victory for the American People and the Constitution” and said he felt vindicated.

Protesters chant "shame" in New York demonstration
--------------------------------------------------

 From CNN's Gisela Crespo 

Protesters in New York City demonstrated Tuesday against the Supreme Court’s ruling to uphold President Trump’s travel ban and his administration’s immigration policies.

Genia Blaser took this video of protesters in New York City’s Foley Square chanting“shame” as a speaker mentioned the President, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, White House chief of staff John Kelly and the Supreme Court by name.

**Saima Anjam also took this video of the protest:**

Who's affected by Trump's travel ban, by the numbers
----------------------------------------------------

 From CNN's Aaron Kessler 

Now that President Donald Trump’s travel ban has the Supreme Court’s blessing, the fate of people in the seven already designated countries appears dire when it comes to their chances of coming to the United States.

While it’s difficult to pin down who may or may not intend to visit, study or even become an immigrant to America, the most recent data available from the US State Department provides [a window into ballpark figures](http://www.cnn.com/2018/06/26/politics/travel-ban-by-the-numbers/index.html).

**During the 2017 fiscal year**, the government issued about 87,000 “non-immigrant” visas from the seven nations affected by the administration’s travel ban. Those include people ranging from tourists to students to those doing business in the United States (There were 9.7 million such visas issued worldwide during the fiscal year).

While much of the attention has focused on the ban’s aim at Muslim-majority nations, the largest contingent of non-immigrant visas actually went to Venezuela. In fact, Venezuela had nearly twice as many visas as all the other countries combined.

**Here are the individual countries broken down:**

*    Iran — 19,801 
*    North Korea — 55 
*    Syria — 5,411 
*    Libya — 1,552 
*    Yemen — 2,919 
*    Somalia — 276 
*    Venezuela — 56,720 

**The picture is quite different for those seeking to immigrate**. Of about 20,000 immigrant visas granted in fiscal year 2017 to those coming from the seven countries, the largest contingents are actually from Iran and Yemen, State Department records show. Venezuela is in the middle of the pack, roughly the same as those from Syria.

The total number of immigrant visas worldwide by the US was about 560,000 during that period, so the seven countries still make up just a fraction of the total.

This is what protests looked like in Seattle today
--------------------------------------------------

 From CNN's Gisela Crespo 

Jay Billings took this video of two separate protests coming together outside a federal courthouse in Seattle, Washington.

Protesters can be heard chanting“no ban, no wall,”as demonstrators in one protest walk toward the other group gathered outside the William Kenzo Nakamura United States Courthouse.

**Watch the moment:**

Travel ban is not likely to shake up diplomacy talks with North Korea
---------------------------------------------------------------------

 From CNN's Zachary Cohen 

![Image 8: President Donald Trump (R) meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (L) at the start of their historic summit at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa island in Singapore on June 12, 2018.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/3513a935-fa42-42de-8679-34c2c8a60b67.jpg?q=h_683,w_1024,x_0,y_0/w_1280/f_avif)

President Donald Trump (R) meets with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un (L) at the start of their historic summit at the Capella Hotel on Sentosa island in Singapore on June 12, 2018.

While the Supreme Court’s decision has sparked outrage from Democrats who argue the travel ban is both unconstitutional and discriminatory, [there is little expectation](http://www.cnn.com/2018/06/26/politics/trump-travel-ban-ruling-north-korea/index.html) within the administration and on Capitol Hill that it will hinder diplomatic talks with North Korea.

The travel ban, which restricts entry into the US from seven countries, including North Korea, comes as the administration continues its efforts to establish meaningful negotiations with Pyongyang in the wake of the President Trump’s summit with dictator Kim Jong Un earlier this month.

**According to the State Department**, the decision will have little impact on a practical level, because North Korean travel to the United States was already severely limited before this ruling.

And despite the ban’s restrictions, a House Foreign Affairs Committee aide noted that North Korean officials could still be allowed to travel to the US on a case by case basis if they are granted a waiver similar to the one that allowed one of Kim’s top advisers to visit the White House earlier this month.

Trump does not support a ban on all Muslims, White House spokesperson says
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah told CNN that President Trump does not support a ban on all Muslims.

“Of course not,” Shah said in response to a question on whether Trump supported banning all Muslims from the United States.

Shah said the administration’s ban is based on “security requirements” and “a minimal standard and allows our government to feel confident that we know who these individuals coming into our country are.”

This Syrian couple is expecting their first child and they're afraid for their future
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 From CNN's Catherine Shoichet 

![Image 10: The front of the United States Supreme Court with classic columns and pediment](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/72bdc391-0996-4fc5-8c3e-cad9b4cb32b2.jpg?q=h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0/w_1280/f_avif)

Mohamad Mashta says the Supreme Court’s decision Tuesday left him and his wife feeling isolated and uncertain.

“If they are allowed to have this ban, what will they try next? Will I be sent away?” Mashta said on a conference call with reporters. “We are afraid for our future.”

Mashta came to the United States from Syria on a student visa in 2012. He was later granted asylum, according to court documents, and now works as an engineer at an auto manufacturing plant in Ohio. He was among the plaintiffs in one of several lawsuits challenging the travel ban,[IRAP v. Trump](https://www.aclu.org/cases/international-refugee-assistance-project-v-trump).

Living through different versions of the ban has been harrowing, he said.For months, he was unsure whether his wife — who fled Syria and headed to Sudan — would be allowed to come to the United States. Ultimately, her visa was approved and she was able to come to the United States in October 2017, he said. But that didn’t quell his concerns.

**“**Reuniting with my wife was the light in a dark year. Still, we are not sure what the future will bring,” he said. “We still have family affected by the third ban, like my wife’s father and siblings, who cannot come visit us.”

That’s especially devastating, Mashta said, since he and his wife are expecting their first child in September.

“All I can say now,” he said, “is this decision made us feel like we are second-class people.”

Such concerns are going to be increasingly widespread as a result of Tuesday’s ruling, said Omar Jadwat, director of the ACLU’s Immigrants’ Rights Project.

“People who have every legal right to live here who are not affected by the ban, some of those people are now faced with a decision, do I continue to live in the United States? Or now that half of my family is stuck in another country and can’t come join me, do I now have to leave and give up on my American Dream?”

Jeff Sessions praises travel ban decision, rails on judges issuing nationwide injunctions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 From CNN's Laura Jarrett

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, speaking about immigration in Los Angeles, said he was pleased with the Supreme Court’s travel ban decision today and criticized judges issuing nationwide injunctions.

He said he hopes “this goes some way to ending the practice of nationwide injunctions which in my view gravely threaten the rule of law,” and emphasized that a “single judge out of 600” can issue one.

“This decision is critical to ensuring the continued authority of President Trump — and all future presidents — to protect the American people,” Sessions said.

He continued: “It is the President, after all, who is elected and entrusted with the safety and security of the American people and to enforce an immigration system that serves the national interest. He’s the chief executive … we respect courts and their legal opinions … they aren’t a policy setting branch … they don’t get to set the policy for the country.”

Travel ban is a "slap in the face" to Somalian refugees, humanitarian group says
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 From CNN's Anna Cardovillis 

![Image 12: A world map illustrating the Trump Administration's travel restrictions, with countries highlighted in red including Venezuela, Libya, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, and North Korea](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/94ef82c1-9064-401c-95d4-67fb314d644b.png?q=h_870,w_1546,x_0,y_0/w_1280/f_avif)

Geno Teofilo, a spokeman for the Norwegian Refugee Council, a humanitarian organization, called the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold President Trump’s travel “shocking and unjust.”

In a statement, Teofilo said the travel ban essentially shuts the door on refugee families who have been waiting for years to enter the US.

This is his full statement:

“**Barring the entry of vulnerable refugees and asylum seekers is a slap in the face to thousands of innocent refugee families from Somalia**. These families and others like them have been patiently waiting for years to resettle themselves and their children, while undergoing strict vetting and adhering to US policies. Now the door of welcome has been slammed shut. This ban creates a greater burden on other countries in East Africa that will continue to host these refugees. Th**is Supreme Court ruling coming from a country founded by immigrants is shocking and unjust**.”

Separately, the director of the Somali American Community Center in Clarkston, Georgia, said the court’s decision marks a “sad day.”

“Most of us are fleeing from Islamic terrorists. People who are trying to hurt some other Muslims,” Omar Shekhey told CNN.

The Supreme Court finally rejected a 74-year-old decision allowing Japanese-American internment
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 From CNN's Ariane de Vouge 

![Image 13: American flag flying over scene of two children running on dusty wind swept grounds of Manzanar relocation camp, one of several such camps housing forcibly relocated Japanese nationals and American citizens of Japanese descent during WWII.](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/0126261b-9e6d-4424-bec0-c0a746f9b4f7.jpg?q=h_438,w_780,x_0,y_0/w_1280/f_avif)

American flag flying over scene of two children running on dusty wind swept grounds of Manzanar relocation camp, one of several such camps housing forcibly relocated Japanese nationals and American citizens of Japanese descent during WWII.

Chief Justice John Roberts and his conservative majority upheld President Donald Trump’s travel ban Tuesday, but in the process — thanks to a heated argument with Justice Sonia Sotomayor — finally overturned the[infamous 1944 Supreme Court decision](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/323/214) blessing internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.

Here’s how it happened:

*   **Sotomayor brought up the case:**In her[dissent to the majority’s ruling on the travel ban](http://www.cnn.com/2018/06/26/politics/read-scotus-travel-ban-decision/index.html), Sotomayor compared the decision to the Korematsu v. US case, saying there are “stark parallels” in the reasoning. 
*   **Roberts responded:** The comparison triggered an angry response from Roberts, who chastised his colleague for using “rhetorical advantage” and said that Korematsu had “nothing to do with this case.” 
*   **Then, Roberts went further:** Roberts was troubled enough with the comparison, however, that he did something that no party involved in the travel ban case had expressly asked for: He announced that the Supreme Court was overruling Korematsu.

Rep. Don Beyer (D-VA) 

Rep. Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia, urged Congress to act and overturn the Supreme Court’s ruling to uphold President Trump’s travel ban.

“Congress has to act,” he said. “We have to overturn what the Supreme Court has done. We cannot let this stand.”

Beyer called the ban “racist” and “immoral,” adding that the court’s decision today was “disappointing and it’s wrong.”

“And if the Supreme Court’s going to do this, it’s up to Congress to pass the Freedom of Religion (Restoration) Act, which will ban any law which will prohibit people from coming to this country because of their religious views,” he said.

How the travel ban could affect visitors coming to the US
---------------------------------------------------------

 From CNN's Holly Yan 

The Supreme Court just handed a huge victory to the Trump administration by[upholding its controversial travel ban](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/26/politics/travel-ban-supreme-court/index.html)– which restricts nationals from seven countries from entering the US.

The Trump administration says the ban restricts entry from the following seven countries to varying degrees: **Iran, North Korea, Syria, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Venezuela.**

Here’s what the [latest travel ban](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/26/politics/travel-ban-effects-on-people-trnd/index.html) means to travelers coming to the US:

Jeff Flake: The travel ban could ultimately make us less safe

Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake just told CNN’s Manu Raju that the world likely sees the Supreme Court-approved travel ban “for what it is intended to be.”

“I don’t think it’s wise. I don’t think it lends to a matter of national security,” Flake said on Capitol Hill. “The President’s intent was pretty much outlined in December of 2015, when he said he wanted a Muslim ban of all Muslims entering the United States.”

“I think they got it to where they needed to be constitutional but I think the world sees it for what it is intended to be,” the Republican lawmaker said, adding that the ban could make the country less safe because it could be interpreted as “US vs Islam rather than the West vs. terrorism.”

Trump again calls the court decision a "tremendous victory for the American People"

President Trump, speaking publicly for the first time since the Supreme Court ruled in favor of his travel ban, called the decision a “tremendous success.”

“Today’s Supreme court ruling just coming out: A tremendous success, a tremendous victory for the American people, and for our Constitution. This is a great victory for our Constitution. We have to be tough, and we have to be safe and we have to be secure,” he said.

He added: “At a minimum, we have to make sure that we vet people coming into the country.”

The comment closely mirrored the statement Trump released shortly after the decision was announced, in which he declared, “Today’s Supreme Court ruling is a tremendous victory for the American People and the Constitution.”

![Image 19: Congressman Mike Quigley delivers a statement in front of three American flags](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c496e7dd-9b6e-4b9f-b8ef-c73ef6955fd4.jpg?q=h_900,w_1600,x_0,y_0/w_1280/f_avif)

House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley just issued a statement saying today’s decision “will be remembered as one where the Supreme Court of the United States legitimized discrimination and religious intolerance.”

He called it “deeply shameful” and said it “strikes at the heart of the principles our nation was founded on and the values we hold dear as Americans.”

The statement added:

“Instituting a religious test and vilifying refugees seeking asylum is immoral, ignorant, and hateful. President Trump’s Muslim Ban is the antithesis to everything we stand for, and we will continue to fight against this policy and this administration’s xenophobic and intolerant agenda.”

The powerful 10-term incumbent, who is often mentioned as a possible successor to California’s Rep. Nancy Pelosi as Democratic leader (perhaps as early as next year), is being [challenged](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/26/politics/what-to-watch-june-26-races-election-midterms/index.html) today by activist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York’s primary.

Keith Ellison predicts travel ban decision will end up in "dust bin of history"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 From CNN's Clare Foran 

![Image 20: Keith Ellison speaking at a podium with two microphones, wearing a suit, tie, and glasses, with an American flag in the background](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/008a40db-f403-479b-a8b3-b06d5bb0a36e.jpg?q=h_438,w_780,x_0,y_0/w_1280/f_avif)

The first Muslim elected to Congress [predicted on Tuesday](http://www.cnn.com/2018/06/26/politics/trump-travel-ban-keith-ellison-cnntv/index.html) that the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold President Donald Trump’s travel ban will end up in “the dust bin of history,” adding that Trump has tailored the court to “his ugly philosophy.”

“Our country has gone through some ugly days. The Supreme Court in the 1850s said that it was OK to own a black person, that was the Dred Scott decision. That decision hit the dust bin of history … and this one will too,” Rep. Keith Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota, told CNN’s Kate Bolduan on “At This Hour.”

“Discrimination and racism and hatred and religious bigotry is never going to be winning in the end,” Ellison said.

Ellison said that the President “has his Supreme Court tailor-made to his ugly philosophy,” calling it a “partisan court.”

He added that he does not believe Justice Neil Gorsuch, whom Trump appointed after congressional Republicans blocked former President Barack Obama from filling a vacancy late in his presidency, is on the court “properly.”

“It just proves one thing, that if you steal and rip off a Supreme Court justice, then you can try to jam any kind of nasty, racist, ugly policy down the throat’s of the American people. But we’re not taking it,” Ellison said.

Analysis: Why today's ruling is a big win for the White House -- and future presidents
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Analysis by Stephen Vladeck 

![Image 21: Donald Trump is shown in a close-up shot in front of a microphone, wearing a suit and a red tie](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ea5186b5-e7b7-4ff9-a0c4-c55baa5ef8eb.jpg?q=h_438,w_780,x_0,y_0/w_1280/f_avif)

Stephen Vladeck, CNN’s Supreme Court analyst and a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law, called the ruling a “big win” for the White House.

“The Supreme Court has reaffirmed the President’s sweeping statutory authority when it comes to deciding who may and who may not travel to the United States, authority that both President Trump and future presidents will surely rely upon to justify more aggressive immigration restrictions,” Vladeck said.

However, Vladeck noted that this was the third version of the travel ban and the administration made significant changes in response to lower-court rulings invalidating the first two iterations, including one issued one week after Trump became president in January 2017.

Key House Democrat on travel ban ruling: The Supreme Court "got it wrong"

House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer just issued a statement that states, “I believe that the justices got it wrong.”

He added, “Even if his actions have been declared constitutional, that does not mean they are right or they are in our nation’s best interest.”

**Read his full statement**:

“I believe that the justices got it wrong in this case.President Trump made it very clear that his intention in imposing a draconian travel ban was to prevent Muslims from coming into the United States.This travel ban is part of a pattern we’ve come to see with this President – a concerted effort to close America off from the world, to retreat behind walls and shuttered borders and to advantage certain groups of Americans over others.Even if his actions have been declared constitutional, that does not mean they are right or they are in our nation’s best interest.“Muslim immigrants have been a part of making America a stronger, safer, and more prosperous nation for generations.The President’s travel ban will not only weaken our nation by denying us talented immigrant workers and job creators and limiting the opportunity for foreign businesspeople to invest in America, it will also make us less safe by handing terrorist groups like ISIS a potent recruiting and radicalization tool.I urge the President to end this ban and work with Congress to ensure that our immigration and travel system is fair and smart.”

Protesters are chanting "No ban, no wall!" outside the Supreme Court

 From CNN's Saba Hamedy 

There is a rally in front of the Supreme Court following this morning’s court decision upholding President Trump’s travel ban.

Protesters outside of the court are holding signs — at least one read “Build Bridges, not Walls — and chanting, “No ban, no wall!”

Farhana Khera, the executive director of Muslim Advocates, which organized at least one of the protests, called the ruling a “disappointment” but vowed that the group would keep fighting.

“The President may have won this round but we are now moving on to next round because we know this is part of a broader battle against Trumps’ bigoted, agenda not only against Muslims but all black and brown communities,” Khera told CNN.

Department of Homeland Security: Trump's actions protect the American people
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Following the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold President Trump’s travel ban, the Department of Homeland Security called the ban a “critically important executive action” that takes “important steps to protect the American people.”

“The Department of Homeland Security will continue to faithfully execute our country’s immigration laws and treat everyone we encounter humanely and with professionalism,” the department said in a statement.

**Here’s the full statement:**

Supreme Court justice dissents: It is wrong to ignore Trump's "charged statements about Muslims"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Image 24: Sonia Sotomayor, an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, looks up while wearing glasses and standing in front of an American flag](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/29326318-eb6b-4bc1-b18f-8363e5f6052d.jpg?q=h_619,w_1100,x_0,y_0/w_1280/f_avif)

Justice Sonia Sotomayor, in a [blistering dissent](https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/26/politics/travel-ban-supreme-court/index.html), said the court was wrong to ignore Trump’s various comments.

“The majority here completely sets aside the President’s charged statements about Muslims as irrelevant,” she wrote.

“That holding erodes the foundational principles of religious tolerance that the court elsewhere has so emphatically protected, and it tells members of minority religions in our country ‘that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community.’”

She also compared today’s opinion to one that came down in 1944 in which the court blessed the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.

Reacting to the dissent, Chief Justice John Roberts took the unusual step to declare that the 1944 case, _Korematsu vs United States,_ was no longer good law and was wrongly decided.

**Important note**: This is the first time the Supreme Court has ever made this public determination.

President Trump called the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold his travel ban a “tremendous victory” for Americans and the US constitution.

In a statement, Trump called it a “vindication” — a word one White House used when describing to CNN Trump’s feeling about the ruling.

“This ruling is also a moment of profound vindication following months of hysterical commentary from the media and Democratic politicians who refuse to do what it takes to secure our border and our country,” Trump’s statement read.

Travel ban ruling a “miscarriage of justice” says Muslim civil rights group
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Chicago office of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (a Muslim civil rights and advocacy group) just sent us a statement condemning the Supreme Court decision upholding the travel ban.

“**This is a miscarriage of justice**,” CAIR-Chicago Deputy Director and counsel Sufyan Sohel said, adding, “The Supreme Court had an opportunity to remind this country that all of us, regardless of where we were born, what we look like, or how we pray, are welcome, and they failed. This ban was inspired by – and remains – contrary to the values of freedom and equality that are central to who we aspire to be as a nation.”

Democrat Rep. Keith Ellison, the first Muslim elected to Congress, just spoke to CNN and reacted to the Supreme Court’s ruling upholding Trump’s travel ban.

The Supreme Court has said, “as long [Trump] puts a very thin veneer of national security on top of all that discrimination and racism, they will buy it. In other words, as long as a pig has some lipstick on it, it’s fine,” Ellison said.

He added, “A gloating braggart is not going to win at the end of the day. I have deep faith, the best impulses of this country are about liberty, are about equality, are about religious liberty and freedom…we will prevail.”

Cory Booker on travel ban ruling: "We need to reclaim our values"
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Reacting to the Supreme Court’s decision to uphold President Trump’s travel ban, Sen. Cory Booker said the US needs to “reclaim” its values.

Booker recently got back to Washington after a trip to the US border, which is grappling with fallout from a Trump administration policy that forced some immigrant families to be separated.

“This stems from a person that started their campaign talking about Mexicans and Muslims and, in a way that just disappoints me,” Booker said, referring to President Trump.“I’m just coming back from the border.I’m still emotionally raw with what I saw down there and, you know, we need to reclaim our values.”

Travel industry: White House must make it clear that "legitimate business and leisure travelers" are welcome here
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

U.S. Travel Association Executive Vice President for Public Affairs Jonathan Grella just sent CNN the following statement, calling on the White House to make clear that “legitimate business and leisure travelers” are welcome in the US despite the ban.

He also said that the “economic stakes” are too high for “the welcome message” to be overlooked.

**Here’s his full statement:**

“Now that the U.S. court system has set guidelines for the president’s executive orders on immigration, we are hopeful that a coherent and durable set of policies can be put into place by the administration.”Today’s decision should enable the White House to move on to a new messaging phase: making it clear that keeping bad actors out remains a priority, but making it equally clear that legitimate business and leisure travelers are as welcome and desired as ever in the United States.”The economic stakes around strong and healthy international travel are too high—and speak too squarely to the president’s priorities of growing exports, jobs, and the GDP—for the welcome message not to become a featured part of the administration’s calculus.”

Amnesty International: Travel ban "has no place in a country that claims to value human rights"

Human rights organization Amnesty International just sent us its reaction to the Supreme Court’s ruling on Trump’s travel ban.

Ryan Mace, Grassroots Advocacy & Refugee Specialist at Amnesty International USA, called it a “hateful policy” that “has no place in a country that claims to value human rights.”

**Here’s the**[**full statement**](https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/amnesty-international-usa-reaction-to-supreme-court-ruling-on-muslim-ban/):

“This hateful policy is a catastrophe all around – not only for those who simply want to travel, work, or study here in the States, but for those seeking safety from violence as well. While this decision doesn’t address the separate and equally harmful ban on refugees, it cruelly traps people in conflict-afflicted countries and prevents them from seeking safety in the U.S. or being reunited with family.Some of the people banned from this policy are fleeing conflicts that the United States has had a direct hand in creating or perpetuating, as is the case in Yemen and Syria. In those cases especially we are essentially lighting a house on fire and locking the escape door shut. **This ban, and the anti-Muslim sentiment in which it originated, has no place in a country that claims to value human rights**.”

Democratic senator: Just because it's constitutional, "doesn't mean that it's right"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sen. Chris Coons, a Democrat from Delaware who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, slammed Trump’s travel ban in the wake of the Supreme Court decision, calling the measure “discriminatory and counterproductive.”

The Supreme Court may have ruled that the President’s travel ban was technically constitutional, but that doesn’t mean that it’s right, that it’s justified, or that it reflects America’s values,” Coons said in a statement.

**Here’s the rest of his statement:**

“In the coming weeks, I plan to introduce legislation to make clear that in the United States, we will not tolerate discrimination based on religion or nationality, and I invite everyone who treasures our American values to join me in defending them. **The President’s travel ban is not only discriminatory and counterproductive; it stands in direct contrast to the principles embedded in our Constitution and our founders’ vision of a nation where all people are free to worship as they choose.**With time, we have made our union more perfect by fighting discrimination in all of its forms, but the Court’s decision today demonstrates that we have a long way to go before we live up to our highest ideals.”

Blumenthal on travel ban ruling: "This opinion is by no means the end of this story"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CNN

CNN’s Manu Raju caught up with Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, to get his reaction to the Supreme Court ruling.

Here’s what the Senator said:

“This nation needs better legislation that will protect us, but uphold our essential liberties. I’m going to review the opinion and see where we should go at this point. **Clearly this opinion is by no means the end of this story**. It is no solution to either our security or our constitutional issues.”

He added:

“There is no question, there has to be legislation to protect our essential liberties, our image around the world, which is very much at risk and at stake here. The **Congress now has work to do. It cannot simply allow the courts to determine or the president what our future is in this area**. There now needs to be legislation. The onus is on us to protect liberties that may be jeopardized by rash or impulsive presidential action and we have an obligation to legislate.”

Trump sees this ruling as "vindication," White House official says
------------------------------------------------------------------

The White House hasn’t released an official statement about the Supreme Court’s travel ban ruling, and the President hasn’t commented — on Twitter or otherwise — on it.

But at least White House official tells CNN the President sees this as “vindication.”

The White House counsel’s office is briefing Trump on the ruling right now.

3 key quotes from the travel ban ruling
---------------------------------------

![Image 35: US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts ](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ded6534f-2fdd-49c8-9b6c-f01fd11137bd.jpg?q=h_3000,w_2295,x_0,y_0/w_1280/f_avif)

US Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts

We’re still reading through the Supreme Court’s travel ban ruling, but here are three key quotes from Chief Justice John Roberts’ majority opinion that already stand out:

*    “The Proclamation is squarely within the scope of Presidential authority under the INA [Immigration and Nationality Act]. **Indeed, neither dissent even attempts any serious argument to the contrary**, despite the fact that plaintiffs’ primary contention below and in their briefing before this Court was that the Proclamation violated the statute.” 
*   “The President of the United States **possesses an extraordinary power** to speak to his fellow citizens and on their behalf.” 
*    “Plaintiffs argue that this President’s words strike at fundamental standards of respect and tolerance, in violation of our constitutional tradition. **But the issue before us is not whether to denounce the statements**. It is instead the significance of those statements in reviewing a Presidential directive, neutral on its face, addressing a matter within the core of executive responsibility. In doing so, we must consider not only the statements of a particular President, but also the authority of the Presidency itself.”

Supreme Court upholds the Trump travel ban
------------------------------------------

The Supreme Court **upheld the legality** of the latest version of President Trump’s travel ban holding that **the President was within his authority** when he blocked travel from certain Muslim Majority countries.
