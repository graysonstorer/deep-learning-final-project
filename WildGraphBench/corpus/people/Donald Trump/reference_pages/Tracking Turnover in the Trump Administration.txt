**Editor's note:**

Because Donald Trump’s tenure in the White House has ended, this page will no longer be updated. It will remain in its current state as a resource for historical data.

The rate of turnover among senior-level advisers to President Trump has generated a great deal of attention. Below, we offer two sets of resources to help measure and contextualize this turnover. The first set of resources tracks turnover among senior-ranking advisers in the executive office of the president (which does not include Cabinet secretaries); [the second set of resources](https://www.brookings.edu/research/tracking-turnover-in-the-trump-administration/#cabinet) tracks turnover in the Cabinet.

A Team Turnover

Turnover on President Trump's “A Team”
--------------------------------------

President Trump’s “A Team” turnover is 92% as of January 20, 2021

The following chart and table reflect turnover among the most influential positions within the executive office of the president. This data is compiled and tracked by Brookings visiting fellow [Kathryn Dunn Tenpas](https://www.brookings.edu/experts/kathryn-dunn-tenpas-ph-d/), who refers to this group of advisers as the president’s “A Team.” The list of positions that make up the “A Team” is based on National Journal “Decision Makers” editions, and Dunn Tenpas’s methodology is described in detail in a [report](https://www.brookings.edu/research/why-is-trumps-staff-turnover-higher-than-the-5-most-recent-presidents/) she published in January 2018. The chart and table below will be updated as additional members of the “A Team” depart their positions. It is important to note the following:

*   Because the “A Team” is made up of members of the executive office of the president, it does not include Cabinet secretaries.
*   Each position on the “A Team” is only counted once. If multiple people hold and depart from the same position (e.g., communications director), only the initial departure is tracked/affects the turnover rate. For more information on these instances, see the [“serial turnover” section below](https://www.brookings.edu/research/tracking-turnover-in-the-trump-administration/#serial1).

### **Summary and analysis of “A Team” turnover in the Trump administration**

Set out below is a list of the senior level departures from the executive office of the president since the beginning of the Trump administration (each of the 65 “A Team” positions is only counted once toward the turnover rate, thus, this chart only includes the first person to hold/depart a given position). “ST” indicates a position that went through multiple instances of turnover; [see below for more details](https://www.brookings.edu/research/tracking-turnover-in-the-trump-administration/#serial1).

| SUMMARY: 60/65 (92%) “A Team” positions have turned over. |
| --- |
| * Author’s note: The departure status was difficult to determine in some cases because media reports were often at odds with an individual’s claim that they were resigning. In the end, the category “resigned under pressure” was created to capture the general sentiment at the time of their departure. "(ST)" indicates a position that went through multiple instances of turnover; see the “Serial turnover” section below for more details. |
| ** Author’s note: Anthony Scaramucci was communications director for 11 days. He was succeeded by Hope Hicks, who resigned Feb. 28, 2018. On July 5, 2018, Bill Shine was appointed to the White House communications director role with a slightly different official title, “Assistant to the President and Deputy Chief of Staff for Communications”; he resigned on March 8, 2019. Stephanie Grisham subsequently took over both the communications director and press secretary roles. |
| *** Author’s note: After Thomas Bossert’s departure, incoming National Security Adviser John Bolton folded the position of “AP for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism” into the National Security Council with the new title of “Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor.” |

Serial turnover within the Trump “A Team”
-----------------------------------------

[](https://www.brookings.edu/research/tracking-turnover-in-the-trump-administration/)The turnover data above include only the president’s initial team of advisers and when one departs, the position falls out of the sample. One of the limitations of this approach is that it does not consider multiple departures within a single position, a common phenomenon within the Trump team. Set out below are the “A Team” positions that have had more than two occupants.

### _**45% of President Trump’s “A Team” departures have undergone serial turnover as of January 20, 2021**_

| Position | Original | Replacement 1 | Replacement 2 | Replacement 3 | Replacement 4 | Replacement 5 | Replacement 6 |

| Deputy Director of the Domestic Policy Council and Director of Budget Policy | Paul Winfree | Lance Leggitt | Jenniver Bardley Lichter |  |  |  |  |

| SUMMARY: 27/60 (45%) “A Team” departures have turned over twice or more. |
| --- |
| * Author's note: For the purposes of this study, we count Michael Dubke as the first communications director, since Sean Spicer was serving in a temporary capacity until the Trump administration filled the job with a permanent candidate. |
| ** Author's note: Notice that there are multiple deputies under the chief of staff and White House counsel. The data reflect an attempt to track just a single deputy position and note the successor. However, there is minimal publicly available information on presidential staffing. It is also the case that a new chief of staff may not have a “first among equals” deputy chief of staff, such that the role may have changed since the original occupant. The same is true for White House Counsel. While Greg Katsas may have been the “first among equals” among the Deputy White House Counsel positions in 2017, the role may have changed under the new White House Counsel, Pat Cipollone. |
| *** Author's note: Upon the departure of former Deputy National Security Adviser Charles Kupperman, National Security Adviser Robert C. O'Brien divided the duties of that position between Matthew Pottinger and Victoria Coates. On Feb. 20, 2020, the National Security Council said that Coates had left the position and been reassigned as a senior adviser to Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette; on Jan. 7, reports indicated that Pottinger had resigned (https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/06/politics/national-security-adviser-resigns-trump-protest/index.html). |

Cabinet Turnover

Turnover in President Trump's Cabinet
-------------------------------------

The chart and table below are dedicated to tracking turnover in the Cabinet. They will also be updated as additional turnover occurs. Unlike the trackers above dedicated to the president’s “A Team,” these resources look at every departure from the president’s Cabinet, even if multiple people have occupied that position.

### _Notice of updated methodology_

The current table of Cabinet-level turnover has been updated from a previous version, [accessible here for reference](https://www.brookings.edu/research/appendix-archive-version-of-brookingss-white-house-turnover-tracker/), that was based on a different methodology; this change was made on May 21, 2019. This newer table provides data going back to President Reagan (1981) and adheres to a strict definition of Cabinet by only including the heads of the executive departments. While presidents often promote a position like EPA administrator to Cabinet-level status, these appointments are ad hoc, can be short-lived, and make it difficult to compare over time. Given the variability, we only include Senate-confirmed Cabinet members who are in the presidential line of succession, since this allows for greater consistency and standardization. More information on this update is available in [a piece on Brookings’s FixGov blog](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2019/05/21/who-is-in-the-presidents-cabinet/). Additionally, since Reagan’s presidency, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Homeland Security have been added to the list (increasing from 13 to 15 positions). Year of departure is determined by the date a Cabinet member announced they were resigning, regardless of their final end date.

### **Summary and analysis of Cabinet departures in the Trump administration**

Set out below is a list of departures from the president’s Cabinet since the beginning of the Trump administration.
