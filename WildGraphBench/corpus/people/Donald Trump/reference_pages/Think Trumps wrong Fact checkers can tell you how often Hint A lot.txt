No, Donald Trump, the unemployment rate isn't [42 percent](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/251568-trump-real-unemployment-rate-is-42-percent). And, no, it's not true that President Obama wants to take in [250,000 Syrian refugees](http://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/texas-politics/politifact/article/Trump-says-Obama-wants-to-bring-250-000-Syrian-6670286.php). Or that ["thousands and thousands"](http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/11/trump_thousands_in_jersey_city_cheered_on_911.html)of American Muslims celebrated when the World Trade towers toppled on 9/11. Despite numerous accounts to the contrary, Trump has insisted on all these things.
