Topline
-------

Former President Donald Trump on Monday announced he’ll begin to use the term “the big lie” –commonly used by his critics to describe his baseless election fraud claims –to refer to the 2020 election results, a sign he has no plans to tone down his rhetoric as one social media platform adjudicates his suspension.

ORLANDO, FLORIDA - FEBRUARY 28: Former U.S. President Donald Trump addresses the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) held in the Hyatt Regency on February 28, 2021 in Orlando, Florida.

Key Facts

In a statement sent through his political action committee, Save America PAC, Trump incorrectly blasted his [loss in November](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2020/11/07/joe-biden-wins-presidency-after-recapturing-rust-belt-states/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2020/11/07/joe-biden-wins-presidency-after-recapturing-rust-belt-states/") as “The Fraudulent Presidential Election of 2020” and said it “will be, from this day forth, known as THE BIG LIE!”

As Trump has mounted his return to the spotlight, he has again [become increasingly vocal](https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/02/17/trump-is-back-to-falsely-claiming-the-election-was-stolen-from-him/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewsolender/2021/02/17/trump-is-back-to-falsely-claiming-the-election-was-stolen-from-him/") about his unfounded fraud claims, putting out statement after statement in recent days about an [Arizona election audit](https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2021/04/29/theyre-still-counting-but-heres-why-arizonas-election-recount-is-causing-concern/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/nicholasreimann/2021/04/29/theyre-still-counting-but-heres-why-arizonas-election-recount-is-causing-concern/") many onlookers have [labeled dubious](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/05/02/cindy-mccain-slams-arizona-republicans-for-ludicrous-election-recount/ "https://www.forbes.com/sites/jemimamcevoy/2021/05/02/cindy-mccain-slams-arizona-republicans-for-ludicrous-election-recount/").

Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), the No. 3 ranking House Republican and a vocal Trump critic, [shot back on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Liz_Cheney/status/1389225154639695881?s=20 "https://twitter.com/Liz_Cheney/status/1389225154639695881?s=20") that the election “was not stolen,” adding, “Anyone who claims it was is spreading THE BIG LIE” and “poisoning our democratic system.”

But this latest development comes as Facebook [announced](https://thehill.com/policy/technology/551430-facebook-oversight-board-to-rule-on-trump-ban-wednesday "https://thehill.com/policy/technology/551430-facebook-oversight-board-to-rule-on-trump-ban-wednesday") Monday it would decide the fate of Trump’s account, which was suspended after his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6 based on his fraud claims, on Wednesday.

Trump has claimed he is better off without social media, particularly Twitter, calling his press releases [more “elegant” than tweets](https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-says-his-elegant-press-releases-are-better-than-twitter-2021-4 "https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-says-his-elegant-press-releases-are-better-than-twitter-2021-4") and arguing Twitter has “[become totally BORING](https://www.newsweek.com/trump-claims-boring-twitter-losing-users-platform-gains-millions-them-1588051 "https://www.newsweek.com/trump-claims-boring-twitter-losing-users-platform-gains-millions-them-1588051")” even as he tried to [tag a right-wing news network](https://twitter.com/AndrewSolender/status/1388239945907703809?s=20 "https://twitter.com/AndrewSolender/status/1388239945907703809?s=20") in a recent statement.
