President Trump has promised a “colorblind and merit-based” society, while also equating diversity with incompetence.

As Navy divers searched the Potomac River for bodies from the worst air crash in the United States in 20 years, President Trump zeroed in on what he saw as the cause: hiring programs that promote diversity.

The meaning behind his words was clear, that [diversity equals incompetence](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/30/us/politics/trump-plane-crash-dei-faa-diversity.html). And for many historians, civil rights leaders, scholars and citizens, it was an unmistakable message of racism in plain sight at the highest levels of American government.

“His attacks on diversity, equity and inclusion aren’t about a particular program or some acronym — they’re just a sanitized substitute for the racist comments that can no longer be spoken openly,” Margaret Huang, the Southern Poverty Law Center’s president and chief executive, said during a call with civil rights leaders after Mr. Trump’s remarks. “But the message is the same, that women, ​Black and brown communities are inherently less capable, and if they hold positions of power or authority in government or business, it must be because the standards were lowered.​”

In the weeks since he took office, Mr. Trump has made a point of [purging the federal government](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/22/us/politics/trump-order-discrimination-federal-hiring.html) of D.E.I. initiatives in order to usher in what he called a “colorblind and merit-based” society. He even said his executive order eliminating the programs was “the most important [federal civil rights](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-protects-civil-rights-and-merit-based-opportunity-by-ending-illegal-dei/) measure in decades.”

In his actions, Mr. Trump has aligned himself with those who are brandishing the term D.E.I. as a catchall for discrimination against white people, and using it as a pejorative to attack nonwhite and female leaders as unqualified for their positions. After some of Mr. Trump’s allies in Congress disparagingly referred to Vice President Kamala Harris as a “[D.E.I. hire](https://x.com/JoshRultNews/status/1815857063819456850)” during the 2024 campaign, Mr. Trump [refused to disavow the remarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVGJP1zkGQE).

The issue plays into deep tensions among Americans about the role of race in society and helped supercharge Mr. Trump’s political comeback. Many voters, conservative and not, hoped to see a correction to what they saw as progressive politics gone too far.
