*   June 20, 2016

The future Mrs. [Donald J. Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/21/us/politics/donald-trump-money-campaign.html) was puzzled.

She had been summoned to a lunch meeting with her husband-to-be and his lawyer to review a prenuptial agreement. It required that, should the couple split, she return everything — cars, furs, rings — that Mr. Trump might give her during their marriage.

Sensing her sorrow, Mr. Trump apologized, Ivana Trump later testified in a divorce deposition. He said it was his lawyer’s idea.

“It is just one of those Roy Cohn numbers,” Mr. Trump told her.

The year was 1977, and Mr. Cohn’s reputation was well established. He had been [Senator Joseph McCarthy](http://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/02/dec-2-1954-anti-communist-senator-joseph-mccarthy-is-condemned/)’s Red-baiting consigliere. He had [helped send the Rosenbergs](http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/tu_rosenberg_bio_cohn.html) to the electric chair for spying and elect Richard M. Nixon president.

Then New York’s most feared lawyer, Mr. Cohn had a client list that ran the gamut from the disreputable to the quasi-reputable: [Anthony (Fat Tony) Salerno](http://www.nytimes.com/1992/07/29/us/anthony-fat-tony-salerno-80-a-top-crime-boss-dies-in-prison.html), [Claus von Bulow](http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20085834,00.html), [George Steinbrenner](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/sports/baseball/14steinbrenner.html).

But there was one client who occupied a special place in Roy Cohn’s famously cold heart: Donald J. Trump.

For Mr. Cohn, who [died of AIDS in 1986](https://partners.nytimes.com/library/national/science/aids/080386sci-aids.html), weeks after being disbarred for flagrant ethical violations, Mr. Trump was something of a final project. If Fred Trump got his son’s career started, bringing him into the family business of middle-class rentals in Brooklyn and Queens, Mr. Cohn ushered him across the river and into Manhattan, introducing him to the social and political elite while ferociously defending him against a growing list of enemies.
