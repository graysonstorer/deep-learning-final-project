Valerie Martinez-Ebers

During an interview with CBS’s “Face the Nation” this past Sunday, [Sen. Tim Kaine](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/17/kaine-trump-white-nationalists-klobuchar-1224199) (D-Va.) lambasted President Trump for emboldening white nationalism after [a young man killed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/lets-get-this-party-started-new-zealand-gunman-narrated-his-chilling-rampage/2019/03/15/fb3db352-4748-11e9-90f0-0ccfeec87a61_story.html) at least 50 people at two New Zealand mosques. Kaine was referring to Trump’s answer after a reporter asked whether he sees "today that white nationalism is a rising threat around the world?” Trump [responded](https://www.cnn.com/2019/03/16/politics/fact-checking-trump-on-threat-of-white-nationalism/index.html), “I don’t really.”
