Jan. 21, 2025, 12:44 AM UTC/Updated Jan. 21, 2025, 4:45 PM UTC

By [Ryan J. Reilly](https://www.nbcnews.com/author/ryan-j-reilly-ncpn1288345)

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday issued roughly 1,500 pardons and commuted the sentences of 14 of his supporters in connection with the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, when thousands of them stormed the building amid his false claims that the 2020 presidential election was rigged against him.

Trump commuted the sentences of individuals associated with the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, who were convicted of seditious conspiracy. He then issued "a full, complete and unconditional pardon to all other individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021," a category that included people who assaulted law enforcement officers.

"This is a big one," Trump said in the Oval Office while signing the document, adding, "We hope they come out tonight, frankly."

The family of Enrique Tarrio, the Proud Boys leader convicted of seditious conspiracy, said in a media statement Tuesday that he was released late Monday from FCI Pollock, a medium-security federal prison in Louisiana, and expected to arrive in Miami on Tuesday.

Tarrio was serving 22 years in federal prison after he was convicted of seditious conspiracy.

Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who was speaker of the House during the attack, called Trump's actions "an outrageous insult to our justice system" and the law enforcement officers who protected the Capitol that day.

"It is shameful that the President has decided to make one of his top priorities the abandonment and betrayal of police officers who put their lives on the line to stop an attempt to subvert the peaceful transfer of power," she said in a statement. "Despite the President’s decision, we must always remember the extraordinary courage and valor of the law enforcement heroes who stood in the breach and ensured that democracy survived on that dark day.”

The pardons fulfill one of Trump's central campaign promises.

Immediately after the Jan. 6 attack, Trump sought to distance himself from the attack, saying those who broke the law should be held accountable. But over the next few years, a new narrative emerged, and Trump soon began openly signaling his support for Jan. 6 rioters, calling them "[hostages](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-republicans-jan-6-hostages-violence-capitol-police-rcna143888)."

The unprecedented attack on the Capitol, when the peaceful transfer of power was interrupted, was one of the most significant moments in American history.

[Trump pardons Jan. 6 defendants: Will there be political backlash?](https://www.today.com/video/trump-pardons-jan-6-defendants-will-there-be-political-backlash-229833797860)

It resulted in the largest FBI investigation ever, with criminal charges against more than 1,500 people and criminal convictions against more than 1,100 defendants. Many low-level riot defendants were sentenced to probationary periods after having been convicted of misdemeanor offenses, like unlawful parading inside the Capitol.

But hundreds of others who committed serious felonies, such as assaulting police with deadly or dangerous weapons, got significant prison sentences.

At the time Trump issued the pardons, there were about 700 defendants who either never received prison sentences or had already completed their sentences, meaning pardons or commutations would have little practical impact on them, beyond restoring voting rights and gun rights for those who were convicted of felonies.

More than 600 people were sentenced to incarceration, but only a small fraction of them are still behind bars. Many of those who are in the custody of the federal Bureau of Prisons were convicted of violent attacks on police officers protecting the Capitol during an assault in which Jan. 6 defendants were armed with[firearms](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-supporter-charged-firing-gun-jan-6-attack-ordered-detained-rcna143217),[stun guns](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/jan-6-rioter-electroshocked-dc-officer-michael-fanone-sentenced-125-ye-rcna89388), [flagpoles](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/ex-nypd-cop-assaulted-dc-officer-jan-6-gets-record-setting-sentence-rcna45338), [fire extinguishers](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/first-jan-6-rioter-breach-capitol-2020-election-lies-trump-rcna140798), [bike racks](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-supporter-called-capitol-cops-weasels-jan-6-sentenced-prison-rcna42865), [batons](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/fbi-arrests-jan-6-rioter-confessed-front-courthouse-rcna100455), a[metal whip](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/jan-6-rioter-nabbed-bumble-dating-app-sting-pleads-guilty-assaulting-o-rcna130593), [office furniture](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/conservative-influencer-helped-steal-table-used-assault-officers-jan-6-rcna143908), [pepper spray](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/jan-6-rioter-heart-trump-hat-confederate-flag-gets-prison-assaults-off-rcna148840), [bear spray](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-hatted-rioter-sentenced-bear-spraying-8-officers-jan-6-rcna123792),[a tomahawk ax](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/shane-jenkins-trump-supporter-jan-6-riot-prison-7-years-rcna119294),[a hatchet](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/ex-police-chief-spread-conspiracies-jan-6-found-guilty-capitol-attack-rcna93407),[a hockey stick](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-fan-assaulted-officers-hockey-stick-jan-6-sentenced-prison-rcna140969), [knuckle gloves](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/stun-guns-stinger-whips-crossbow-what-police-found-capitol-protesters-n1254127), [a baseball bat](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-republicans-jan-6-hostages-violence-capitol-police-rcna143888),[a massive “Trump” billboard](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-fan-assaulted-capitol-cops-trump-flag-billboard-jan-6-gets-priso-rcna44988), [“Trump” flags](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/jan-6-rioter-holding-stop-steal-sign-swung-officers-trump-flag-fbi-say-rcna142335), a[pitchfork](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/missouri-man-sentenced-prison-assaulting-law-enforcement-during-jan-6-capitol-breach),[pieces of lumber](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/jan-6-rioter-wielded-2x4-wooden-plank-capitol-sentenced-nearly-3-years-rcna122589),[crutches](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/re-gonna-die-tonight-trump-fan-admits-dragging-cop-capitol-steps-rcna47737)and[even an explosive device](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-republicans-jan-6-hostages-violence-capitol-police-rcna143888).

More than 140 police officers were injured and several Trump supporters died during the attack, including one who was shot trying to breach the House Speaker's Lobby and another who died in the middle of a brutal battle at the lower west tunnel, where some of the worst violence of the day took place.

Trump did not speak about Jan. 6 in his inauguration address, in which he said he hoped he would someday be remembered as a "peacemaker and unifier."

But shortly thereafter, he spoke to an overflow crowd of supporters in the Capitol and addressed the Jan. 6 defendants, once again airing his baseless claim that the 2020 presidential election was "rigged."

"I was going to talk about the J6 hostages," Trump said in that speech, [using the term "hostages" to refer to criminal defendants](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-republicans-jan-6-hostages-violence-capitol-police-rcna143888), including hundreds who admitted to their criminal offenses under oath and others who were convicted by either judges or juries of their peers. "But you’ll be happy because, you know, it’s action, not words, that count. And you’re going to see a lot of action on the J6 hostages."

An attorney who worked on Jan. 6 cases as a federal prosecutor told NBC News that it was always possible that Trump would return to power and pardon Capitol riot defendants but that the Justice Department "pressed ahead anyway" because "political considerations should not play any part in the Justice Department’s evaluation of facts and law, which showed that these were crimes — some of them terribly serious crimes — that warranted prosecution.”

The source said that they and, they suspected, many of their colleagues "have no regrets about having pursued these cases" and that the effort remains highly consequential because it created "a definitive, public factual record of what actually transpired" on Jan. 6.

"These cases assured police officers and civilians who were assaulted at the Capitol that there were people, and there was a Department of Justice, who recognized what they endured and sacrificed. These cases led to hundreds of defendants' acknowledging their crimes by pleading guilty in open court and hundreds of others' being found guilty at trial," the source said."The work is likely be terminated before it can be fully completed, most significantly by the abrupt termination of the special counsel’s work.But the record stands."
