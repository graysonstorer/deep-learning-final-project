[President Trump](https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump) is setting a new precedent for tight, punitive government control over a free press.

**Why it matters:** Trump and his administration are doing this systematically, gleefully and unmistakably. But as we've [written before](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/02/trump-payback-democrats-executive-orders), this unprecedented shift could set the precedent for future Democratic presidents, too.

**The big picture:**Trump frames this as payback for what he calls [incompetent](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113963121926787410), [left-wing](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/113956778707659340) coverage, and the White House says it's expanding access to [new voices and outlets](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1894470524857614825). The White House Correspondents' Association [says](https://whca.press/2025/02/25/whca-statement-on-white-house-announcement-on-press-pool/) he's tearing "at the independence of a free press in the United States."

*   The end result is twofold: much tighter control over media, and new tools and tactics to punish critics.

**Here is what's different today** than 38 days ago:

1.   **Lawsuits.** Before taking office, Trump sued [ABC News](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/18/us/politics/trump-lawsuit-abc-stephanopoulos.html), [CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-sues-cbs-news-60-minutes-interview/) and a former [Des Moines Register pollster](https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2025/02/25/dismissal-sought-donald-trump-lawsuit-pollster-ann-selzer-des-moines-register-iowa-poll/79442387007/) over coverage. This is a new technique for a president or former president — and one getting results. ABC agreed to [pay $15 million](https://apnews.com/article/abc-trump-lawsuit-defamation-stephanopoulos-04aea8663310af39ae2a85f4c1a56d68) to Trump's future presidential library instead of fighting in court. CBS also appears to be [heading toward settling](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/24/business/media/paramount-trump-60-minutes-lawsuit-cbs.html). Hard to see how this doesn't encourage more lawsuits and entice future presidents pissed off about coverage to do the same.
2.   **Blacklists.**Trump barred AP from the Oval Office and Air Force One for refusing to use "Gulf of America" instead of "Gulf of Mexico" after he made the change by decree. AP, a global newswire that writes the stylebook most U.S. media outlets follow, has been a pillar of White House coverage for [more than a century](https://apnews.com/article/trump-gulf-mexico-america-ap-first-amendment-4304433d73ad496f5308c9666cbe8e11). Denying access, and mandating word choices, are new tactics for a president. Imagine a Democratic president renaming it the Gulf of Obama — and targeting Fox News for refusing to call it that. Fox and the conservative Newsmax were [among the outlets](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/20/business/media/ap-white-house-ban-cnn-fox.html) protesting AP retribution. Jacqui Heinrich — Fox News senior White House correspondent, and a White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA) board member — [wrote on X](https://x.com/jacquiheinrich/status/1894571309981446606): "This is a short-sighted decision, and it will feel a lot different when a future Democratic administration kicks out conservative-leaning outlets and other critical voices."
3.   **Stacking the deck.**For decades, until Tuesday, the White House had little say in the choice of media organizations responsible for covering official actions and trips via what's known as the [press pool](https://whca.press/covering-the-white-house/resources/guide-to-the-white-house-beat/). In response to AP's [suit over access](https://apnews.com/article/ap-lawsuit-trump-gulf-mexico-america-6b6fba488e7e420e5fcd28c44a755922), the White House [seized control of this process](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/white-house-takes-control-press-pool-covering-trump-2025-02-25/), [formerly run](https://whca.press/2025/02/25/whca-statement-on-white-house-announcement-on-press-pool/) by the White House Correspondents' Association. Trump has promised to keep [traditional media companies](https://x.com/taylor47/status/1894535309368463530) part of the mix. But if the new system holds, he and future presidents could surround themselves with friendly reporters asking friendly questions — and punish those who don't.
4.   **Shielding Cabinet officials.**At the Pentagon, where reporters both work onsite and serve in a rotating pool that travels with the SecDef, a similar purge has unfolded. First, the Pentagon booted NBC News, the N.Y. Times, Politico and NPR from their physical workspace as part of [a new](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/01/pentagon-removes-major-media-outlets-including-nbc-news-from-dedicated-workstations-in-new-rotation-program.html) "annual media rotation program" — [substituting friendly outlets](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/01/business/media/pentagon-press-corps.html) + HuffPost, which had no Pentagon reporter. A week later, CNN [was ousted](https://apnews.com/article/pentagon-reporters-ejected-press-room-trump-administration-359d22d77ee22cb0f256170f8f67178c) from its workspace. Good riddance, MAGA supporters say. But will a future Democratic president do unto conservative news sources as the Trump administration has done to the legacy media?

**Behind the scenes:**[Taylor Budowich](https://x.com/Taylor47), a White House deputy chief of staff intimately involved in this process, told us there's more at play here, and insisted the moves aren't motivated by suppressing dissent. The White House feels access to limited areas like the Oval Office and Air Force One shouldn't be guaranteed to a select few legacy outlets — but instead should be opened up to include both MAGA voices, and other new or niche nonpartisan publications with more domain expertise.

*   Budowich said the goal is to drive a "ratings bonanza" by leveraging the reach of traditional outlets with the fresh approach of some newer media players. "The established process doesn't serve people well," he said. "We want to provide more opportunities ... for those who want to do things differently."
*   A New York Times [statement](https://x.com/NYTimesPR/status/1894533773275849118) Tuesday evening called the White House's move "an effort to undermine the public's access to independent, trustworthy information about the most powerful person in America."

**The Axios approach:**As we [wrote a week ago](https://www.axios.com/2025/02/21/jim-vandehei-axios-coverage-in-trump-era), Axios takes a clinical approach, like a doctor. We simply want to give you the facts and insights to make better decisions and live better lives.

*   But these changes curtail the free press, both now and if Trump or future presidents take it further.

**Zoom out:**[Trump allies](https://x.com/Cernovich/status/1894601640478740488) on X played up efforts by former President Biden to ensure friendly press interactions, including extremely limited press contact and [prescreening](https://www.foxnews.com/media/la-times-denies-submitting-questions-white-house-ahead-press-conference) of reporters' questions, in contrast to Trump's [freewheeling sessions](https://apnews.com/article/trump-white-house-speeches-talking-communications-094b2c5b4d5a6d1ab1fd06ade090ed4c).

*   The Biden administration [culled](https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/heritage-explains/why-the-biden-white-house-kicking-reporters-out) the list of "[hard pass"](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/west-wing-playbook/2023/08/02/simons-no-longer-got-a-hard-pass-00109526) holders with permanent credentials — access the Trump team [says it's restoring](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1894568402087301300).

**The bottom line:**Tough questions, serious scrutiny, free thought, transparent access to key historical moments. These are decades-long precedents that keep the public informed.
