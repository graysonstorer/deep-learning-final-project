President-elect Donald Trump is 11 days away from his second term in the White House.

In his [headline-grabbing](https://www.usnews.com/news/u-s-news-decision-points/articles/2025-01-08/greenland-and-the-panama-canal-trump-has-your-attention-now), wide-ranging press conference this week, [Donald Trump](https://www.usnews.com/topics/people/donald_trump)repeated his common claim about his first term in the White House, asserting that “we had the greatest economy in history.”

Except: not really.

In fact, if Trump is looking for a great [economy](https://www.usnews.com/topics/subjects/economy) to emulate as he stands 11 days away from his second term, he might well turn to the one he’s inheriting from President [Joe Biden](https://www.usnews.com/topics/people/joe_biden). The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta’s [GDPNow model](https://www.atlantafed.org/cqer/research/gdpnow) pegs the annual rate of growth in the economy at 2.7% in the last quarter of 2024, after back-to-back quarters of [3% growth or better](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product).

[### Trump Has Your Attention Now, Right? The president-elect's imperialistic hankerings are certainly a vibe.](https://www.usnews.com/news/u-s-news-decision-points/articles/2025-01-08/greenland-and-the-panama-canal-trump-has-your-attention-now)

Meanwhile, the AP offered [a helpful breakdown](https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2024-05-20/many-remember-solid-economy-under-trump-but-his-record-also-full-of-tax-cut-hype-debt-and-disease) of Trump’s economic record last year:

*   Even if COVID-19 is excluded from Trump’s record, growth averaged 2.67% on his first watch. Annual growth under Biden at the time was 3.4%.
*   The economy lost 2.7 million jobs under Trump. Again with the COVID crisis excluded, he added 6.7 million jobs. But Biden has added more than twice that number, with a few more to be counted on Friday.

The big difference, of course, is inflation, which reached 2.9% during Trump’s term yet topped 9% as COVID waned under Biden, [government data](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm) shows. That went [a long way](https://www.usnews.com/news/national-news/articles/2024-07-10/inflation-cost-of-living-the-top-election-issue-for-gen-z-millennials) to assuring Trump’s victory in November amid his promise to bring grocery prices down.

**About Those Egg Prices …**
----------------------------

Yes, they’re [still high](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/why-are-eggs-so-expensive). You can blame [bird flu](https://www.usnews.com/news/health-news/articles/2024-12-20/how-america-lost-control-of-the-bird-flu-raising-the-threat-of-another-pandemic), in part.

As Olivier [noted in this space yesterday](https://www.usnews.com/news/u-s-news-decision-points/articles/2025-01-08/greenland-and-the-panama-canal-trump-has-your-attention-now), Trump this week did acknowledge it may be “hard” to bring prices down, though he says increasing domestic energy production – which already reached [a historic record](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/03/the-u-s-has-never-produced-more-energy-than-it-does-today/) – is the answer to lowering the price of everyday goods.

Yet some economists and even the [Federal Reserve](https://www.usnews.com/news/economy/articles/2025-01-08/fed-officials-express-concern-about-inflation-and-uncertainty-over-trumps-economic-policies) question whether Trump’s smorgasbord of economic proposals – extending and increasing tax cuts, deporting millions of immigrants and applying heavy import tariffs on goods made by America’s leading trade partners – might actually do more harm than good.

**Winning vs. Governing**
-------------------------

“Winning elections is relatively easy compared to governing,” says Sevin Yeltekin, dean of the Simon Business School at the University of Rochester. “Tax cuts are just going to add more to the debt and tariffs going very high would be detrimental to the consumer.”

But Trump loves cutting taxes. In his first go-round, he cleared a roughly $2 trillion package of cuts – the benefits of which [“skewed to the rich,”](https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-tax/the-2017-trump-tax-law-was-skewed-to-the-rich-expensive-and-failed-to-deliver) as one analysis put it. Now, with some of the cuts set to expire in the coming months, Trump and his compatriots in the GOP are doubling down on extending them, which reportedly could add [upwards of $4 trillion](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/05/14/trump-tax-cuts-budget-deficit.html) to the federal debt – the same debt that Trump [back in the day vowed to get rid of](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/12/trump-vowed-eliminate-debt-years-hes-track-leave-it-least-percent-higher/).

*   Speaking of which, the yield on the 10-year Treasury has risen by almost a percentage point in the period since the Fed began cutting interest rates in September and Trump won the election, reflecting concern about the stickiness of inflation. Higher interest rates will make servicing the [$36 trillion debt](https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/americas-finance-guide/national-debt/) even harder and keep consumer borrowing costs higher for longer.

*   At the same time, plans to deport millions of immigrants who may be in the country without authorization or permanent status will likely [cause labor shortages](https://www.usnews.com/news/u-s-news-decision-points/articles/2024-11-14/how-a-trump-crackdown-on-immigrants-could-fuel-inflation) at a time when the job market has reached a balance following the disruptions from COVID.

[Fed Signals Concern Over Trump Policies](https://www.usnews.com/news/economy/articles/2025-01-08/fed-officials-express-concern-about-inflation-and-uncertainty-over-trumps-economic-policies)

Notably, London-based Capital Economics believes Trump’s tariffs won’t be as extensive or as damaging as his rhetoric might suggest. Still, the research firm sees the combination of tariffs and immigration proposals as trimming annual U.S. economic growth down to [around 1.5%](https://www.capitaleconomics.com/q1-2025-us-economic-outlook-trump-policies-will-be-mildly-stagflationary) in the 12 months following their potential enactment by mid-year.

As for inflation, the economists project that to rise to around 3%.

That could hardly be described as great.
