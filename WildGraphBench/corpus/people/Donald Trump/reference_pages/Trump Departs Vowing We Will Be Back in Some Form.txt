Defeated and twice impeached, the 45th president used his farewell remarks before a sparse crowd to brag about his record and wish luck to the incoming administration.

JOINT BASE ANDREWS, Md. — President Donald J. Trump left Washington aboard Air Force One for a final time on Wednesday, the iconic plane creeping along the runway so the liftoff was timed to the closing strains of Frank Sinatra’s “My Way.”

In many ways, Mr. Trump’s last hours as president were a bookend to [the kickoff of his presidential campaign in June 2015](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/us/politics/donald-trump-runs-for-president-this-time-for-real-he-says.html). As he did then, he tossed aside prepared remarks that aides had helped draft and spoke off the cuff, having them take down teleprompters they had set up. As he did then, he spent hours focused on the visual aspects of the scene where he would speak at the end of a calamitous final three months that capped a tumultuous term.

Before [departing for Florida](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/21/us/trump-palm-beach-florida.html), Mr. Trump — [defeated at the polls](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/us/politics/trump-approval-rating.html), [twice impeached](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/21/us/politics/trump-impeachment-trial-mcconnell-senate.html), [silenced by social media platforms](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/us/politics/trump-twitter.html) and facing an array of legal and financial problems — laid down a marker about his future, telling the roughly 300 supporters who greeted him on the windy tarmac, several holding American flags, that they had not seen the last of him.

“Goodbye. We love you. We will be back in some form,” Mr. Trump vowed, with the first lady, Melania Trump, by his side in sunglasses and a black outfit. He has yet to say what that form will take, but people who know him said he remained bitter that congressional Republicans had joined in rebuke of his speech at a Jan. 6 rally that incited his supporters to storm the Capitol.
