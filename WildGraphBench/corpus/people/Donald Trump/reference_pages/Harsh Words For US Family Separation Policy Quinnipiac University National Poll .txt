"Sad," "terrible," "bad," "wrong," are the words most frequently used by American voters to describe the practice of separating children from their parents when families try to enter the U.S. illegally, according to a Quinnipiac University National Poll released today.

In fact, the 18 words most frequently used in an open-ended question by the independent Quinnipiac (KWIN-uh-pe-ack) University National Poll, allowing for any answer, are all negative.

The top words and the number of times they were used, not percentages, are:

*    Sad - 79 times;
*    Terrible - 67 times;
*    Bad - 53 times;
*    Wrong - 47 times;
*    Disgusted - 45 times;
*    Horrible - 39 times. 

American voters disapprove 58 - 39 percent of the way President Donald Trump is handling immigration.

President Trump is racist, 49 percent of voters say, while 47 percent say he is not racist. But 50 percent of voters say the main motive for Trump's immigration policies is "a sincere interest in controlling our borders," while 44 percent say the main motive is "racist beliefs."

Democrats in Congress are more interested in "exploiting the nation's immigration issue for political gain," 60 percent of voters say, while 34 percent say they are more interested in "resolving the nation's immigration issue."

"The words are G-rated, but a punch to the gut of President Donald Trump's immigration policy," said Tim Malloy, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll.

"When it comes to the separation of immigrant kids from their parents, American voters are clearly appalled."

Separating children from their parents was a violation of human rights, American voters say 60 - 36 percent. The Trump Administration has a responsibility to unite these children with their parents, voters say 83 - 12 percent. Undocumented immigrants are not more likely than American citizens to commit crimes, American voters say 69 - 25 percent.

President Trump's Approval, Character Traits
--------------------------------------------

American voters disapprove 55 - 40 percent of the job President Trump is doing, compared to a 52 - 43 percent disapproval rating in a June 20 Quinnipiac University National Poll and reversing a trend which showed Trump's net approval inching up.

The president gets negative grades on most character traits:

*    58 - 38 percent say he is not honest;
*    55 - 43 percent say he does not have good leadership skills;
*    55 - 43 percent say he does not care about average Americans;
*    62 - 34 percent say he is not level-headed;
*    63 - 32 percent say he is a strong person;
*    57 - 39 say he is intelligent;
*    60 - 37 percent say he does not share their values;
*    62 - 36 percent say he does not provide the U.S. with moral leadership. 

Voters approve 53 - 39 percent of Trump's meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin and approve 51 - 40 percent of the way the president is handling the nation's policy toward North Korea.

Civility
--------

The lack of civility in politics is a serious problem, American voters say 91 - 7 percent. While 47 percent of voters blame Trump more for this lack of civility, 37 percent blame the Democrats more. Voters say 55 - 39 percent that Trump has emboldened people who hold racist beliefs to express those beliefs publicly.

"The latest survey warrants more low-key sparklers than soaring Roman candles as President Trump's approval stalls and voters say civility has gone out the window," Malloy said.

From June 27 - July 1, Quinnipiac University surveyed 1,020 voters nationwide, with a margin of error of +/- 3.7 percentage points, including design effect. Live interviewers call landlines and cell phones.

The Quinnipiac University Poll, directed by Douglas Schwartz, Ph.D., conducts nationwide public opinion surveys, and statewide polls in Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado and Texas as a public service and for research.
