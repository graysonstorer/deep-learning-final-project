Donald J. Trump has sold stock in one of his casinos, the Trump Plaza in Atlantic City.

The initial public offering of the company that owns the Trump Plaza and will operate any new Trump casino ventures, including one planned for a riverboat based in Gary, Ind., was priced yesterday at $14 a share for the 10-million-share offering. It will raise $130.5 million for the company after paying the underwriters, led by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.

The price was at the bottom of the range of $14 to $16 that the company, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, had been seeking. The public will own about 60 percent of the company, which owns the Trump Plaza but has no interest in his other two Atlantic City casinos, the Trump Castle and the Trump Taj Mahal. Mr. Trump will own the remaining shares.

There was no immediate announcement of pricing for an accompanying issue of $140 million in high-yield bonds. Completion of the bond deal is a prerequisite for completing the stock deal.

The shares are to begin trading today on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DJT, which, not coincidentally, are Mr. Trump's initials.

Proceeds from the two offerings are to provide some of the money needed to expand the Trump Plaza hotel and casino and build the Indiana riverboat. But the prospectuses for the offerings emphasized that more money would need to be raised.
