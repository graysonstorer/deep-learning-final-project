Donald Trump: I'd bring back 'a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding'

Ted Cruz denied practice of simulated drowning used during the Bush administration was ‘torture’ during Republican debate in New Hampshire

Donald Trump said he would “bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding”, or simulated drowning, at the [Republican debate in Manchester, New Hampshire](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/feb/06/republican-debate-new-hampshire-primary-2016-election), on Saturday.

His Republican rival [Ted Cruz](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ted-cruz), asked whether the practice notoriously used under the Bush administration during the war on terror was torture, denied it was: “Under the definition of torture, no, it’s not. It is enhanced interrogation ... It does not meet the generally recognized definition of torture.”

But the Texas senator added: “I would not bring it back in any sort of widespread use. And indeed I’d join with Senator [John] McCain in prohibiting line officers from employing it.”

Former Florida governor [Jeb Bush](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/jeb-bush) – brother of former president George W Bush, under whom waterboarding was used by the CIA – said: “It was used sparingly, Congress has changed the laws and I think where we stand is the appropriate place.”

Meanwhile, [Marco Rubio](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/marco-rubio) said it was inappropriate to discuss interrogation techniques.

The Republican candidates were debating on ABC ahead of the primary on Tuesday. Trump has a strong lead in the polls, although he lost last week’s Iowa caucuses to Cruz.

At this unsettling time
-----------------------

We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could spare 37 seconds to support our most important fundraising appeal of the year.

In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year on from his second victory, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one.

From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced.

While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts.

While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel.

**Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less.**

**But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, it means we’ll show you fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you.**
