He came of age in Queens, built Trump Tower, starred in “The Apprentice,” bankrupted his businesses six times, and drew cheering crowds and angry protesters to Fifth Avenue after his election. Through it all, President Trump — rich, bombastic and to many Americans the epitome of a New Yorker — was intertwined with the city he called his lifelong home.

No longer.

In late September, [Mr. Trump changed his primary residence from Manhattan to Palm Beach, Fla.,](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/nyregion/trump-florida-move-taxes.html) according to documents filed with the Palm Beach County Circuit Court. Melania Trump, the first lady, also changed her residence to Palm Beach in an identical document.

Each of the Trumps filed a “declaration of domicile” saying that the Mar-a-Lago Club, Mr. Trump’s resort in Palm Beach, will be their permanent residence.

The president [confirmed the decision on Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1190079191355670529) after The New York Times reported on the move, saying that he would “be making [Palm Beach, Florida](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/01/nyregion/trump-florida-move-taxes.html), our Permanent Residence.”

“I cherish New York, and the people of New York,” he added, “and always will.”

But he didn’t have much nice to say about the public officials of New York.
