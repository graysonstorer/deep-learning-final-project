# Trump's billion-dollar settlement spree

President [Trump](https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump) has extracted more than $1.2 billion in settlements from 13 of the most powerful players in academia, law, media and tech, according to an Axios analysis.

*   If finalized, a potential $500 million deal with Harvard would represent his largest trophy to date.

**Why it matters:**America's most elite institutions have largely succumbed to the Trump administration's [cultural crackdown](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/23/dei-trump-diversity-affirmative-action), opting to pay up — often to the tune of tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars — rather than fight back.

*   Trump officials frame the settlements as accountability for society's liberal power centers, which they say have been captured by leftist ideology, corrupted by DEI and complicit in antisemitism.
*   Critics say the deals — some of which include direct payments or pro bono legal work for Trump's pet causes — amount to legalized extortion by the federal government.

**Zoom in:**Harvard has expressed a willingness to spend up to $500 million to settle its dispute with the White House, which has accused the university of civil rights violations tied to antisemitism and DEI policies, the New York Times [reports](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/us/politics/trump-harvard-payment.html).

*   Harvard [sued in April](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/21/harvard-sues-trump) after the administration began freezing billions of dollars in federal research funding, insisting it would "not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights."
*   The potential settlement would be more than double the [$221 million fine agreed to by Columbia](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/24/columbia-trump-federal-funding-deal) last week, though Harvard is reportedly reluctant to pay the government directly or allow an outside monitor to oversee the deal.

**The big picture:**Trump's coercion of elite institutions — as both president and plaintiff — extends far beyond college campuses.

*   **Big Law:**At least nine major firms — targeted for their DEI programs or ties to Trump's political enemies — have [agreed to settlements](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/11/business/trump-law-firms-kirkland-ellis-latham-watkins.html), offering between $40 million and $125 million in free legal services to preserve their access to the federal government.
*   **Paramount:**The CBS parent company [paid $16 million](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/02/trump-paramount-cbs-harris-interview-lawsuit-settlement) this month to settle Trump's lawsuit over the editing of a "[60 Minutes](https://www.axios.com/2025/04/30/trump-cbs-news-lawsuit-new-york-times-threat)" interview with Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign. The deal cleared the way for the [FCC to approve Paramount's $8 billion merger](https://www.axios.com/2025/07/24/skydance-paramount-merger-trump-fcc-approved) with Skydance, triggering major backlash from Democrats and press freedom activists. Trump [said last week](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114898229237459086) that the settlement is worth more than $36 million, including $20 million in ads, PSAs or "similar" programming from the new owner. Skydance [hasn't confirmed](https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/trump-unconfirmed-claim-skydance-20-million-advertising-psas-paramount-deal-1236467234/) that total.
*   **Disney:**ABC's parent company [agreed in December to pay $16 million](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/14/abc-trump-settlement-lawsuit) — primarily directed to Trump's future presidential foundation and museum — to settle a defamation lawsuit the president filed against anchor George Stephanopoulos.

*   **Meta:**The tech giant [paid Trump $25 million](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/29/trump-meta-facebook-instagram-settlement) in January to settle a 2021 lawsuit that accused the company of violating his First Amendment rights by banning him from Facebook and Instagram after the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.

**Between the lines:**The few law firms that [chose to fight Trump's executive orders](https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/trump-law-firms-courts-ruling) have largely prevailed in court so far, suggesting capitulation is not the only viable path forward.

*   Just last week, a [federal judge cast serious doubt](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/us/trump-administration-harvard-hearing.html) on Trump's targeting of Harvard — questioning the constitutionality of cutting off research funding over alleged antisemitism and warning of "staggering" due process concerns.

**What they're saying:** "President Trump, the most consequential dealmaker behind the Resolute Desk, has, since day one, crafted tailor-made deals that prioritize America, its people, its enterprises, and common sense," White House spokesman Harrison Fields said in a statement.

*   "Considering the level of buy-in from our allies and industry, no one can dispute the success."

**What to watch:**Trump officials see Columbia's settlement as a playbook for negotiations with other universities, one that combines financial penalties with internal policy changes and external oversight.

*   Emboldened by its early success, the Trump administration this week launched new investigations and lawsuits targeting [UCLA](https://www.reuters.com/legal/government/us-government-alleges-ucla-violated-federal-civil-rights-law-2025-07-29/), [Duke](https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/28/politics/trump-duke-investigate-university-law-journal), and [George Mason University](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/28/us/justice-department-george-mason-faculty-senate-investigation.html).
