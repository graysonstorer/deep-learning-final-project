A judge in Georgia dismissed the last pending criminal prosecution against President Trump on Wednesday, effectively ending efforts to hold him criminally responsible for attempts to overturn the 2020 election.

The president has now seen three criminal cases against him dissolve since he was re-elected last year. Charges were also dropped against Mr. Trump’s remaining co-defendants in the Georgia racketeering case, including Rudolph W. Giuliani, his former personal lawyer, and Mark Meadows, the former White House chief of staff.

The Georgia case had been seen as one of the most serious legal threats to Mr. Trump, because state criminal convictions are not subject to presidential pardons.

A motion to end the prosecution was filed Wednesday morning by Pete Skandalakis, the executive director of the state’s nonpartisan prosecutor council. In his 22-page filing, Mr. Skandalakis, a career prosecutor who ran for office early in his career as a Democrat but later as a Republican, shredded the case originally brought by Fani T. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, taking it apart charge by charge. He asserted that “it is not illegal to question or challenge election results.”

Mr. Skandalakis concluded that the federal inquiry undertaken by Jack Smith, the special counsel appointed by the Justice Department under President Biden, was the more appropriate venue for an investigation of Mr. Trump’s attempts to stay in power after the 2020 election. He added that the idea of pursuing a case against a sitting president in Georgia was impractical.

He noted that the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling last year, which granted presidents “absolute immunity” from criminal prosecution for acts within their constitutional authority, meant that it would take “months, if not years” to litigate immunity issues in the Georgia courts — and that all of that would have to occur after Mr. Trump leaves office in 2029.

“Bringing this case before a jury in 2029, 2030 or even 2031 would be nothing short of a remarkable feat,” Mr. Skandalakis wrote, adding that “the citizens of Georgia are not served by pursuing this case in full for another five to ten years.”

In a Truth Social post on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump celebrated the end of the case and berated Ms. Willis, adding, “We have to hold responsible those who attempted to destroy our legal system and nation itself.”

Ms. Willis’s office had no immediate comment.

Mr. Trump’s indictment in August 2023 prompted a unique moment in the history of the American presidency, when he traveled to Atlanta to be booked at the county jail. Mr. Trump, who was out of office at the time, would soon embrace his scowling mug shot as a symbol of defiance; his campaign organization still markets the image on coffee mugs, posters and pins.

The circumstances leading to his prosecution began in January 2021, two months after Mr. Trump lost the 2020 election to Joseph R. Biden Jr. Mr. Trump called Georgia’s secretary of state and pressured him to help “find” enough votes to reverse his loss in Georgia. Fani T. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, began investigating shortly thereafter.

More than two and a half years later, she brought a sprawling racketeering case against Mr. Trump and 18 of his allies, including several fake electors who tried to help him remain in power despite his loss at the polls. But Ms. Willis was removed from the case last December, after defense lawyers revealed that she had been in a romantic relationship with a lawyer she had hired to lead the prosecution.

In September, her office [lost a final bid](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/16/us/fani-willis-georgia-trump.html) to keep the case, when the Supreme Court of Georgia declined to intervene. Soon afterward, Mr. Trump wrote in a social media post that Ms. Willis and others who had brought cases against him were “CRIMINALS who will hopefully pay serious consequences for their illegal actions.”

The Justice Department under Mr. Trump is now investigating Ms. Willis. The New York Times [reported last month](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/20/us/fani-willis-trump-justice-department-investigation.html) that federal investigators were scrutinizing a trip she took to the Bahamas, though the full scope of the investigation remained unclear. Mr. Trump has directed the Justice Department to pursue retribution against a number of his perceived personal enemies.

Mr. Skandalakis was given the job of seeking a replacement for Ms. Willis after her removal from the case. Earlier this month, he told the court that he could not find another prosecutor willing to take on such a complex and fraught prosecution.

Ms. Willis, an elected Democrat, has said she was the target of frequent threats from Trump supporters, and had to temporarily stay away from her home as a result.

After Mr. Trump was re-elected, Mr. Smith dropped his federal election interference case, as well as a separate case stemming from accusations that Mr. Trump mishandled classified documents after he left office. Mr. Trump was convicted last year of 34 felonies in a New York case in which he was accused of falsifying business records to cover up hush money payments to a porn star.

Norm Eisen, a liberal lawyer and Trump critic who followed the Georgia case closely, said Ms. Willis played a role in its demise, describing her relationship with the lawyer she hired, Nathan Wade, as a “serious lapse in judgment.”.

But in a text message on Wednesday, Mr. Eisen, the executive chairman of the Democracy Defenders Fund, also criticized Mr. Skandalakis’s reasoning that the case would have been better handled by Mr. Smith.

“That is perverse and even Kafkaesque,” Mr. Eisen said, “when those efforts were cut off in midstream and there’s no prospect of them being revived.”

Mr. Skandalakis sought to portray his decision to drop the Georgia case as one untainted by politics. “As a former elected official who ran as both a Democrat and a Republican and now is the executive director of a nonpartisan agency, this decision is not guided by a desire to advance an agenda but is based on my beliefs and understanding of the law,” he wrote in a statement.

He did appear to call for more legal scrutiny of one aspect of the case, involving the treatment of Ruby Freeman, an Atlanta election worker who was “falsely accused by Rudy Giuliani and others of voter fraud,” as Mr. Skandalakis put it, and who also “endured harassment and threats.”

But he wrote that “the alleged crimes against Ms. Freeman must be prosecuted in Cobb County,” outside Atlanta, where they occurred. A spokeswoman for the district attorney’s office there had no immediate comment.

In his filing, Mr. Skandalakis called into question almost every decision that Ms. Willis made in bringing her case against Mr. Trump. Notably, he argued that “reasonable minds could differ” about how to interpret the January 2021 telephone call between Mr. Trump and Brad Raffensperger, Georgia’s secretary of state.

“One interpretation is that President Donald J. Trump, without explicitly stating it, is instructing the Secretary of State to fictitiously or fraudulently produce enough votes to secure a victory in Georgia,” Mr. Skandalakis wrote. “An alternative interpretation is that President Donald J. Trump, genuinely believing fraud had occurred, is asking the Secretary of State to investigate and determine whether sufficient irregularities exist to change the election outcome.”

He added: “When multiple interpretations are equally plausible, the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt and should not be presumed to have acted criminally.”

Mr. Raffensperger, in his 2021 book, “Integrity Counts,” was unequivocal in interpreting the call. “The president was asking me to do something that I knew was wrong,” he wrote, “and I was not going to do that.”
