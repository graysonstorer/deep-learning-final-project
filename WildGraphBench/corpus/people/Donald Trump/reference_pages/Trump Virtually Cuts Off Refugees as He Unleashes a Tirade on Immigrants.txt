WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said it would cut its already rock-bottom refugee admissions still deeper into record territory for the upcoming year, as President Trump returned to his anti-immigrant themes in the closing month of his re-election campaign.

The change in the number of refugees that Mr. Trump plans to admit is not drastic: no more than 15,000 in the fiscal year that began Thursday, [down from 18,000 in the 2020 fiscal year](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/us/politics/trump-refugees.html), which was a record low. The number was set in a notice sent to Congress late Wednesday, shortly before the statutory deadline to set the new limit.

Both numbers are slivers of the 110,000 slots that President Barack Obama approved in 2016. The big cut in 2020 virtually sealed off a pathway for the persecuted into the country and obliterated the once-robust American reputation as a sanctuary for the oppressed.

But the cut signaled that Mr. Trump is willing to take his exclusionary immigration policies still further, and it was delivered to Congress as the president was [unleashing a xenophobic tirade](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/us/elections/trump-ilhan-omar.html) against one of the nation’s most prominent refugees, Representative Ilhan Omar, on Wednesday night at a rally in her home state, Minnesota.

In the notification sent to Congress on Wednesday, Mr. Trump also proposed not admitting refugees from Somalia, Syria and Yemen, the origins of many in recent years, with exceptions for “those who have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of religion.” The administration cited security concerns within the region, even though refugees are not approved to come to the United States until they clear extensive security screenings.

By law, the president must tell Congress at the end of September the maximum number of refugees that will be allowed entry into the United States for the following year. Mr. Trump and the architect of his immigration policies, Stephen Miller, have used that power as part of their overall assault on the nation’s [legal immigration system.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/us/politics/trump-border-legal-immigration.html)
