Donald Trump Ran For President in 2000 in Several Reform Party Presidential Primaries
=====================================================================================

Posted on [December 25, 2011](https://ballot-access.org/2011/12/25/donald-trump-ran-for-president-in-2000-in-several-reform-party-presidential-primaries/ "9:52 am") by [admin](https://ballot-access.org/author/admin/ "View all posts by admin")December 25, 2011

Recently, Donald Trump has been suggesting that he might run for president outside the two major parties in 2012. He has talked about running as an independent, and also said he might seek the Americans Elect nomination.

This is not the first time he has showed interest in running for President outside the two major parties. In 2000 he ran in a few Reform Party presidential primaries. He won the California Reform Party presidential primary, polling 15,311 votes; others who ran in that primary were George Weber with 9,390 votes; Robert Bowman, 4,879; John B. Anderson, 3,158; and Charles Collins, 1,837.

Trump ran in the 2000 Michigan Reform primary, polling 2,120 votes, defeating an uncommitted slate which got 630 votes. A slate of delegates pledged to him submitted a petition in the New York Independence Party presidential primary, but it was removed from the ballot on the technicality that he himself had not submitted the petition.

Trump could have run in the Missouri Reform primary in 2000, but he did not file there, and Pat Buchanan won that primary.

He wasn’t up for the challenges of a major-party primary run this last spring; how could he ever handle an independent bid?

However, if he does get the AE nomination or something, and does not drop out later on, polls shows him with quite significant support in the general election.

What stupid thing with the brackets and quotes makes no sense. Richard, figure out if this is all coming from some mentally disturbed person (based on my Reform Party activities I may have a clue as to who it is) and ban the person if at all possible

Most of the votes cast for Trump were by Democrats (38%) or Republicans (31%).

Among registered Reform voters, Trump finished 7th behind McCain, Gore, Bush, Bradley, Keyes, and Nader.
