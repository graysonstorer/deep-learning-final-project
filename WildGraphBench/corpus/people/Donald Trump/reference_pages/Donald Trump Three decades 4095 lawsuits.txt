### 85 Branding and Trademark cases

Trump’s business these days is dominated by selling rights to use his name on everything from consumer products to buildings. Trump sued for $4.5 million over unpaid royalties after a company that had been paying him to call its liquor Trump Vodka fell on hard times during the economic downturn, hurting sales of pricier spirits. The company stopped making its licensing payments, and Trump terminated the deal and sued to recoup what he was owed. He won a judgment for the amount, though it's unclear whether he ever collected from the troubled company.

### 17 Campaign cases

Just since his campaign launched last summer, Trump has faced at least six lawsuits directly aimed at his campaign. He settled a copyright claim over his use of a photographer’s image of a bald eagle in May. Trump faces a class action lawsuit in federal court in Chicago [over text messages his campaign sent out](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/04/26/trump-campaign-sued-over-text-messages/83555270/) to people who say they never signed up to receive them.

### 208 Contract Dispute cases

In addition to the prominent cases tied to Trump University, Trump faced several class action cases over contract disputes tied to his real estate developments. His team argues in court that he's not liable for the deals that fail because he's simply lent his name. [Trump himself walked lawyers through the difference](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/) between a brander and a developer in a 2013 deposition in one of the Fort Lauderdale condo cases. “Well, the word ‘developing,’ it doesn't mean that we're the developers,” Trump said, arguing he’s not accountable when a project he lends just his name to goes under.

### 130 Employment cases

An employer of thousands, the Trump Organization and companies under its umbrella have faced more than 100 disputes over employment. In May, Trump Miami Resort Management LLC [settled with 48 servers at his Miami golf resort](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/09/donald-trump-unpaid-bills-republican-president-laswuits/85297274/) over failing to pay overtime for a special event. The settlements averaged about $800 for each worker and as high as $3,000 for one, according to court records. Some workers put in 20-hour days over the 10-day Passover event at Trump National Doral Miami, the lawsuit contends.

### 63 Golf Club cases

Trump’s golf courses have been at the center of several dozen lawsuits ranging from labor and personal injury claims to disputes over membership and dues. Most recently, Trump has battled members at his course in Jupiter, Fla., who held memberships when the course was the Ritz Carlton Golf Course before Trump bought it 2012 and contend he failed to return their fees. A federal judge set a trial for August.

Trump’s businesses have been involved in [at least 100 lawsuits and other disputes](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/05/19/trumps-tax-troubles/84543538/) related to unpaid taxes or how much tax his businesses owe, in addition to dozens of other court fights with government agencies. Trump’s companies have been engaged in battles over taxes almost every year from the late 1980s and into this year. In addition, at least five Trump companies were issued warrants totaling more than $13,000 for late or unpaid taxes in New York state just since Trump declared his candidacy in June 2015, according to state records.

### 14 Media or Defamation cases

Trump has [threatened to sue several media outlets and individuals over the years for words](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/2016/07/11/trump-bill-maher-and-miss-pennsylvania-ll-sue-you-effect/85877342/) that slighted the businessman, plus several other cases involving the mass media or media issues. He’s followed through on lawsuits against a much smaller number of outlets and individuals including Miss Pennsylvania, Bill Maher and author Tim O’Brien. He has won only one case over defamation, and the ultimate disposition of that case is in dispute.

### 206 Other cases

As a public figure for decades, Trump has faced so many different kinds of lawsuits that not all can be easily categorized. These other suits involve everything from divorce-related cases with his ex-wives to dozens of lawsuits from prisoners and other private citizens hoping to cash in on his enormous wealth or drag Trump into litigation. Many of those cases were dismissed before they could reach a courtroom.

### 697 Personal Injury cases

Owning and operating golf courses, hotels, condos and casinos meant Trump and his businesses faced hundreds of personal injury claims. Many end in settlements or dismissals, where the final resolution, including whether Trump paid the plaintiff, is unclear. The cases cover dozens of slips, trips and falls and others where casino patrons were injured on the properties in Atlantic City. In a few cases, Trump and his companies were plaintiffs in such cases, most notably involving executives killed in a helicopter crash.

[Reporters continue to review state and federal court files](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/how-usa-today-network-gathered-trump-court-files/85043410/). Wonder how that stacks up against Hillary Clinton? We found the former first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of State [has been named in more than 900 lawsuits, mainly as a defendant](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2016/06/01/donald-trump-lawsuits-legal-battles/84995854/). More than a third of those lawsuits were filed by federal prisoners, political activists or other citizens seeking redress from the government by suing a list of high-ranking officials.
