The Trump administration has said that the U.S. passports of transgender people must now reflect the sex on their original birth certificate, reversing a decades-old policy.

The Trump administration has pushed for restrictions on transgender Americans in nearly every arena, including serving in the military and playing on sports teams, but perhaps no measure has struck as broad and direct a blow to their identity and participation in public life as a new policy on passports that the Supreme Court this month allowed to take effect.

Passports must now reflect the sex on a person’s original birth certificate, regardless of whether that matches the person’s gender identity. The policy reverses the State Department’s decades-old practice under both Democratic and Republican administrations of allowing transgender Americans to change the “F” and “M” markers on their passports. The department also removed a more recent option, “X,” for those who do not identify as either male or female.

Earlier this year, a federal judge blocked the policy from taking effect, siding with transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs who said it violated their constitutional right to equal protection. But the Supreme Court granted the Trump administration’s request to allow the policy while a legal challenge continues, saying that “the government is merely attesting to a historical fact” when it requires a passport to show a transgender person’s sex at birth.

To people on both sides of debates over transgender rights, the passport marker question is foundational. The marker gets at the nature of transgender identity itself, rather than addressing a specific activity, and confers a designation from which other rights and restrictions flow.

The passport is a singular document, “attesting to the identity and nationality of the bearer,” according to [State Department regulations](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-22/chapter-I/subchapter-F/part-51/section-51.1), so its approach to transgender people may define — more than access to bathrooms, athletic leagues or cross-sex hormone medication — what it will mean to be a gender-nonconforming citizen of the United States.

“This is one of the most tangible, material things that Trump has done to every transgender person who is living in a sex different than their birth sex,” said Paisley Currah, a political scientist at Brooklyn College who is transgender and wrote a book that traces the history of gender markers on government identification documents. “It makes the identity document not work for its intended purpose, which is to prove who you are.”
