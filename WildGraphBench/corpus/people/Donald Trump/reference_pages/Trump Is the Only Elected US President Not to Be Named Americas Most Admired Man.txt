Americans have named their most admired man and woman of the year—and neither currently lives at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

In a [Gallup](http://news.gallup.com/poll/224672/barack-obama-hillary-clinton-retain-admired-titles.aspx?g_source=Politics&g_medium=lead&g_campaign=tiles) poll released Wednesday, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton were named the Most Admired Man and Woman for 2017.

This is the tenth consecutive year Obama has taken the man’s title, winning for the first time in 2008 and then every year of his presidency. This is his first win as a former president. Clinton has taken the woman’s title for 16 consecutive years and held the title a total of 22 times—more than any other winner of the Gallup poll. Eleanor Roosevelt is the closest runner-up with 12 total wins.

While Obama and Clinton have continued to capture the hearts and admiration of Americans, the margin of their wins is smaller than in years past. Gallup notes that Clinton won with just 9% of the vote this year—the smallest percentage since 2002, when she took the title with 7%. Ironically, however, she managed to eke out a win in the same poll in which she [registered a personal low favorable rating](http://news.gallup.com/poll/224330/hillary-clinton-favorable-rating-new-low.aspx?g_source=Politics&g_medium=newsfeed&g_campaign=tiles). Clinton edged out Michelle Obama, who took second place with 7% of the vote.

Meanwhile, Obama won the Most Admired Man title with 17% of the vote, down from 22% last year. Nevertheless, he has won the title in years past with as low as 16%. Obama also managed to beat current president Donald Trump, who received 14% of the vote. Trump is one of few incumbent presidents not to take the title and the only elected president to lose in his first year. Ford also lost in his first year in office after taking over the presidency following Richard Nixon’s resignation. In the 71 times Gallup has run this poll since 1946, the incumbent has won 58 times. Trump joins Truman, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, and George W. Bush who didn’t finish first during at least one year of their term.

The poll was conducted via telephone Dec. 4-11 with a random sample of 1,049 adults aged 18 or over living across the U.S. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points at a 95% confidence level.
