WASHINGTON — Giants in telecommunications, like Verizon and AT&T, will not have to take “[reasonable measures](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3480299-10-Examples-Industries-Push-Followed-by-Trump.html#document/p9/a341253)” to ensure that their customers’ Social Security numbers, web browsing history and other personal information are not stolen or accidentally released.

Wall Street banks like Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase [will not be punished](http://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/pr7531-17), at least for now, for not collecting extra money from customers to cover potential losses from certain kinds of [high-risk trades](http://www.cftc.gov/lawregulation/doddfrankact/registerswapdealer) that helped unleash the 2008 financial crisis.

And Social Security Administration data will [no longer be used to try to block](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3480299-10-Examples-Industries-Push-Followed-by-Trump.html#document/p44/a341282) individuals with disabling mental health issues from buying handguns, [nor will hunters be banned](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3480299-10-Examples-Industries-Push-Followed-by-Trump.html#document/p1/a341221) from using [lead-based bullets](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3480299-10-Examples-Industries-Push-Followed-by-Trump.html), which can accidentally poison wildlife, on 150 million acres of federal lands.

These are just a few of the more than 90 regulations that federal agencies and the Republican-controlled Congress have delayed, suspended or reversed in the month and a half since President Trump took office, according to a tally by The New York Times.

The emerging effort — dozens more rules could be eliminated in the coming weeks — is one of the most significant shifts in regulatory policy in recent decades. It is the leading edge of what Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump’s chief strategist, [described late last month](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/us/politics/stephen-bannon-cpac-speech.html?_r=0) as “the deconstruction of the administrative state.”
