The Lie of Trump's 'Self-Funding' Campaign
==========================================

Pundits are calling foul on the presumptive Republican nominee for starting to court donors, but he’s depended on donations and loans to himself all along.

Throughout the fall and winter, a favorite media narrative was to link Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump together, two outsiders who were upending their respective parties’ races by blasting donor-driven big-money politics. Sanders has kept to that rhetoric into the spring, making the recitation of his famous $27 average donation a centerpiece of every stump speech. But for Trump, it has turned out to be just that: rhetoric.

With the Republican nomination all but secured, Trump has changed his tune for the general election. Trump is suddenly looking to build a major fundraising operation, complete with donors and super PACs, rather than self-funding, as he’s boasted time and again that he is doing.

“I will make a decision fairly soon as to that,” [he said last week](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/donald-trumps-two-big-problems-uniting-the-party-and-raising-cash), wiping away those months of promises. “I mean, do I want to sell a couple of buildings and self-fund? I don’t know that I want to do that necessarily, but I really won’t be asking for money for myself, I’ll be asking money for the party.”

My colleague Conor Friedersdorf this week [labeled that a betrayal](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/the-americans-trump-betrayed-by-courting-big-money-donors/482025/) of Trump’s supporters. That’s not wrong, but Trump’s claims of self-funding have always been dubious at best and actively misleading at worst.

It’s not just that Trump is now courting major donors. (Sheldon Adelson, perhaps the most famous conservative donor not named Koch, [has a column in today’s](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sheldon-adelson-i-endorse-donald-trump-for-president/2016/05/12/ea89d7f0-17a0-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html)_[Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/sheldon-adelson-i-endorse-donald-trump-for-president/2016/05/12/ea89d7f0-17a0-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0\_story.html)_ explaining why he backs Trump, even though Trump has (1) bashed major donors and (2) been extremely aloof to Israel, Adelson’s major cause.) It’s also that he’s opening up to super PACs. Formally, Trump can do little to stop super PACs—according to the federal rules, it’s illegal for campaigns to coordinate with them. But candidates, including Trump, have found ways to send messages. I n October, Trump [demanded](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/23/donald-trump-tells-super-pacs-supporting-his-candidacy-to-return-all-money-to-donors/) that super PACs backing him close up shop—though only after the _Post_[spotlighted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/new-ties-emerge-between-trump-operation-and-super-pac/2015/10/20/80e7450a-7753-11e5-bc80-9091021aeb69_story.html) the close ties between the Trump campaign and one of the super PACs. In April, Trump’s campaign [sent a cajoling letter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/04/22/trump-campaign-disavows-pro-trump-super-pac/) to Great America PAC, a new super PAC backing him, complaining that the group could confuse backers and muddy his message.

More recently, however, after Great America hired former Ronald Reagan operative Ed Rollins, Trump seemed to be more accepting, calling Rollins “tremendous.” Rollins—who to be fair has a reputation for being a loose cannon with little regard for bosses—seemed confident about the PAC’s role, [saying](http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-wont-self-fund-general-election-campaign-1462399502), “Usually a super PAC is frosting on a cake. We’re going to be part of the cake.”
