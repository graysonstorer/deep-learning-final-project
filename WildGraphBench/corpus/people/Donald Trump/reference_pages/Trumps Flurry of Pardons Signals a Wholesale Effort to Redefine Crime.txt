Critics say President Trump has used the vast pardon powers of the presidency not to settle accounts, as President Biden did, but to burn the ledger.

President Trump is employing the vast power of his office to redefine criminality to suit his needs — using pardons to inoculate criminals he happens to like, downplaying corruption and fraud as crimes, and seeking to stigmatize political opponents by labeling them criminals.

In the past few days, Mr. Trump has offered pardons or clemency to [more than two dozen people](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/28/us/politics/trump-pardons-hoover-grimm-chrisley.html) embraced by his obstreperous right-wing base, or favored by people in his orbit. Most are political allies, some are former officeholders accused of abusing power for personal gain, and almost all were convicted of white-collar crimes like fraud, tax evasion and campaign finance violations — not far removed from accusations Mr. Trump himself has faced.

“No MAGA left behind,” [crowed Ed Martin](https://x.com/EagleEdMartin/status/1927092000848855360), the pardon attorney at the Justice Department who suggested that the department should investigate Mr. Trump’s adversaries [to shame them](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/21/us/politics/trump-justice-department-ed-martin-weaponization.html) if there was insufficient evidence to charge them.

Mr. Trump has used his pardon power, like nearly every other executive tool in his kit, to assert personal dominance over processes generally, if not always, governed by established ethical and institutional guardrails. He professes to abide by the rule of law, but has often shown a willingness to do so only when he defines the rules and the laws.

Mr. Trump has said the current wave of pardons is justified by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s last-minute reprieves for inmates on federal death row, and pardons he issued to his family — which Mr. Trump called “disgraceful.”

Yet, critics say, Mr. Trump has used the pardon powers of the presidency not to settle accounts, as Mr. Biden did, but to burn the ledger.
