*   Nov. 9, 2016

Thousands of people across the country marched, shut down highways, burned effigies and shouted angry slogans on Wednesday night to protest the election of Donald J. Trump as president.

The demonstrations, fueled by social media, continued into the early hours of Thursday. The crowds swelled as the night went on but remained mostly peaceful.

Protests were reported in cities as diverse as Dallas and Oakland and included marches in Boston; Chicago; Portland, Ore.; Seattle and Washington and at college campuses in California, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania.

In Oakland alone, the[Police Department said](http://local.nixle.com/alert/5774587/), the crowd grew from about 3,000 people at 7 p.m. to 6,000 an hour later. The situation grew tense late Wednesday, [with SFGate.com reporting](http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Anti-Trump-protests-in-Oakland-turn-violent-10605621.php) that a group of protesters had started small fires in the street and broken windows. Police officers in riot gear were called in, and at least one officer was injured, [according to other local news reports](http://abc7news.com/news/fires-erupts-vandalism-reported-at-anti-trump-protest-in-oakland-/1599421/).
