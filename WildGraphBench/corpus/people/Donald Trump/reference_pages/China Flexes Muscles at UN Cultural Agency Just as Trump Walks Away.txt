China Flexes Muscles at U.N. Cultural Agency, Just as Trump Walks Away
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Washington had been a buffer against China’s efforts to use UNESCO to influence education, historical designations and even artificial intelligence.

Any traveler who has picked up an international guidebook knows the UNESCO World Heritage site designation as shorthand for a must-see cultural destination that’s worthy of a detour.

But the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has also become the target of an intense Chinese influence campaign in recent years as Beijing has sought to increase its reach over educational curriculums, historical designations and even artificial intelligence.

President Trump’s decision Tuesday to [withdraw the United States](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/22/world/europe/us-withdraw-unesco.html) from the group removes a powerful check on China’s effort, in the latest example of how the White House retreat from international institutions offers an opening for China to advance its soft power.

The United States was once the largest UNESCO backer, accounting for nearly 25 cents of every dollar. But Washington has had an [on-again-off-again relationship](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/us/politics/trump-unesco-withdrawal.html) with it for years, especially since Mr. Trump first took office in 2017, and China has stepped up to take its place. A Chinese official is now UNESCO’s deputy director general, a post that diplomats said is often awarded in exchange for political or monetary favors.

UNESCO has lent support to major priorities for China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, including the global infrastructure program known as the Belt and Road Initiative. Beijing has also lobbied heavily for World Heritage designations and is jockeying to surpass Italy as the country with the most culturally significant sites. Some of those sites are in oppressed regions like Tibet and Xinjiang, where many local residents view them as an attempt to appropriate and control their culture and history.

And while UNESCO wields tremendous clout over what counts as history, it is also the U.N. agency in charge of setting artificial intelligence guidelines. UNESCO has an agreement with [iFlytek](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/03/business/china-artificial-intelligence.html), a major Chinese A.I. company, to cooperate on higher education in Asia and Africa, according to Chinese state media. (UNESCO said it has partnerships with many artificial intelligence companies worldwide.)

An earlier version of this article mischaracterized the location of two pavilions erected by the Chinese government in Lhasa. They were outside a temple that is part of the palace complex, not outside the palace itself.
