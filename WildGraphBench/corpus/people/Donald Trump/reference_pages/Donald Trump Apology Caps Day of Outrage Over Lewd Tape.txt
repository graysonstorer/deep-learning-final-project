[Donald J. Trump](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/09/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign.html) issued an unusual [videotaped apology](http://www.nytimes.com/video/us/politics/100000004698416/trump-responds-to-outrage-over-lewd-remarks.html) early Saturday after a 2005 recording surfaced that showed him speaking in extraordinarily [vulgar terms](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/donald-trump-tape-transcript.html) about women, setting off an uproar in the Republican Party.

“Anyone who knows me knows these words don’t reflect who I am,” he said. “I said it, I was wrong, and I apologize.”

[The apology](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/politics/donald-trump-apology.html) came as the presidential nominee faced extraordinary censure from Republican leaders after the tape was made public. The recording captures Mr. Trump speaking about pushing himself on women and boasting that he could get away with “anything” because of his celebrity.

In the three-minute recording, which was [obtained by The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-recorded-having-extremely-lewd-conversation-about-women-in-2005/2016/10/07/3b9ce776-8cb4-11e6-bf8a-3d26847eeed4_story.html), Mr. Trump recounts to the television personality Billy Bush of “Access Hollywood” how he once pursued a married woman and “moved on her like a bitch, but I couldn’t get there,” expressing regret that they did not have sex. But he brags of a special status with women: Because he was “a star,” he says, he could “grab them by the pussy” whenever he wanted.

“You can do anything,” Mr. Trump says.

He also said he was compulsively drawn to kissing beautiful women “like a magnet” — “I don’t even wait” — and talked about plotting to seduce the married woman by taking her furniture shopping. Mr. Trump, who was 59 at the time he made the remarks, went on to disparage the woman, whom he did not name, saying, “I did try and fuck her. She was married,” and saying, “She’s now got the big phony tits and everything.”

On Friday night, Speaker Paul D. Ryan withdrew an invitation for Mr. Trump to appear alongside him in Wisconsin this weekend. [Mr. Ryan described himself in a statement as “sickened”](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/10/08/us/politics/how-paul-ryan-and-mitch-mcconnell-have-disavowed-trumps-words-but-not-their-support.html) by Mr. Trump’s remarks.
