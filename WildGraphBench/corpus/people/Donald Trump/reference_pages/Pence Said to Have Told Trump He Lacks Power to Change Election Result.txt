A day before he presides over a joint session of Congress to ratify Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory, the vice president tried to lower the president’s expectations while seeking ways to mollify him.

Vice President Mike Pence told [President Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/washington-dc-protests) on Tuesday that he did not believe he had the power to block congressional certification of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory in the presidential election despite Mr. Trump’s baseless insistence that he did, people briefed on the conversation said.

Mr. Pence’s message, delivered during his weekly lunch with the president, came hours after [Mr. Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/trump-congress.html) further turned up the public pressure on the vice president to do his bidding when [Congress convenes Wednesday in a joint session](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/us/politics/republicans-congress-election-certification.html) to ratify Mr. Biden’s Electoral College win.

“The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors,” [Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1346488314157797389?s=20) on Tuesday morning, an inaccurate assertion that mischaracterized Mr. Pence’s largely formal and constitutionally prescribed role of presiding over the House and Senate as they receive and certify the electoral votes conveyed by the states and announcing the outcome.

Mr. Pence [does not have the unilateral power to alter the results](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/05/us/politics/pence-trump-election.html) sent by the states to Congress.

More Republican senators came out on Tuesday against attempts to undermine the [results](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/14/us/elections/results-california-recall.html), including Tim Scott of South Carolina and James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, who said he viewed challenging any state’s certification as “a violation of my oath of office.”

In a process that is likely to go on for many hours, Mr. Pence will preside on Wednesday over a roll call of the states. If at least one senator and one House member object to the results from a state, they can force a debate of up to two hours about those results. Each chamber will then vote separately on whether to certify that state’s results.

For results to be overturned, both the House and the Senate would have to agree to do so. Because the House is controlled by the Democrats, there is no realistic possibility of any state’s outcome being rejected. In addition, many if not most Senate Republicans appear likely to join all Democrats in rejecting challenges to the results.
