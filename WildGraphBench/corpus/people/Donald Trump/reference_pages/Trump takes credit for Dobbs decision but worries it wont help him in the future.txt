 By [Grayson Quay](https://theweek.com/author/grayson-quay)

 published June 25, 2022

Former President [Donald Trump](https://theweek.com/tag/donald-trump) said Friday that the Supreme Court's decision in _[Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/19-1392)_ was "the biggest WIN for LIFE in a generation" and was "only made possible" by his three Supreme Court appointees.

During a 2016 presidential debate, Trump [predicted](https://twitter.com/michaeljknowles/status/1540490955220045824?s=20&t=Tl5iBrPNf3TWson4eVHhNQ) that _[Roe v. Wade (1973)](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-18)_, which established abortion as a constitutional right, would be overturned "automatically" if he were elected and given the chance to "put another two or perhaps three" pro-life justices on the Supreme Court. Trump's words proved prophetic. All three of his appointees — Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett — voted to overturn _Roe_.

[](https://theweek.com/donald-trump/1014657/trump-takes-credit-for-dobbs-decision-but-worries-it-wont-help-him-in-the)
Privately, however, Trump has expressed concerns about the political consequences of the _Dobbs_ decision.

Two of Trump's advisors told _[The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/06/24/trump-publicly-praises-roes-repeal-privately-frets-about-impact/?utm\_source=rss&utm\_medium=referral&utm\_campaign=wp\_politics)_ that the former president favors limiting abortion rather than banning it and has complained that a too-zealous crackdown on abortion rights could hurt [Republicans](https://theweek.com/tag/republicans) in the suburbs.

"He is convinced it won't help him in the future," one advisor said of Trump's response to the _Dobbs_ decision. Trump has [teased repeatedly](https://theweek.com/donald-trump/1010667/we-did-it-twice-and-well-do-it-again-trump-stops-just-short-of-announcing-2024) that he plans to run for president in 2024.
