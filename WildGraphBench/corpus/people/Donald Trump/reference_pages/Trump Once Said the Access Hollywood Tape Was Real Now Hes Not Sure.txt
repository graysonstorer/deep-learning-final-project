Trump Casts Doubt on ‘Access Hollywood’ Video

Although Donald Trump publicly apologized after the release of a video in which he admitted to groping women, people close to him say that privately he has expressed doubts that the voice in the recording is his.

Shortly after his victory last year, Donald J. Trump began revisiting one of his deepest public humiliations: the infamous [“Access Hollywood” tape](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/12/us/politics/donald-trump-access-hollywood.html) of him making vulgar comments about women.

Despite his [public acknowledgment of the recording’s authenticity](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/08/us/politics/donald-trump-women.html?_r=0) in the final days of the presidential campaign — and his hasty videotaped apology under pressure from his advisers — Mr. Trump as president-elect began raising the prospect with allies that it may not have been him on the tape after all.

Most of Mr. Trump’s aides ignored his changing story. But in January, shortly before his inauguration, Mr. Trump told a Republican senator that he wanted to investigate the recording that had him boasting about grabbing women’s genitals.

“We don’t think that was my voice,” Mr. Trump told the senator, according to a person familiar with the conversation. Since then, Mr. Trump has continued to suggest that the tape that nearly upended his campaign was not actually him, according to three people close to the president.

As the issue of sexual harassment has swept through the news media, politics and entertainment industries, Mr. Trump has persisted in denying allegations that he, too, made unwanted advances on multiple women in past years. In recent days, he has continued to seed doubt about his appearance on the “Access Hollywood” tape, stunning his advisers.

More generally, Mr. Trump’s views on the issue have changed depending upon the political party involved. He has [praised women for coming forward](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/16/us/politics/trump-franken-moore.html) after accusations were made against a Democrat, Senator Al Franken of Minnesota. But in the case of Roy S. Moore, a Republican candidate for Senate from Alabama, [Mr. Trump has said he believes Mr. Moore’s denials](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/21/us/politics/roy-moore-trump-alabama.html) that he behaved inappropriately with teenage girls, and he has effectively endorsed Mr. Moore’s candidacy.
