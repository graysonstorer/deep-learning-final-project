WASHINGTON — As a pro-Trump protest turned into a violent attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6 last year, four people in the crowd died.

*   [Ashli Babbitt](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/us/who-was-ashli-babbitt.html), an Air Force veteran, was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer as rioters tried to breach the House chamber.

*   [Rosanne Boyland](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/15/us/rosanne-boyland-capitol-riot-death.html) appeared to have been crushed in a stampede of fellow rioters as they surged against the police.

*   Benjamin Philips, the founder of a pro-Trump website called Trumparoo, died of a stroke.

Mr. Greeson and Mr. Philips died of natural causes, the Washington medical examiner said in April. He added that Ms. Boyland’s death was [caused by an accidental overdose](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/trump-riot-death-medical-exainer/2021/04/07/53806608-97cf-11eb-a6d0-13d207aadb78_story.html).

In the days and weeks after the riot, five police officers who had served at the Capitol on Jan. 6 died.

*   Officer [Brian D. Sicknick](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/us/brian-sicknick-police-capitol-dies.html) of the Capitol Police, who was [attacked by the mob](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/24/us/officer-sicknick-capitol-riot.html), died on Jan. 7.

*   Officer [Jeffrey Smith](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/us/police-suicides-capitol-riot.html) of the Metropolitan Police Department killed himself after the attack.

*   Officer [Howard S. Liebengood](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/10/us/politics/capitol-police-howard-liebengood-dies.html) of the Capitol Police also died by suicide four days afterward.

The Capitol Police had previously said that Officer Sicknick died from injuries sustained “while physically engaging with protesters.” The [Washington medical examiner later ruled](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/19/us/politics/brian-sicknick-death.html) that he had died of natural causes: multiple strokes that occurred hours after Officer Sicknick’s confrontation with the mob. The medical examiner added, however, that “all that transpired played a role in his condition.”

A [bipartisan Senate report](https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/HSGAC&RulesFullReport_ExaminingU.S.CapitolAttack.pdf), released in June, found that the seven deaths were connected to the Capitol attack. But the report was issued a month before two Metropolitan Police officers — Gunther Hashida and Kyle DeFreytag — [died by suicide](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/03/us/politics/capitol-riot-officers-honored.html) in July.

The police agencies have not classified the four total suicides as “line of duty” deaths that would [provide the victims’ families with enhanced benefits](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/us/police-suicides-capitol-riot.html). Washington law [excludes suicide deaths](https://code.dccouncil.us/us/dc/council/code/sections/5-716.html) from the line-of-duty designation.
