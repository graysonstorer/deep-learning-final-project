News Analysis

North Korea’s nuclear arsenal is far larger than it was when President Trump and Kim Jong-un of North Korea first met.

The timing was hardly coincidental when North Korea’s foreign minister [declared on Friday](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/11/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-trump.html) that hopes for finding peace with South Korea and its protector, the United States, “faded away into a dark nightmare,” and that talking with President Trump had given way to focusing on a more “reliable force to cope with the long-term military threats from the U.S.”

It was exactly two years ago that Mr. Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore, the first American president to meet face-to-face with a North Korean leader in nearly 70 years of war, uneasy armistice and nuclear standoff. At a news conference that day, Mr. Trump insisted he was the first president ever to negotiate true disarmament, which he predicted would begin imminently.

That bold initiative, once considered Mr. Trump’s signature foreign policy move, is barely mentioned in a White House overwhelmed with other crises. Two years after he enthusiastically [declared on Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1006837823469735936) that “there is no longer a Nuclear Threat from North Korea,” classified assessments and experts outside government conclude that the country’s arsenal is far larger than it was when the leaders held the historic meeting, the first of three. The estimates vary, but most conclude the North has amassed enough fuel for about 20 nuclear weapons in the time since the two men strolled through a garden in Singapore for the ultimate post-Cold War photo opportunity.

“I think he’s going to do these things,” the president told reporters that day. “I mean, I may stand before you in six months and say, ‘Hey, I was wrong.’ I don’t know that I’ll ever admit that, but I’ll find some kind of an excuse.”

How it went wrong is a case study in the risks of overrelying on leader-to-leader diplomacy, especially with a president who dove into one of the world’s knottiest problems with little preparation. For a while, Mr. Trump answered every question about the slowness of progress the same way: that he still enjoyed a “great relationship” with Mr. Kim, and that the United States would have been at war with the North by now had he not intervened.

Maybe so. But the two countries have dug in deeper than ever, with the United States episodically tightening sanctions as North Korea opened new channels with China and Russia to evade them. At the same time, the North never slowed enriching uranium or working on its fleet of intercontinental ballistic missiles.
