Of the nearly 240 pardons and commutations he granted during his term, only 25 came through the regular Justice Department process. The rest were a product of connections, influence and money.

WASHINGTON — Eliyahu Weinstein got word that two-thirds of his 24-year sentence for investment fraud was going to be commuted by President Donald J. Trump after the White House chief of staff called a well-connected Washington lobbyist who had been hired to lead his [clemency](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/us/politics/trump-pardons.html) push.

Lawrence McCarroll learned that the petition he had filed with the Justice Department and the [letter](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/lawrence-mc-carroll-s-letter-pleading-for-clemency-from-president-trump-2020/bdf22c87a5ab31aa/full.pdf) he had sent to the president had failed to win him a commutation of the remaining six years on his 33-year sentence for a nonviolent drug offense when his mother emailed from her home in Kenosha, Wis., to tell him his name had not appeared in news reports about Mr. [Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/21/us/politics/trump-pardons.html)’s final round of clemency.

“I cried and cried and cried myself to sleep,” said Mr. McCarroll’s mother, Judy McCarroll. She said she was left with the impression that the clemency process favored people who “paid thousands, maybe millions, or probably did favors for Trump,” adding: “You had to be connected. You had to be in that inside clique. And if you weren’t, you don’t have anything coming.”

The contrast between the treatment of Mr. Weinstein and Mr. McCarroll underscores the two very different systems for determining [who received clemency during Mr. Trump’s presidency](https://www.nytimes.com/article/who-did-trump-pardon.html).

In one system, people like the McCarrolls mostly hung their hopes on the regular process run by the Justice Department, which often took years to produce a response, if one came at all.

In the other system, people like Mr. Weinstein skipped the line and got their petitions directly on the president’s desk because they had money or connections, or allies who did. The team working for Mr. Weinstein’s release included Alan M. Dershowitz, one of Mr. Trump’s lawyers during his first impeachment.
