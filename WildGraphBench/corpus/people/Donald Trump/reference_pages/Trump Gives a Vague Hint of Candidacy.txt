Donald J. Trump, one of New York's biggest and certainly one of its most vocal developers, said yesterday that he was not interested in running for political office in New York, but indicated that the Presidency was another matter.

Mr. Trump, a Republican, bought full-page advertisments in three major newspapers around the country this morning to air his foreign-policy views. And an adviser disclosed that Mr, Trump is planning a trip in October to New Hampshire, site of the first Presidential primary.

While some campaign consultants scoffed at the notion of a landlord and casino owner as candidate, Mr. Trump, whose total holdings are estimated at $3 billion, stoked the speculation with a statement from a spokesman that said: ''There is absolutely no plan to run for mayor, governor or United States senator. He will not comment about the Presidency.''

Mr. Trump was not available to comment on whether he means to be taken seriously as someone pondering running for President, or was just stirring up a little smoke to draw attention to himself or his views. 'Capable of Being Elected'

His trip to New Hampshire is in response to an invitation from Mike Dunbar, a Republican who is running a ''draft Donald Trump'' movement.

Mr. Dunbar, who is well known in New Hampshire Republican circles as both conservative and off-beat, said he has arranged for Mr. Trump to speak at a Rotary Club luncheon on Oct. 22 in Portsmouth. ''There's not a Republican running who can win the general election,'' Mr. Dunbar said. ''I decided we better find someone who is capable of being elected.''
