Trump’s Interests vs. America’s, Dubai Edition
==============================================

Despite its pledge to avoid new foreign deals, the Trump Organization is moving forward with expansion plans in the United Arab Emirates.

On August 5, the Trump Organization [announced a new venture](https://twitter.com/trump/status/893841118328172544) via Twitter: the Trump Estates Park Residences, “a collection of luxury villas with exclusive access to” the Trump International Golf Course in Dubai. The Trump-branded (though not Trump-owned) development is part of the company’s [ongoing partnership](http://www.zawya.com/mena/en/story/Dubais_Damac_launches_new_Trumpbranded_villas-ZAWYA20170730135029/) with the Dubai-based real-estate firm Damac, which has previously made news due to its president Hussain Sajwani’s relationship to the Trump family. Individual units are [expected to sell for 2.6 million Emirati dirhams](http://www.zawya.com/mena/en/story/Dubais_Damac_launches_new_Trumpbranded_villas-ZAWYA20170730135029/), or roughly $800,000.

As with all of the properties with which the Trump Organization is involved, whether as owner or as licensor, the Trump Estates Park Residences creates a number of conflicts of interest. Whether the Trump Organization receives a portion of the property’s revenues or a flat annual fee in exchange for use of the Trump name (and in this case, that detail isn’t known), the company will be profiting from the villas—which means anyone looking to influence the president can try to do so by purchasing one of them.

The project also further entangles the Trump Organization, and by extension Trump himself, with a foreign government, creating the possibility that unscrupulous officials could attempt to gain some degree of leverage with the president by, say, issuing the property environmental violations or, alternately, turning a blind eye to irregularities in sales proceedings, in the hopes of receiving political favors. And the Trump Estates Park Residences certainly seem to go against the president’s [pledge](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/11/us/politics/trump-press-conference-transcript.html) that his company would pursue “no new foreign deals” while he is in office, though the Trump Organization has [justified](https://apnews.com/90c95dfef76244e49dcce682960bcd0b/Dominican-deal-tests-Trump%27s-pledge-of-no-new-foreign-deals) similar projects by arguing that they represented merely the fruition of existing deals.
