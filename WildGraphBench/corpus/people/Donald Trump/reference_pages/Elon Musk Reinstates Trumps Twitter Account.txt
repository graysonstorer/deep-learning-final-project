[Elon Musk](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/technology/elon-musk-twitter-takeover.html)[said on Twitter](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1594131768298315777) on Saturday that he would reinstate former President Donald J. Trump to the platform as part of a shake-up of the social media service, with Mr. Trump’s account quickly showing up again on the site.

Mr. Musk, who [bought Twitter for $44 billion](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html) last month, had asked users on the platform starting late Friday afternoon about whether to allow Mr. Trump back onto the service. Twitter had [barred Mr. Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/08/technology/twitter-trump-suspended.html)after the riot on Jan. 6, 2021, at the U.S. Capitol, saying his posts had run the risk of inciting violence.

More than 15 million votes were logged in answer to Mr. Musk’s question about whether to reinstate Mr. Trump, according to the results that Mr. Musk included in his tweet, with nearly 52 percent in favor of the former president returning to Twitter. Mr. Trump’s Twitter account went live shortly after, though the former president’s last tweet was from Jan. 8, 2021.

“The people have spoken,” Mr. Musk said on Twitter. “Trump will be reinstated.” He added the Latin phrase “Vox Populi, Vox Dei,” which roughly means that the voice of the people is the voice of God.

Mr. Musk and Twitter did not immediately return requests for comment.

Mr. Trump, who did not immediately return a request for comment, had announced on Tuesday that he [planned to seek the White House again](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/11/15/us/election-news-results/trump-presidential-run?smid=url-share) in 2024. Whether Mr. Trump will agree to return to Twitter is not clear. He has started his own social network, [Truth Social](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/01/technology/truth-social-conservative-social-app.html), in which he has a financial stake.
