The president’s stark departure from his message on Thursday night, when he announced guidelines for governors to reopen their states and said they would “call your own shots,” suggested he was ceding any semblance of national leadership on the pandemic.

WASHINGTON — [President Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/podcasts/the-daily/gretchen-whitmer-michigan-protests.html?action=click&module=Briefings&pgtype=Homepage) on Friday [openly encouraged right-wing protests of social distancing restrictions](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/us/politics/trump-coronavirus.html) in states with stay-at-home orders, a day after announcing guidelines for how the nation’s governors should carry out an orderly reopening of their communities on their own timetables.

In a series of all-caps tweets that started two minutes after a Fox News report on the protesters, the president declared, “[LIBERATE MICHIGAN](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169217531056130)!” and “[LIBERATE MINNESOTA](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251168994066944003)!” — two states whose Democratic governors have imposed strict social distancing restrictions. He also [lashed out at Virginia](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251169987110330372), where the state’s Democratic governor and legislature have pushed for strict gun control measures, saying: “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!”

His stark departure from the more bipartisan tone of his [announcement on Thursday night](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/us/politics/coronavirus-trump-guidelines.html) suggested Mr. Trump was ceding any semblance of national leadership on the pandemic, and choosing instead to divide the country by playing to his political base.

Echoed across the internet and on cable television by conservative pundits and ultraright conspiracy theorists, his tweets were a remarkable example of a president egging on demonstrators and helping to stoke an angry fervor that in its anti-government rhetoric was eerily reminiscent of the birth of the Tea Party movement a decade ago.

In another series of tweets on Friday, the president returned again to the kind of rank partisanship that has characterized much of his time in office, [rekindling a fight with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251181563506757632) of New York, only days after heaping praise on him. Mr. Cuomo, he said, should “spend more time ‘doing’ and less time ‘complaining.’”

The retort came after the governor said that New York could not fully reopen its economy without more widespread testing and help from the federal government. Even before Mr. Cuomo had finished speaking during his televised daily briefing, [Mr. Trump lashed out, tweeting](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1251181563506757632?s=20), “We built you thousands of hospital beds that you didn’t need or use, gave large numbers of Ventilators that you should have had, and helped you with testing that you should be doing.” He said Mr. Cuomo owed the federal government a thank-you.
