From 2005 until it closed in 2010, Trump University had about 10,000 people sign up for a program that promised success in real estate. [Three separate lawsuits](http://money.cnn.com/2016/03/08/news/trump-university-controversy-donald-trump/) — two class-action suits filed in California and one filed by New York's attorney general — argued that the program was mired in fraud and deception. In November 2016, just days after winning the presidential election, Trump agreed to settle the lawsuits. He repeatedly denied the fraud claims and said that he could have won at trial, but he said that as president he did not have time and wanted to focus on the country.
