Donald J. Trump is moving his three beauty pageants -- Miss Universe, Miss USA and Miss Teen USA -- from their decades-old home on CBS to NBC, he announced yesterday. But Mr. Trump and his former partner, CBS, could not agree on the reason for the switch.

Mr. Trump said that he had been unhappy with the way that CBS had scheduled the pageants in the past, and that when his option to buy CBS out of its 50 percent stake came up this spring he decided to exercise it. His move was hastened, he added, by NBC's agreement to also show the pageants on its newly acquired Spanish-language outlet, Telemundo, and sell pageant-related items on its cable shopping network, Shop NBC.

One executive close to Mr. Trump said CBS had shown interest in renewing its commitment to the program but walked away when it appeared that he was leaning toward making a deal with NBC.
