The electorate at a glance
--------------------------

The makeup of America's voting age population varies across the presidential battlegrounds. More details about who actually voted in this year's election (and in 2020) are available from [AP VoteCast](https://apnews.com/projects/election-results-2024/votecast), AP's survey of the American electorate.

The issues that decided the 2024 election
-----------------------------------------

The share of voters who said each issue was the most important facing the country in 2024, compared to 2020.

National Arizona Georgia Michigan North Carolina Nevada Pennsylvania Wisconsin
### National

In 2020, COVID-19 was the top issue facing the country for around 4 in 10 voters. This year, other issues are taking center stage.

AP VoteCast is a survey of the American electorate conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago. More details here: [https://apnews.com/ap-votecast-faq](https://apnews.com/ap-votecast-faq). Percentages may not add up to 100% due to rounding.Poll respondents were asked about the economy and jobs, health care, immigration, abortion, crime, climate change, foreign policy, gun policy and racism. Some of these labels have been shortened on the chart due to space constraints, including "the economy and jobs," which was shortened to "economy,” and “climate change,” which was shortened to “climate.”

A message from AP's Executive Editor on Giving Tuesday

Dear reader,

 As a truly independent global news organization, AP has been standing for press freedom and access since our founding nearly two centuries ago.

Today,we continue to protect this fundamental freedom.Journalists play a crucial role in holding elected officials to account and serving as the public's eyes and ears behind the closed doors of government.

**Today – on Giving Tuesday – will you support press freedom?**

Sincerely,

 Julie Pace

 Executive Editor
