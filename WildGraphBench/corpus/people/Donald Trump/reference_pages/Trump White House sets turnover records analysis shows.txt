By Associated Press

WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump has seen staff turnover in excess of 37 percent over the calendar year ending June 30, an AP analysis of White House filings shows.

According to the most recent filing, 141 staffers who worked for the president at that point last year are gone, with 138 new arrivals. The figures don't include those who arrived and departed during the year — like short-lived communications director Anthony Scaramucci — or those who departed before June 30, 2017.

Trump's White House is setting records for attrition, said the White House Transition Project's Martha Joynt Kumar. Some 61 percent of Trump's senior-most aides have left the White House. Only Bill Clinton's 42 percent comes close for the last five administrations.

The White House's annual salary disclosure to Congress shows that more than 170 staffers received raises over that period, largely reflecting promotions. Jordan Karem, the former deputy director of advance and now the director of Oval Office operations, received a $50,000 raise to $165,000. First lady Melania Trump's spokeswoman, Stephanie Grisham, received a $40,000 bump to $155,000. Research director Adam Kennedy, who was previously the deputy, received a $38,000 increase.

Sylvia Davis, a deputy policy coordinator, received the largest increase. She now makes 121 percent, or $85,000, more than the $70,000 she made as an assistant staff secretary.
