E. Jean Carroll, whose first defamation lawsuit faced challenges because Donald J. Trump was then the president, will sue him again over similar statements he made after leaving office.

When the writer E. Jean Carroll three years ago accused President Donald J. Trump of raping her in the mid-1990s in a department store dressing room, he denied having assaulted her and branded her a liar.

Ms. Carroll [sued Mr. Trump for defamation](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/nyregion/jean-carroll-sues-trump.html?searchResultPosition=1), claiming his statements had harmed her reputation. Mr. Trump and the [Justice Department pushed back](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/07/nyregion/trump-jean-carroll-lawsuit.html?searchResultPosition=5), arguing that he made his comments in his official capacity as president — which for legal reasons meant Ms. Carroll’s lawsuit would have to be dismissed.

But Mr. Trump is no longer president. And on Thursday, Ms. Carroll’s lawyer said in a court filing that her client would bring a new defamation lawsuit against Mr. Trump, this time based on statements he made last month in a social media post that accused Ms. Carroll of lying, and labeled her case “a complete con job.”

Ms. Carroll’s new lawsuit, according to the filing, will also include a claim of battery against Mr. Trump under a new state law, the [Adult Survivors Act](https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/bills/2021/S66), which [gives adult sexual assault victims a one-time window to file civil lawsuits](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/23/nyregion/adult-survivors-act.html), even if the statute of limitation expired years earlier.

Ms. Carroll’s lawyer, Roberta A. Kaplan, said in the court papers that the new lawsuit will be filed on Nov. 24, the start of the period in which the law allows suits under the Adult Survivors Act to be brought. The court papers included a copy of the lawsuit, which is to be filed in a week in Federal District Court in Manhattan.

Ms. Kaplan also asked the judge that the new suit be tried with Ms. Carroll’s original case, the one she filed in 2019. Ms. Kaplan proposed that the trial be held April 10.
