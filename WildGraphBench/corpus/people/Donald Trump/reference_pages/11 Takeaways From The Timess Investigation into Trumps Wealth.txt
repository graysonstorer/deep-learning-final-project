*   Oct. 2, 2018

[Donald J. Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/20/us/politics/trump-financial-disclosure.html) built a business empire and won the presidency proclaiming himself a self-made billionaire, and he has long insisted that his father, the legendary New York City builder [Fred C. Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/us/politics/donald-fred-trump.html), provided almost no financial help. “I built what I built myself,” the president has repeatedly said.

But [an investigation by The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html) has revealed that Donald [Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage) received the equivalent today of at least $413 million from his father’s real estate empire. What’s more, much of this money came to [Mr. Trump through dubious tax schemes](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/07/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html) he participated in during the 1990s, including instances of outright fraud, The Times found.

In all, the president’s parents transferred well over $1 billion in wealth to their children, which could have produced a [tax](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/us/politics/trump-taxes.html) bill of at least $550 million under the 55 percent tax rate on gifts and inheritances that was in place at the time. Helped by a variety of tax dodges, the Trumps paid $52.2 million, or about 5 percent, tax returns show.

The president declined requests over several weeks to comment for this article.

A lawyer for Mr. Trump, Charles J. Harder, provided a written statement. “There was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone. The facts upon which The Times bases its false allegations are extremely inaccurate,” he said. “President Trump had virtually no involvement whatsoever with these matters,” he continued, saying the president had delegated those tasks to relatives and tax professionals. “The affairs were handled by other Trump family members who were not experts themselves and therefore relied entirely upon the aforementioned licensed professionals to ensure full compliance with the law.”

In a statement on behalf of the [Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/05/07/us/politics/donald-trump-taxes.html) family, the president’s brother, Robert Trump, said, “All appropriate gift and estate tax returns were filed, and the required taxes were paid.”

Since [Donald Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html) first refused to release his [income tax returns](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/09/27/us/donald-trump-taxes.html), his campaign and then his presidency have been suffused with questions about the extent and sources of his wealth, questions that have only intensified with the Russia investigation. The Times’s new reporting reveals little about his recent business dealings. But the investigation — based on a vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records, and at more than 13,000 words one of the longest investigative articles ever published in The Times — offers the first comprehensive examination of the inherited fortune and tax dodges that guaranteed Mr. Trump a gilded life.
