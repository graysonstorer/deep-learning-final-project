The writer says the president hurt her career when he said she had lied about him attacking her in a dressing room in the 1990s.

[E. Jean Carroll](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/nyregion/jean-carroll-trump-rape-lawsuit.html) publicly shared a secret in June that she had kept largely to herself for more than two decades: Donald J. Trump, she said, had raped her in the dressing room of an upscale department store in New York City.

President Trump vehemently denied the allegations. He called Ms. Carroll a liar, intent on selling a new book. He said he had never met her, despite a photo of the two of them together in the 1980s. He told reporters that he would not have assaulted Ms. Carroll because “she’s not my type.”

Now Ms. Carroll, a journalist and columnist for Elle Magazine, has sued Mr. Trump for defamation, saying in a lawsuit filed in state court on Monday that Mr. Trump had damaged her reputation and her career when he denied her allegation in June.

His statements about Ms. Carroll, the lawsuit said, “are fully consistent with his tried-and-true playbook for responding to credible public reports that he sexually assaulted women.”

Another woman, [Summer Zervos](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/nyregion/summer-zervos-trump-defamation-lawsuit.html), a former contestant on Mr. Trump’s television show “The Apprentice,” has filed a similar lawsuit against the president, saying he defamed her when he called her a liar after she said he had sexually harassed her during a business meeting.

The lawsuits raise the possibility that the president will have to defend his statements in court, and evidence about the truth of the allegations will come out. The two women say they want to hold the president accountable for what they say were false statements, and to get him to retract what he has said.
