What are the best gifts for kids?

CYBER MONDAY

What are the best gifts for kids?

A full slate of big names [spoke Tuesday at the Republican National Convention](https://usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/07/19/republican-convention-tuesday-live-updates/87302556/), including Paul Ryan, Chris Christie and Mitch McConnell, but Google search results [testified](http://googletrends.github.io/iframe-scaffolder/#/view?urls=Tuesday%20speakers%7Chttp:%252F%252Fnewslab.pitchinteractive.com%252F5745060998021120-5671984008527872%252Fhorserace-4855751545716736-ww-US%252Findex.html,Tuesday:%20Ohio%7Chttp:%252F%252) that the most intriguing was Tiffany Trump.

“My father is good with advice, as you might guess," [she said](https://usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/07/19/republican-convention-tuesday-live-updates/87302556/) from the stage Tuesday night."But he keeps it short and the takeaway is usually the same: to help us find our own way and our own gifts.”

So who is Tiffany Trump?

![Image 2: Tiffany Trump walks the convention floor during the second day of the 2016 Republican National Convention.](https://usatoday.com/gcdn/media/2016/07/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636045573711316711-AFP-554140238.jpg?crop=4000,3031,x0,y0&width=660&height=501&format=pjpg&auto=webp)
She’s Donald Trump’s daughter, the younger and less visible one after her half-sister Ivanka Trump became a fixture behind their dad’s podiums.

But like her [steak-hawking](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trademark-trump-steaks-was-canceled-two-years-ago-records-show-n535876), [hotel-building](http://traveltips.usatoday.com/donald-trumps-hotels-42166.html), [reality star](https://usatoday.com/story/life/people/2016/07/19/spike-lee-omarosa-manigault-donald-trump-presidential-campaign/87286320/) dad, Tiffany Trump wears many hats: The 22-year-old is an Ivy League grad, a [minor Instagram celebrity](https://www.instagram.com/tiffanytrump/?hl=en)(163k followers!) and a one-time aspiring pop singer.

![Image 3](https://usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/07/19/who-is-tiffany-trump/87321708/)

She was raised in California by Trump’s second wife
---------------------------------------------------

Trump’s most visible children on the campaign trail — Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. — all come from his relationship with his first wife, Ivana Trump. Tiffany Trump comes from his relationship to his second wife, Marla Maples, a once-aspiring actress.

Maples has been seen more recently [on _Dancing with the Stars_](https://usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/03/08/trump-ex-wife-joins-dancing-stars/81465330/) as well as on the desk of ex-husband Donald Trump:

Tiffany was born two months before her parents’ wedding in 1993, as [NBC notes](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/tiffany-trump-5-things-know-ahead-rnc-speech-n612566). After the couple divorced in 1999, Maples raised Tiffany in California — the opposite side of the country from Trump’s New York empire.

"Since I have grown up on the West Coast, it definitely is different than all of them growing up on the East Coast," Tiffany said of her siblings in [a 2011 Oprah segment](http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/meet-tiffany-trump-video).

"It's a different lifestyle, obviously, California vs. New York. (In) New York, my dad is like the center of the city."

She dropped an electro-pop banger
---------------------------------

[![Image 4](https://usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/07/19/who-is-tiffany-trump/87321708/)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVpu6MnXBhQ)
Tiffany dipped her toes into the music industry with the release of “Like A Bird,” an auto-tuned electro-pop jam released in 2011. “It’s more of a hobby right now,” Tiffany said of her music in that Oprah segment.

Here are some of [the lyrics](https://www.reverbnation.com/SpriteSteban/song/16255051-like-bird-duet-tiffany-trump--sprite/lyrics):

> "Feel like I started falling, crawling through the liquid love. You’re cute and you tweeted me, baby you go 'Beep beep beep.' "

She’s a Penn grad, just like dad
--------------------------------

Like Donald Trump, who often mentions his time at the Wharton School of Business, Tiffany attended the University of Pennsylvania. She double majored in sociology and and urban studies with a concentration on law, according to _People_.

She’s a smart kid, apparently ("She's got all A's at Penn, so we're proud of her,” Donald Trump told [the magazine](http://www.people.com/article/tiffany-trump-donald-trump-daughter-bio)) and graduated in May.

Here is an Instagram photo of her with her older half-sister:
