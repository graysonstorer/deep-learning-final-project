The U.S. Entered a Recession in February
----------------------------------------

The pandemic forced the economy to contract sharply, ending a record expansion and prompting the group that dates U.S. business cycles to formally declare a recession.

WASHINGTON — The [United States economy](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/us/politics/mnuchin-powell-congress-economic-recovery.html) officially entered a recession in February 2020, the committee that calls downturns announced on Monday, bringing the longest expansion on record to an end as the coronavirus pandemic caused economic activity to slow sharply.

The economy hit its peak in February and has since fallen into a downturn, the National Bureau of Economic Research’s Business Cycle Dating Committee said. A recession begins when the economy reaches a peak of activity and ends when it reaches its trough.

This downturn is the first since 2009, when the last recession ended, and marks the end of the longest expansion — 128 months — in records dating back to 1854. Most economists expect this recession to be both particularly deep and exceptionally short, perhaps just a few months, as states reopen and economic activity resumes.

The National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonprofit group that tracks economic cycles in the United States, noted the unusual circumstances surrounding the slump in its announcement.

“The committee recognizes that the pandemic and the public health response have resulted in a downturn with different characteristics and dynamics than prior recessions,” the group said. “Nonetheless, it concluded that the unprecedented magnitude of the decline in employment and production, and its broad reach across the entire economy, warrants the designation of this episode as a recession, even if it turns out to be briefer than earlier contractions.”

Many economists believe the United States may already have exited the recession — or at least be on its way out.
