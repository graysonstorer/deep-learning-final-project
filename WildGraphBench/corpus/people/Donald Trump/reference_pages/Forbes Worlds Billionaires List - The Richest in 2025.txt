Another year, another set of records for the world's billionaire class.

Forbes has been scanning the globe for billionaires since 1987. We found 140 of them that first year. It took two decades for their numbers to swell beyond 1,000. Then there were 2,000 in 2017. Now, eight years later, another milestone: 3,028 entrepreneurs, investors and heirs make up this year’s ranking, 247 more than a year ago. Not only are there more of them, but they’re richer than ever, worth $16.1 trillion in total—up nearly $2 trillion over 2024. The U.S. has a record 902 billionaires, followed by China (516, including Hong Kong) and India (205). We used stock prices and exchange rates from March 7, 2025. For daily updated net worths of all 3,028 billionaires, check out our [real-time billionaires ranking](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/)[.](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/)

Methodology

The Forbes World’s Billionaires list is a snapshot of wealth using stock prices and exchange rates from March 7, 2025. Some people become richer or poorer within days of publication. We list individuals rather than multigenerational families who share fortunes, though we include wealth belonging to a billionaire’s spouse and children in certain cases, namely if that person is the founder of the fortune. For Russian billionaires, fortunes were calculated using ownership structures from February 2022, prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and before many made transfers of assets to managers, friends and others in an effort to protect their holdings from sanctions. We value a variety of assets, including private companies, real estate, art and more. We don’t pretend to know each billionaire’s private balance sheet (though some provide it). When documentation isn’t supplied or available, we discount fortunes. For daily updates of net worths, visit [Real-Time Billionaires](https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires./).
