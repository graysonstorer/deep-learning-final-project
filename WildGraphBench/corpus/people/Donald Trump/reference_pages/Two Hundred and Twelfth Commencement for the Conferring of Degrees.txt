STUDENT  CONCERN 

JoHN A. RussELL, JR. HAIL!  PENNSYLVANIA!   

> Doctor of Science

Hail! Pennsylvania! noble and strong; To thee with loyal hearts we raise our song. Swelling to Heaven, loud our praises ring; Hail! Pennsylvania! of thee we sing! Hail! Pennsylvania! guide of our youth; Lead thou thy children on to light and truth; Thee, when death summons us, others shall praise, Hail! Pennsylvania! through endless days. BENEDICTION The Chaplain ACADEMIC RECESSION 5Background of the Ceremonies 

The first Commencement in 1757 comprised a dual morning-afternoon session, at which were graduated distinguished men of the day like John Morgan, physician-in-chief to the American armies; Hugh Williamson and Francis Hopkinson, members of the Continental Congress ; and Jacob Duche, first chaplain to the Continental Congress. Honorary degrees were conferred by the institution for the first time. During the 1760's the practice was introduced of distributing large printed broadsides among the audience along with the regular programs. In Latin, they were dedicated in the names of the members of the graduating class to the civil authorities, the Trustees, Provost, Vice-Provost, and professors, all by name and with many expressions of respect. The main body of each paper was a series of propositions, statements, or theses, classified under various academic heads, which presumably the graduating students were willing to defend against any assertions to the contrary. The origin of these papers was obviously to be found in the practice of medieval universities, and they reflected the constant stress laid upon the practice of disputa-tion in the curriculum of that day. Provost Smith made an appeal to the audience for funds for the colonial College at the Commencement in 1764, and after the exercises two of the Trustees stood at the gate to receive  "the  free- will offerings of pious and well-disposed  persons."  The collection produced  40  pounds. The next year George Whitefield spoke in the build-ing originally erected for his use 25 years before. The Bachelor of Arts degree was conferred on William White, the future first bishop of the Episcopal Church in the 

United  States. Dr. John Morgan, who had just been appointed to the first professor-ship of the Theory and Practice of Medicine in America, read his medal-winning essay on  "The  Reciprocal Advantages Arising from a Perpetual  Union  between Great Britain and her American  Colonies." 

The July 4, 1781, ceremony was attended by the President and members of Congress, the family of the Minister of France, officers of the army, and other persons of distinction. The proceedings were suddenly halted while one of the students, Francis Murray, was in the midst of an address whose announced subject was Major Andre, the intermediary in the treason of Benedict Arnold during the previous year. Whether his remarks were unpatriotically favorable or unduly harsh is not known , but conferring of the student's degree was delayed until the following year. The guns of Gettysburg could almost be heard during the 1863 Commencement. The program explained the absence of one of the appointed speakers, George Straw-bridge, by the annotation,  " Excused-gone  for defense of the  State."  One  James W. Ashton, on leave from the army for the day, gave his oration in an old scholar's gown, borrowed from the Rev. Phillips Brooks, worn over the uniform of a lieutenant in the service of the  United  States. 6The order of the participants in the academic procession has varied during these two centuries. During one period the Provost, Trustees, and visiting dignitaries led the procession, whereas at another time members of the graduating class entered the hall first.  Of  unique interest is the fact that in the early  1800's  the janitor of the College led the procession carrying the diplomas for the graduates. For information of guests, the order for today's student and academic processions is as follows: the candidates for degrees by schools; the Macebearer; the Marshals; the Faculties and their Deans; the Officers, Associate Trustees, and Trustees; Candidates for Honorary Degrees; the Provost and the President. The University Mace is adorned with the arms and seal of the University, the 

Penn  and Franklin family coats of arms, the Rittenhouse Orrery, and a thistle symbolizing the University's early ties with Scotland. The Mace breaks from tradition in that in place of the usual eagle on the top there appears an acorn, representing strength and long life. The academic dress stems from the monastic robes of the Middle Ages, when the hood was worn raised for protection in drafty halls. According to the inter-collegiate system of academic costume established in 1894, Bachelors' and Masters' gowns are made of cotton poplin or similar material, while silk or rayon is used for the Doctors' gowns. The latter are trimmed with a velvet facing down the front with bars of the same across the sleeves. The mortarboard cap is standard in the United States; Doctors may wear a gold tassel, but all others wear black. Some institutions have in recent years authorized Doctoral gowns in colors other than the customary black; holders of the Pennsylvania  Ph.D.  degree may now wear red and blue gowns. The hood is lined with silk in the official colors of the institution which granted the highest degree held by the wearer, and the color of the bordering velvet indicates the field of study to which the degree pertains. Degrees will be conferred today in: Arts and Letters, white; Science, golden yellow; Business Administration, mustard; 

Education, light blue; Fine Arts, brown; Philosophy, dark blue; Medicine, green; 

Law, purple; Dental Medicine, lilac; Veterinary Medicine, gray; Social Work, citron. 

With the exception of two Bachelor of Arts degrees, the Master of Arts was the only honorary degree conferred in the early years. In 1782 the first Doctor of Laws 

degrees  were conferred on two distinguished visitors from France, the Chevalier de Chattelleux and Francois  Barbe  de-Marbois.  Upon  the same occasion, honorary Doctor of Medicine and Doctor of Divinity degrees were awarded. During the latter part of the last century institutions made a practice of conferring the Doctor of Philosophy, honoris causa. This ceased at Pennsylvania after the third such degree had been granted in 1891 , and since that time the  Ph.  D. has been granted only as an earned degree. Among the many prominent citizens in public life who have received honorary degrees from the University of Pennsylvania have been three signers of the Declaration of Independence and nine Presidents. The heads of foreign countries have been represented by Emperor Friedrich Wilhelm II , King Edward VII, King Vittorio Emanuele III, Crown  Prince  H . R . H. Gustaf Adolf, Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi, President  Felix  Houphouet-Boigny, and President Sarvepalli R adhakrishman . 7Note : As  final  action cannot  always  be taken by the time this program goes to press, these  lists  of degree and prize recipients are tentative  only.
