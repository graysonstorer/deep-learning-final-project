# Trump's bureaucracy goes to war

The federal government is going MAGA — fast.

**Why it matters:**President [Trump](https://www.axios.com/politics-policy/donald-trump) has only been in office a week, but the departments under his command are moving with blazing speed to transform the federal bureaucracy into an army of loyalists.

*   The new administration immediately moved to [freeze nearly all foreign aid](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/24/politics/us-freezes-foreign-aid/index.html), root out DEI programs, remove officials and whole offices deemed ideologically suspect, and muzzle public health agencies.
*   "We're getting rid of all of the cancer ... caused by the Biden administration," Trump told reporters while [signing a Day One executive order](https://www.axios.com/local/washington-dc/2025/01/21/trump-executive-order-schedule-f) that stripped employment protections from civil servants.

**Driving the news:**Late Friday night, the [White House fired 17 inspectors general](https://www.axios.com/2025/01/25/trump-fires-inspectors-general) — independent agency watchdogs responsible for identifying fraud, waste and corruption.

*   The mass firings, relayed via email, appear to violate a federal law that requires the administration to notify Congress 30 days before removing inspectors general.
*   Amid outrage from Democrats and ethics experts, Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) — a Trump ally and longtime advocate for whistleblowers — called on the president to [explain his decision](https://www.govexec.com/oversight/2025/01/trump-fires-multiple-agency-inspectors-general/402504/) to Congress.

**Zoom in:**DEI offices and programs have been shuttered across the government, including at the [CIA](https://x.com/MarkSZaidEsq/status/1882292888450814114), [Department of Veterans Affairs](https://www.militarytimes.com/veterans/2025/01/24/va-places-60-staff-on-leave-after-shutting-down-dei-offices/), [Army and Air Force](https://taskandpurpose.com/news/army-airforce-dei-policies/), and the [Federal Aviation Administration](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5099606-trump-orders-faa-to-terminate-dei-hiring-efforts/).

*   [Federal workers](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5102561-trump-dei-omb/) have been ordered to report colleagues who may seek to "disguise" DEI efforts by using "coded language."
*   And Trump [directed](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-illegal-discrimination-and-restoring-merit-based-opportunity/) federal agencies to each identify "up to nine" major companies, universities or non-profits to investigate over their DEI practices.

**There have been hundreds of staff removals** or reassignments, including [at the State Department](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/state-department-departures-trump.html), where far more career officers were asked to resign than in past administrations.

*   The Department of Justice reassigned [at least 15 senior career officials](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/21/justice-trump-removes-senior-staffers-national-security-criminal/), including a top counterintelligence attorney involved in the FBI's investigation of classified documents Trump stashed at Mar-a-Lago.

    *   The DOJ also [rescinded job offers](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/us/politics/justice-honors-program-trump.html) to recent law school graduates who were placed through the Attorney General's Honors program.

*   Trump's National Security Council sent home around [160 staffers](https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-security-council-staffers-d167985d61c96dd278b0e58a402ff865) while Trump officials conducted loyalty screenings to ensure they're aligned with his agenda.
*   One of the administration's highest-profile firings so far was [Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-fires-coast-guard-commandant-linda-fagan/),the first woman to lead a branch of the U.S. military. She was accused of leadership failures and an "excessive focus" on DEI at the Coast Guard Academy.

**Between the lines:**Trump loyalists have also moved to centralize control around public messaging, particularly when it comes to public health.

*   The Department of Health and Human Services ordered an unprecedented "immediate pause" on all [health reports and social media posts](https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/21/health/hhs-cdc-fda-trump-pause-communication/index.html) through at least the end of the month, leading scientists to cancel CDC meetings on the escalating bird flu outbreak.
*   The Pentagon also ordered a [global pause on all official social media posts](https://www.stripes.com/theaters/asia_pacific/2025-01-23/dod-military-social-media-pause-16584761.html) until the confirmation of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who has promised a radical culture shakeup across the U.S. military.

**The new administration is also moving quickly** on issues including LGBTQ and civil rights.

*   The State Department [froze all passport applications](https://abcnews.go.com/US/state-department-halts-passport-gender-marker-applications/story?id=118062178) with "X" designated as the gender.
*   DOJ ordered a [freeze on civil rights litigation](https://apnews.com/article/civil-rights-division-justice-department-trump-2dcb45cca7c9c9cdaea78282d4279c35) and is weighing a potential reversal of police reform agreements negotiated by the Biden administration. 
*   It also ordered federal prosecutors [to investigate](https://apnews.com/article/justice-department-immigration-enforcement-f0e3fc616da9746796378d1cd6385b1b) local and state officials in so-called "sanctuary cities."
*   Meanwhile, the Pentagon moved to [abolish an office](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/01/23/trump-pentagon-civilian-deaths/) set up during the Biden administration focused on curbing civilian deaths in combat operations.

**Zoom out:**Trump made no secret of his intentions to build a MAGA-aligned federal workforce during the campaign, and he quickly imposed a hiring freeze after taking office.

*   The vast majority of federal workers are career employees, not political appointments, but the president has made clear he wants them all to board the Trump train.
*   His administration is currently testing the ability to [email the entire federal government workforce](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/trump-administration-tests-power-email-every-federal-employee-rcna189126) from a single email address.

**What to watch:**Trump's nominee to lead the Office of Management and Budget, Russ Vought, will be a key architect of the White House's efforts to re-engineer the administrative state.

*   Vought has assailed "the woke and weaponized bureaucracy," and said in a 2023 speech to his conservative think tank that he wants to put federal bureaucrats "in trauma," [ProPublica reported](https://www.propublica.org/article/video-donald-trump-russ-vought-center-renewing-america-maga).
*   "When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains," Vought said — [comments he defended](https://www.eenews.net/articles/democrats-grill-omb-nominee-on-spending-federal-workers/) during his confirmation hearing.
