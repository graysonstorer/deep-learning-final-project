If successful, the move would permanently end the health insurance program popularly known as Obamacare and wipe out coverage for as many as 23 million Americans.

WASHINGTON — The [Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/upshot/pre-existing-conditions.html) administration asked the [Supreme Court](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/supreme-court-obamacare-aca.html) late Thursday to overturn the [Affordable Care Act](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/upshot/pre-existing-conditions.html) — a move that, if successful, would bring a permanent end to the health insurance program popularly known as [Obamacare](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/upshot/pre-existing-conditions.html) and wipe out coverage for as many as 23 million Americans.

In an 82-page brief submitted an hour before a midnight deadline, the administration joined Republican officials in Texas and 17 other states in arguing that in 2017, Congress, then controlled by Republicans, had rendered the law unconstitutional when it zeroed out the tax penalty for not buying insurance — the so-called individual mandate.

The administration’s argument, coming in the thick of an election season — as well as a pandemic that has devastated the economy and left millions of unemployed Americans without health coverage — is sure to reignite Washington’s bitter political debate over health care.

In his brief, Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco argued that the health law’s two remaining central provisions are now invalid because Congress intended that all three work together.

“Nothing the 2017 Congress did demonstrates it would have intended the rest of the A.C.A. to continue to operate in the absence of these three integral provisions,” the brief said, using the abbreviation for the name of the health care law. “The entire A.C.A. thus must fall with the individual mandate.”
