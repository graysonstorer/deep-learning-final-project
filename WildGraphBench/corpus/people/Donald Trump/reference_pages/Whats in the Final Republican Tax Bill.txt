What’s in the Final Republican Tax Bill
=======================================

By [WILSON ANDREWS](https://www.nytimes.com/by/wilson-andrews "More Articles by Wilson Andrews") and [ALICIA PARLAPIANO](https://www.nytimes.com/by/alicia-parlapiano "More Articles by Alicia Parlapiano")UPDATED DEC. 18, 2017

House and Senate Republicans have [released a final plan](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/15/us/politics/republican-tax-bill.html) to resolve the differences between their tax overhaul bills. The legislation would cut taxes for corporations. American taxpayers, in large part, would also get cuts, though most of the _changes affecting taxpayers would expire after 2025._

|  |
| --- |
| Income taxes | Current Law | G.O.P. Bill |
| The bill would lower individual tax rates over all. But to comply with Senate budget rules, the individual tax cuts would expire after 2025. |
| Tax brackets | Seven | Seven, lower over all |
| The bill would lower individual tax rates over all. But to comply with Senate budget rules, the individual tax cuts would expire after 2025. |
| Top rate | 39.6% | 37% |
| starts at: | $426,700 / $480,050 (singles/couples) | $500,000 / $600,000 (singles/couples) |
| Alternative Minimum Tax | Alternative income tax calculation for high-income taxpayers | Keeps, but increases exemption so fewer will pay it |
| Standard deduction and exemptions |
| The standard deduction would nearly double, so many more people would end up taking it. |
| Standard deduction | $6,500 / $13,000 (singles/couples) | $12,000 / $24,000 (singles/couples) |
| The standard deduction would nearly double, so many more people would end up taking it. |
| Personal exemptions | $4,150 per taxpayer and dependent | Eliminates |
| Family tax credits |
| The child tax credit would double, and it has a larger refundable portion that would allow more lower-income families to benefit. |
| Child tax credit | $1,000 | $2,000 |
| The child tax credit would double, and it has a larger refundable portion that would allow more lower-income families to benefit. |
| Refundable portion: | 15% of earnings over $3,000 | Up to $1,400 |
| Credit for other dependents | None | $500 |
| Family tax credits phase out starting at: | $75,000 / $110,000 (singles/couples) | $200,000 / $400,000 (singles/couples) |
| Inflation |
| The biggest long-term change for taxpayers in the bill, it would result in a tax increase over the long run, long after the tax cuts expire. |
| Inflation measure used for certain income thresholds | Consumer Price Index (CPI) | Chained CPI (C-CPI), a less generous measure |

| Individual mandate | Penalty for not having health insurance | Eliminates Starts in 2019 |

| New investment purchases | Complex rules for deducting over many years | Five years of full expensing, then phased out over five more years |
| Section 179 expensing | Small business expensing limited to $500,000 | Increases limit to $1 million |
| The bill raised money by speeding up the effective dates for these last two provisions, which were included in the Senate bill. |
