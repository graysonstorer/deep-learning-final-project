# Trump is turning the government into an investment firm

_Welcome back to Morning Money: Capital Risk. This reimagined Friday edition of Morning Money is diving deeper into how political and policy developments are moving markets, affecting risk and rippling through the economy._

The U.S. government is going into business whether businesses like it or not.

President **Donald Trump** wants to convert $11 billion in federal contracts and subsidies awarded to the struggling chipmaker Intel into an equity stake. The Pentagon is [now the largest shareholder](https://www.eenews.net/articles/trumps-mineral-megadeal-is-bypassing-us-laws/) in a rare earths mining business. Trump conditioned Nippon Steel’s acquisition of U.S. Steel on his receipt of a “[golden share](https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/2025/06/trump-golden-share-in-us-steel-deal-00403299)” that grants him significant control over its operations. He has announced plans to [slash prices on U.S. pharmaceuticals](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/prescription-pulse/2025/08/01/trumps-favored-drug-price-approach-is-back-00487703) and hatched deals that entitle [Treasury to a slice](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/11/trump-defends-deal-to-sell-nvidia-export-control-license-00503778) of the revenue that Nvidia and AMD generate from Chinese chip sales.

From [tariff carveouts](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/06/trump-says-he-will-put-100-percent-tariff-on-semiconductors-00496413) to [pro bono legal work from white-shoe law firms,](https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2025/03/23/trumps-legal-hit-list-grows-00244191) Trump is exerting power over U.S. businesses in ways that go beyond even Sen. **Bernie Sanders**’s (I-Vt.) aspirations. His ability to inject his agenda into private enterprises and dealmaking has shaken the guardrails that protect businesses from sudden political shifts and defied the free-market orthodoxy that was a hallmark of Republican economic policymaking.

But Trump’s approach has also created new risks that could divert capital from some of the domestic industries he has sought to promote, from semiconductors to pharmaceuticals. Investors hate uncertainty, and the president’s spur-of-the-moment demands for the government to exert control over private investment could suppress the very market forces that he needs to deliver economic growth.

“The more you politicize business decisions, the less efficient they’re going to be,” said **Gregory Mankiw**, an economics professor at Harvard University and a former top adviser to President George W. Bush and Mitt Romney. The president’s ad hoc forays into the private sector are “fundamentally inconsistent with free enterprise and the rule of law.”

“It’s really a big step toward crony capitalism,” Mankiw added.

Trump’s allies say U.S. economic policymaking was in desperate need of a jolt from the top down. Low unemployment, steady growth and surging corporate profits weren’t enough to generate much confidence in President Joe Biden’s leadership. Perceptions of Trump’s prowess as a dealmaker had burnished the public’s view of his economic stewardship during his first term, and the White House is now leaning into that _Art of the Deal,_ uber-capitalist image as Trump flexes his authority over the private sector.

“When you put this money in the hands of Donald Trump, you’re going to get a better deal for the American taxpayer,” Commerce Secretary**Howard Lutnick**[told CNBC earlier this week](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/08/19/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-u-s-commerce-secretary-howard-lutnick.html), describing how the government could flip the subsidies Intel received through Biden’s CHIPS Act into an ownership stake that would provide the government with a taste of the chipmaker’s future returns. “That’s what Donald Trump is.”

In Trump world, there’s a view that a potential Intel acquisition and other private dealmaking are one-off transactions aimed at shoring up industries deemed critical to national security. The administration has been exploring strategies to capture returns from the government’s largesse since shortly after the inauguration. That thinking informed Trump’s executive order to Lutnick and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in February [to form a sovereign wealth fund](https://www.google.com/search?q=trump+executive+order+politico+sovereign+wealth+fund&rlz=1C5GCEM_enUS1157US1157&oq=trump+executive+order+politico+sovereign+wealth+fund&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRiPAjIHCAIQIRiPAtIBCTE2NTU0ajBqN6gCALACAA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).

“Washington, D.C.’s blind commitment to consensus orthodoxy that ignored the realities of the world is exactly why Americans and America were left behind,” White House spokesperson Kush Desai said in a statement. “The Administration is simultaneously pushing the free market policies — such as rapid deregulation and The One Big Beautiful Bill’s tax cuts — that do work while rectifying the America Last policies that haven’t worked to safeguard our national and economic security.”

But where the administration sees upside, free market types see peril. Trump’s willingness to wield influence over the private sector has amplified the government’s role in picking winners and losers in regulated markets. That has further scrambled the ability of corporate decision-makers to strategize against an already unpredictable U.S. policy environment.

“If the government can come in and look to support companies, the government has a right to limit your returns,” hedge fund billionaire**Leon Cooperman** told POLITICO. **Jessica Riedl**, a conservative economist at the Manhattan Institute, compared the president’s efforts to cap prescription drug prices and buy private businesses to the actions of socialist governments with centrally planned economies.

On Intel, Cato Institute Vice President **Scott Lincicome** said that reverse engineering government subsidies into government-owned equity would chill the willingness of CEOs to partner with the federal government on future projects.

Lutnick ruled out taking governance rights in Intel, but if the government decides to use any stake it acquires in a private business to exert direct control over its operations — a la U.S. Steel — Lincicome warned that would dissuade outside investment in industries that the administration considers a national security priority. (For the Trump administration, that includes everything from copper and semiconductors to timber.)

Even some MAGA supporters are alarmed. One prominent Trump ally, granted anonymity to speak frankly about the president’s economic agenda, said the possible acquisition of Intel was “bad policy” that could trigger an enormous backlash. Another supporter said the government should stay out of the private sector and focus on deregulation.

It’s notable that Sanders — an avowed democratic socialist whose policies are largely viewed as toxic by the investment world — praised Trump’s designs for Intel. “If microchip companies make a profit from the generous grants they receive from the federal government, the taxpayers of America have a right to a reasonable return on that investment,” the Vermont senator said in a statement to POLITICO.

That may [bother the hell out of _The Wall Street Journal_’s](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/the-nationalization-of-intel-a59fb635?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAi44KDCj3bcwk6Kg5nSFNxXfB-PV5dqeaB8bMDfZT_5A8jcXdLWDmaxrFddTZ8%3D&gaa_ts=68a727f5&gaa_sig=tCryasdRgc3zSVL9HhHjLMWQPUlr6ip_Eo_T7ni-fK7xpv1leVQ6csMNyVgZ6RqXCqLJ-9rI9PrPfWUzhJs4KA%3D%3D) editorial page, or the traditional corporate conservatives who also held their nose at Trump’s protectionist trade and immigration policies. But the president’s hold over the GOP base — and [vigilant focus on hammering any outward criticism of his agenda](https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115016246479417087)— could limit the public uproar.

In the meantime, prominent business leaders and Republicans who derided previous government incursions on the private sector have already started to change their tune.

“Nothing’s for free in this world,” said **John Catsimatidis**, the billionaire New York radio station owner, real estate investor and longtime Trump booster. When it comes to Intel, “I agree on this one with Bernie Sanders.”

**Happy Friday —**Your hosts are firmly ensconced in their respective happy places. Victoria is surrounded by central bankers and economists in Jackson Hole.

**Powell’s balancing act —**Ahead of Powell’s speech at Jackson Hole, Victoria reports that [the Fed Chair is staring at the double-barreled threats of rising prices and slowing growth](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/21/powell-trump-fed-inflation-jackson-hole-00517488). And at some point — possibly as soon as this morning — he will have to decide which is the bigger danger.

**Fed mind meld**

It might not be the sexiest headline about the Fed these days, but Chair Jerome Powell in his speech at Jackson Hole on Friday is expected to announce changes to the framework that guides how it approaches its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment.

The framework document is designed to be a durable, high-level explanation of how the Fed intends to set policy over time. Its earliest iteration in 2012, adopted under then-Chair Ben Bernanke, was the first time the Fed had formally set out its 2 percent inflation target. The document did not change significantly in the intervening years until 2020, but Powell has now established the practice of reviewing it every five years.

To get a better sense of what to watch on this front and why it matters, Victoria caught up with **Ellen Meade**, an economics professor at Duke University who spent a decade on the Fed’s staff.

**Meade was a key internal adviser on monetary policy and communications** during the last framework review, and she said the thrust of this week’s announcement might be to abandon many of the [changes made in 2020](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/08/27/federal-reserve-boost-employment-403494).

At that time, the Fed made two particularly notable changes, Meade said. The first was to make its inflation target more “flexible,” with a view to allowing inflation to run above target after many years of below-2 percent increases in the cost of living. The Fed also backed off its prior approach of targeting a particular “natural” rate of unemployment and said it wouldn’t worry if joblessness fell below that estimated rate unless inflation was in the offing.

“To me, it was really an acknowledgement that they were wrong over a series of years in estimating [the natural rate of unemployment],” Meade said.

But that framework was designed for a pre-pandemic world in which central bankers feared stagnation rather than high inflation. Powell has since argued that the new framework “proved irrelevant” once prices began to rise rapidly.

“It was very specific, and very particular, and seemed very driven by an unusual situation in the economy that had been going on for a while,” Meade said. “It wasn’t a man for all seasons.”

**She acknowledged that rolling back parts of the framework now** might look like an admission of a mistake. But she said people shouldn’t be surprised to see a shift because, ultimately, the framework is the Fed’s explanation of how it believes it is already acting.

“They’ve been behaving since 2022 kind of like [Paul] Volcker or [Alan] Greenspan,” she said, where the argument is for “achieving price stability as the fundamental thing you need to do first to set the groundwork for getting to maximum employment.”

“Jay [at his Jackson Hole speech] in 2022 sounded a lot like that,” Meade said. “I think they’re headed back to something that looks a lot like 2012.”

**More from Fed land**

Federal Reserve Gov. **Lisa Cook**’s real estate purchases are the latest front in the Trump administration’s offensive against central bank leaders. No matter what comes of Cook — or who Trump ultimately chooses to replace Powell — consider it a preview of the future of the Fed.

“How can this woman be in charge of interest rates if she is allegedly lying to help her own interest rates?” Federal Housing Finance Agency Director **Bill Pulte**[posted on X](https://x.com/pulte/status/1958162017468154310), shortly after requesting the Justice Department investigate his allegations that the Fed governor had lied on mortgage applications.

The [investigation into Cook](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/21/doj-calls-for-powell-to-fire-cook-over-fraud-accusation-00519032) represents a clear signal that Trump has taken to heart what many advisers and allies have told him: The Fed chair alone does not determine the path of interest rates. Rather, there is an entire rate-setting committee that votes on borrowing costs, and a majority of them sit on the central bank’s Washington-based, presidentially-nominated board.

And the more seats up for grabs, the more MAGA the Fed can be.

The widening scope of Trump’s war on the Fed suggests he might use more extensive tactics than previously expected to reshape the central bank to his liking — a scenario that markets haven’t fully digested. Few could have anticipated that the Fed’s costly renovation would dominate headlines for a full media cycle years after it began. More attacks are likely, and the stakes for Fed policymakers — and for Fed independence — are enormous.

**First in MM: Concerns over DOGE AI tool at SBA** — Senate Small Business ranking member **Ed Markey** (D-Mass) released a letter Friday to SBA Administrator **Kelly Loeffler**detailing his “alarm” at [recent reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/07/26/doge-ai-tool-cut-regulations-trump/) that the Department of Government Efficiency had used a deregulation tool powered by artificial intelligence that “reportedly flagged 85% of SBA’s rules and regulations for change or removal.” He requested Loeffler respond to his questions by Sept. 5, Katherine Hapgood reports.

“It is unacceptable that an unvetted AI tool is operating at SBA, and potentially driving policy decisions, without anyone’s knowledge,” [Markey wrote](http://subscriber.politicopro.com/f/?id=00000198-ce36-dda8-a99b-fefe075b0000).
