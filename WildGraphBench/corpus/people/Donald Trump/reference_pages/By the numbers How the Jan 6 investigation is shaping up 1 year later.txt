# By the numbers: How the Jan. 6 investigation is shaping up 1 year later

Nearly one year ago, thousands of people from nearly every state in the country traveled to Washington, D.C., where many of them [stormed the nation's Capitol building](https://abcnews.go.com/alerts/us-capitol-breach) after a political rally in an effort to stop the certification of Joe Biden's election victory.

The riot -- which followed a months-long disinformation campaign by former President Donald Trump and his allies, who claimed without evidence that the election had been stolen through fraud -- lasted seven hours, during which approximately 10,000 people came onto Capitol grounds, with many engaging in violent clashes with officers trying to protect the building and lawmakers inside. At least 2,000 made it inside the Capitol building.

Five people died during or after the attack, including four protesters and one police officer, and approximately 140 officers suffered injuries, according to the Department of Justice.

In the year since the attack, the Justice Department launched what officials have described as one of the [largest investigations](https://abcnews.go.com/US/attempted-murderer-lawmaker-arrest-records-shed-light-arrested/story?id=75139313) in American history, with hundreds of arrests and dozens of charges filed so far. The U.S. House of Representatives also formed a bipartisan committee to [investigate the attack](https://abcnews.go.com/US/jan-committee-obligated-criminal-referrals-chairman/story?id=82032247), issuing dozens of subpoenas.
