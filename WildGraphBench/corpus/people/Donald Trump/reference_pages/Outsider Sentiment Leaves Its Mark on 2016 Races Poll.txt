Demand for an outsider vs. a candidate with political experience

Bernie Sanders' Campaign Under Fire Over DNC Data Breach The Democratic presidential candidate's campaign sued after party leaders said what his team did was no different than robbing a house.

&#151; -- Demand for an outsider versus a candidate with political experience is the driving feature of the 2016 presidential campaign to date, propelling [Donald Trump](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/donald-trump.htm) in [the GOP](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/republican-party.htm) primary contest as well as buoying his support in a potential general election match-up against [Hillary Clinton](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/whitehouse/hillary-clinton.htm).

In the Democratic contest, our [ABC News/Washington Post poll](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-hits-high-gop-race-clinton-outsider-experience/story?id=35764718) finds that outsider status helps [Bernie Sanders](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/bernie-sanders.htm), as well, but in a much more muted way: Fewer potential [Democratic primary](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/elections/democratic-primary-primary.htm) voters care about it, and those who do tilt much more modestly to Sanders.

**[Tune in Saturday at 8/7 PM CT to watch the ABC News Democratic Debate in New Hampshire](http://abcnews.go.com/live?stream=1)**

As we’ve reported, the strongest independent factor in Trump’s support in the primary is whether potential voters are looking for a candidate from outside the political establishment or one with political experience. It’s also a major influence in a hypothetical Trump-Clinton matchup, even when taking into account partisanship, ideology and a range of other variables.

![Image 5: GOP Primary Support and Outsider Sentiment among Registered Leaned Republicans, showing Trump had 21% Political Experience and 50% Outsider, Carson had 8% Political Experience and 14% Outsider, Cruz had 19% Political Experience and 13% Outsider, Rubio had 19% Political Experience and 8% Outsider, and Bush had 9% Political Experience and 2% Outsider](http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/ABCWashPostPoll_GOPOutsider_1219.png)

Trump’s 38 percent support for the nomination -– his highest in ABC/Post polls to date -– is built on the fact that 58 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents prefer an outsider candidate, versus just 37 percent who say they want a candidate with political experience. Trump gets 50 percent support from those looking for an outsider, beating his nearest competitors ([Ben Carson](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/ben-carson.htm) and Ted Cruz) by more than 3 to 1. Among the minority who want an experienced candidate, Trump’s support drops to 21 percent, essentially tied with Cruz and [Marco Rubio](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/news/us/marco-rubio.htm).

Significantly, this 29-point gap in support for Trump holds up in a statistical analysis that controls for other factors that are likely to be related to GOP primary preferences, including ideology, views about most important issues, attitudes toward [Muslims](http://abcnews.go.com/topics/lifestyle/islam-religion.htm), education and other demographic variables.

Outsider preferences do far less on the Democratic side, for two reasons. One is that three-quarters of registered Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents prefer experience over outsider status, including 72 percent of liberals and 60 percent of moderates. Another is that Clinton manages 32 percent support even among those who favor an outsider –- better outside her sandbox than Trump’s 21 percent score outside his.

Specifically, Clinton overwhelms Sanders by 69-21 percent among leaned Democrats who place a priority on political experience. Among the relatively few who prefer an outsider, Sanders leads, but by a fairly modest 49-32 percent. (This result combines the last two ABC/Post polls for an adequate sample size.)

**General election
----------------**

The insider/outsider divide spills over into a general election matchup between Clinton and Trump as well. Unsurprisingly, Trump dominates among the outsider crowd (73-18 percent) as does Clinton among those looking for political experience (72-23). (This works out to a slight 50-44 percent Clinton lead among registered voters overall in this poll, produced for ABC by [Langer Research Associates](http://www.langerresearch.com/).)

![Image 9: A bar chart depicting General Election Support and Outsider Sentiment among registered voters, sourced from an ABC News/Washington Post poll, showcases Clinton's advantage in 'Political experience' with 72% support and Trump leading in 'Outsider' sentiment at 73% among all voters](http://a.abcnews.com/images/Politics/ABCWashPostPoll_GeneralOutsider_1219.png)

This chasm is not just an artifact of partisan and ideological divisions on the experience/outsider question. Even in the center, among moderates and independents, general election support divides nearly as strongly based on preferences for an outsider or an experienced candidate.

**Methodology
-----------**

This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by landline and cellular telephone Dec. 10-13, 2015, in English and Spanish, among a random national sample of 1,002 adults. Results have a [margin of sampling error](http://abcnews.go.com/PollingUnit/sampling-error-means/story?id=5984818&nfo=/desktop_newsfeed_ab_refer_homepage) of 3.5 points, including the design effect, for the full sample; 4 points for all registered voters; and 6 points for registered leaned Republicans. Partisan divisions are 33-23-34 percent, Democrats-Republicans-independents.

The survey was produced for ABC News by [Langer Research Associates](http://abcnews.go.com/PollingUnit/sampling-error-means/story?id=5984818&nfo=/desktop_newsfeed_ab_refer_homepage) of New York, N.Y., with sampling, data collection and tabulation by Abt-SRBI of New York, N.Y. See details on the survey’s methodology [here](http://abcnews.go.com/US/PollVault/abc-news-polling-methodology-standards/story?id=145373&nfo=/desktop_newsfeed_ab_refer_homepage).
