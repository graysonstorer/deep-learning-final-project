NEW YORK — Donald Trump’s sentencing Friday in his hush money case brought some closure to one of the most closely watched criminal proceedings in American history.

Trump has vowed to appeal, meaning legal wrangling is likely to continue over his May conviction by a jury on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. The case involves$130,000 paid to an adult-film actress ahead of the 2016 election to keep her quiet about claims that the two of them had a sexual encounter years earlier. Trump denies the allegations.
