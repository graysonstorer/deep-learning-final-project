Measure will fund government for three weeks after US economy lost more than the $5.7bn funding president requested for wall

Donald Trump has signed legislation to end temporarily the longest-ever partial [shutdown](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-federal-government-shutdown-2019) of the US government, which has left hundreds of thousands of federal employees without pay for more than a month.

The US economy lost $6bn during the month-plus hiatus because of lost productivity and business, according to a finance industry estimate – more than the $5.7bn of taxpayer funding the president demanded for his long-promised wall along the [US-Mexico border](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-mexico-border) but failed to get Congress to agree to.

[Trump agrees to temporarily reopen government after America's longest shutdown – as it happened Read more](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/jan/25/roger-stone-trump-russia-mueller-investigation-latest-live)

Trump signed the legislation on Friday. The decision marked a significant climbdown by the president. Less than 24 hours before he spoke in the White House Rose Garden, Trump demanded that any solution from Congress should include a “large down payment” for his long-promised wall along the southern border.

On Friday, however, intensifying delays at airports across the north-east and fresh polling that revealed mounting public frustration provided new urgency for efforts to break the impasse.

“We have reached a deal to end the shutdown and reopen the federal government,” Trump said, despite there being no fresh offer from [Democrats](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats) that could be termed a “deal”.

But he reminded Americans he had a “powerful alternative”, threatening to declare a national emergency if a deal for wall funding is not reached before the next deadline to fund the government.

“Let me be very clear,” Trump said, “we really have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier. If we don’t get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on 15 February again, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the law and the constitution of the US to address this emergency.”

The Senate unanimously passed a funding bill on Friday afternoon. It then went to the House, where it was unanimously approved.

The measure will reopen federal agencies for three weeks without providing any funding for the wall, Trump’s signature campaign promise. It will enable nearly 800,000 employees who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay to return to their jobs and to receive delayed payment.

As part of the agreement, Congress will convene a bipartisan committee to debate funding for border security before 15 February.

The shutdown was not only the longest but by far the[most expensive](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/01/25/shutdown-carries-price/2678304002/) in US history. Analysis by credit rating company S&P Global Ratings showed that the lengthy pause in federal government function under Trump cost $6bn in decreased productivity because of layoffs and economic activity lost to outside business.

“Although this shutdown has ended, little agreement on Capitol Hill will likely weigh on business confidence and financial market sentiments,” S&P said in a statement.

The agreement to reopen the government is consistent with Democrats’ negotiating position: that Trump should reopen the government before any new border security measures are agreed.

“Hopefully it means a lesson learned for the White House,” the Senate minority leader, [Chuck Schumer](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/chuck-schumer), said at a joint press conference with the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi. “For many of our Republican colleagues, shutting down the government over a policy difference is self-defeating. It accomplishes nothing but pain and suffering for the country and incurs an enormous political cost to the party shutting it down.”

Schumer praised Pelosi’s [leadership](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/20/nancy-pelosi-donald-trump-shutdown) throughout the month-long saga that consumed the first several weeks of her speakership.

“No one should ever underestimate the speaker,” Schumer said, “as [Donald Trump](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/donaldtrump) has learned.”

As the shutdown went on, Pelosi [rescinded](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/jan/23/government-shutdown-trump-disapproval-ratings-record-high-us-politics-live-news) the annual invitation for the president to deliver the State of the Union address in the House of Representatives chamber, a move believed to be without precedent. The speech was scheduled for 29 January but Pelosi said the decades-old tradition would only take place after the government reopened. Trump toyed with the idea of delivering it in another location but then unexpectedly [consented](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/23/trump-pelosi-shutdown-news-latest-statue-of-the-union-address-blocked) to her request without further fight.

Pelosi told reporters there were no immediate plans to reschedule the speech.

She applauded Democrats in both chambers for remaining unified, even as many freshmen from moderate and conservative districts weathered accusations that they did not support border security.

“It is very clear that we all understand the importance of securing our borders,” Pelosi said. “We have some very good ideas on how to do that.”

Later on Friday, Trump argued that he had not backed down in the feud over wall funding, claiming the agreement “was in no way a concession”, despite criticism from the right that he had displayed weakness and certainty from elsewhere that he had caved in.

A bipartisan chorus of lawmakers has now called for banning shutdowns.

“The final package should also end government shutdowns once and for all,” said Senator Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican.

As the [impact](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/26/end-of-shutdown-federal-workers-debts-credit-shattered-trust) of the [shutdown](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/us-federal-government-shutdown-2019) rippled across the economy, union leaders warned that thousands of federal employees were taking on part-time jobs and turning to charity and food banks. On Friday, employees missed a second paycheck. The same morning, federal aviation officials temporarily restricted flights in and out of New York LaGuardia, causing significant delays at Newark and Philadelphia airports.

At this unsettling time
-----------------------

We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could spare 37 seconds to support our most important fundraising appeal of the year.

In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year on from his second victory, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one.

From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced.

While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts.

While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel.

**Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less.**

**But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, it means we’ll show you fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you.**
