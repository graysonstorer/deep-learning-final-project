Trump administration sues to end some federal workers’ union contracts
======================================================================

The lawsuit comes after Trump issued an executive order moving to strip most federal workers’ unionization rights.

The Trump administration is suing the country’s largest federal worker union, seeking to invalidate existing collective employment contracts between government employees and agencies because they interfere with White House goals.

The administration filed the [unprecedented lawsuit](https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.txwd.1172831290/gov.uscourts.txwd.1172831290.1.0.pdf) late Thursday**,**shortly after President Donald Trump issued an executive order moving to strip [unionization rights from most of the federal workforce](https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/28/union-rights-federal-workers-donald-trump-00257010).

The lawsuit asks U.S. District Judge Alan Albright, a Trump appointee based in Waco, Texas, to authorize the agencies to “rescind or repudiate” some collective bargaining agreements with the American Federation of Government Employees because they “significantly constrain the Executive Branch” in its push to purge the federal workforce and exert greater control over agency operations.

In the complaint, agencies including the departments of Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Veterans Affairs, and the Social Security Administration claim that the AFGE entered into “midnight” agreements with President Joe Biden’s administration that included restrictions on “return-to-work policies” and other terms that unfairly limit the executive branch.

The “President and his senior Executive Branch officials cannot afford to be obstructed by CBAs that micromanage oversight of the federal workforce and impede performance accountability,” the agencies said in the complaint.

Much of the federal workforce has been unionized for decades. Roughly 32 percent of public sector workers are members of unions, more than five times the rate of private sector employees, according to [2024 data](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/union2.pdf) from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Unlike private worker unions, government employees cannot bargain over salaries, benefits or hiring and firing decisions.

The lawsuit names dozens of small unions representing subgroups of federal workers who share classifications and other job characteristics, as well as a collective employment contract with the government. It includes unions representing some employees at HUD, workers who provide medical services to the military at the Defense Health Agency, and some employees at Lackland Air Force Base.

The Trump administration is asking Albright for a reinterpretation of federal law that would permit the agencies to rescind union contracts, rather than alleging any particular legal violations on the unions’ part. It filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, where Albright is assigned all civil cases.

The Trump appointee has previously drawn public criticism and controversy for enabling so-called “judge shopping.” Albright’s [caseload represented more than 19 percent](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/dlj/vol71/iss2/3/) of all patent cases nationwide in 2020 after he openly courted patent attorneys and encouraged them to file infringement claims in his courtroom. Chief Justice John Roberts addressed the issue in the Supreme Court’s 2022 [annual report](https://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/year-end/2021year-endreport.pdf).
