White House Memo

In his second term, President Trump is using his power to reshape American culture, not just American policy. He has threatened consequences for many who disagree.

Cracker Barrel didn’t ask for this.

Just a couple weeks ago, it was a restaurant where patrons could play checkers and eat Chicken n’ Dumplins. That changed when the chain removed an image of a man sitting next to a barrel from its logo. The restaurant endured cultural backlash from conservatives, including President Trump’s eldest son, who accused the company’s executives of supporting diversity efforts.

After a call with White House officials and a logo change earlier this week, the company unwoked itself to Mr. Trump’s liking.

“Congratulations Cracker Barrel!” read the statement from Mr. Trump, who celebrated the old barrel man’s return to the logo. “All of your fans very much appreciate it.”

It used to be that you could switch off the so-called culture wars, or at least find a place to mute them for a little while. [Cracker Barrel was actually one of those places](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/31/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-cracker-barrel.html). But now, not even something as low stakes as a company’s logo can escape the gaze of a president bent on changing — or forcing — American life to reflect his own views and tastes, which often mirror the far-right ideological movement that fueled his rise.

The White House declined to comment on why this matter was worthy of the president’s time, and why officials had held the call with Cracker Barrel. But an official passed on a statement from Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, who praised the president’s “unmatched business instincts.”

The logo debacle seems like a small thing, but really, it shows how Mr. Trump is now using his power to reshape all aspects of American culture, not just American policy. He has not hesitated to retaliate against those who disagree.
