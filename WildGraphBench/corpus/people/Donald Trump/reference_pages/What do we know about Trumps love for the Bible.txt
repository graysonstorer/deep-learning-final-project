What do we know about Trump's love for the Bible?

The president appeared in images holding the Bible backwards and seemingly upside down

O n Tuesday evening, Donald Trump ordered the area outside the White House cleared of protesters by law enforcement who used teargas and flash-bang grenades [to dispel the crowd](https://www.theguardian.com/global/video/2020/jun/02/protesters-brutally-dispersed-ahead-of-trumps-photo-opportunity-with-a-bible-video). The impetus was a staged photo opportunity in front of the historic St John’s Episcopal church, which has already [been condemned](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jun/02/outrageous-christian-leaders-reject-trump-use-of-church-as-prop-during-george-floyd-protests) by religious leaders.

“Let me be clear, the president just used a Bible, the most sacred text of the Judeo-Christian tradition, and one of the churches of my diocese, without permission, as a backdrop for a message antithetical to the teachings of Jesus,” The Right Rev Mariann Budde, the Episcopal bishop of Washington, told the Washington Post.

Asked by a reporter if the prop was his Bible, Trump responded: “It’s _a_ Bible.”

As many other critics of the stunt have pointed out, aside from the disgraceful use of force against citizens to ensure a photo could be taken, the president appeared in images holding the Bible backwards and seemingly upside down, as if he’d never held one before.

“I just wish he’d open it once in a while,” Joe Biden said in a speech this morning.

That wasn’t the first such indication that the president is unfamiliar with the contents of the holy book.

Back in 2015, in the lead-up to his election, Trump frequently named the Bible as his favorite book. At a rally in Michigan Trump asked a crowd how many had read his own book The Art of the Deal.

“It’s my second favorite book of all time,” [he said](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/08/11/in-michigan-trump-attacks-china-critiques-auto-bailout-and-judges-bernie-sanders-weak/). “Do you know what my first is? The Bible! Nothing beats the Bible!”

It became a recurring theme for him on the campaign trail.

“As much as I love The Art of the Deal, it’s not even close,” [he said](http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/21/politics/donald-trump-rally-mobile-alabama/index.html?eref=rss_politics). “We take the Bible all the way.”

Not long after, the then candidate was asked during an interview with Bloomberg to expound on one of his favorite chapters from his favorite book and he demurred.

“I wouldn’t want to get into it. Because to me, that’s very personal,” he said. “The Bible means a lot to me, but I don’t want to get into specifics.”

Asked if he could at least choose between the New and Old Testaments, he again passed.

“Probably equal. I think it’s just incredible.”

A few months earlier he managed to remember at least one favorite line from the Bible that did stick out to him in a radio interview.

“Well, I think many. I mean, when we get into the Bible, I think many, so many. And some people, look, an eye for an eye, you can almost say that. That’s not a particularly nice thing. But you know, if you look at what’s happening to our country, I mean, when you see what’s going on with our country, how people are taking advantage of us, and how they scoff at us and laugh at us.””

The next year, at a service in Iowa, Trump [attempted to put money in the communion plate](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2016/02/01/donald-trump-accidentally-put-money-in-the-communion-plate-at-a-church-in-iowa/). Previously he had said it was a process he was familiar with, saying he would often “drink his little wine and “take his little cracker”.

In March, a pastor who leads a Bible study group for members of the Trump cabinet, and is reported to be a loose adviser to the president, [wrote a piece](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/trump-s-bible-teacher-says-gays-among-those-blame-covid-n1168981) that blamed the Covid-19 pandemic on gay people and environmentalists.

Last year, Trump shared a quote from a non-Jewish radio host who likened him to the “King of Israel” and said Israelis “love him like he is the second coming of God”.

“Thank you,” the president responded.

The president, who has said he does not frequently ask for forgiveness, is not a regular churchgoer. During the impeachment vote he said of Mitt Romney, “I don’t like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong.”

In 2016, he won 81% of the white evangelical vote.

At this unsettling time
-----------------------

We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could spare 37 seconds to support our most important fundraising appeal of the year.

In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year on from his second victory, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one.

From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced.

While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts.

While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel.

**Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less.**

**But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, it means we’ll show you fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you.**
