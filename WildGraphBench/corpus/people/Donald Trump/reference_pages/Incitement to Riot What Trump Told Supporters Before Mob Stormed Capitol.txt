Incitement to Riot? What Trump Told Supporters Before Mob Stormed Capitol
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a closer look at what the president said at a rally of his supporters, which is a central focus of the impeachment case being prepared against him.

WASHINGTON — The speech that President Trump delivered to his supporters just before they attacked the Capitol last week is a central focus as House Democrats prepare an article of impeachment against him for inciting the deadly [riot](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/science/crowds-mob-psychology.html).

Mr. Trump had urged supporters to come to Washington for a “Save America March” on Wednesday, when Congress would ceremonially count President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s win, telling them to “[be there, will be wild!](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/06/us/politics/capitol-mob-trump-supporters.html)” At a rally just before the violence, he repeated many of his falsehoods about how the election was stolen, then dispatched the marchers to the Capitol as those proceedings were about to start.

Here are some notable excerpts from Mr. Trump’s remarks, with analysis.

Trump urged his supporters to ‘fight much harder’ against ‘bad people’ and ‘show strength’ at the Capitol.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> “Republicans are constantly **fighting like a boxer with his hands tied behind his back**. It’s like a boxer. And we want to be so nice. We want to be so respectful of everybody, including **bad peopl**e. And we’re going to have to **fight much harde**r. …
> 
> 
> “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them, because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. **You have to show strength**, and you have to be strong.”

The president’s speech was riddled with violent imagery and calls to fight harder than before. By contrast, he made only a passing suggestion that the protest should be nonviolent, saying, “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.”

During Mr. Trump’s impeachment last year, one of his defenses was that the primary accusation against him — that he abused his power by withholding aid to Ukraine in an attempt to get its president to announce a corruption investigation into Mr. Biden — was not an ordinary crime, so it did not matter even if it were true. Most [legal specialists said that made no difference](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/us/politics/trump-impeachment-legal-defense.html) for impeachment purposes, but in any case that argument would not be a defense here. Several laws clearly make it a crime to [incite a riot](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2101) or otherwise [try to get another person to engage in a violent crime](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/373) against property or people.

Trump told the crowd that ‘very different rules’ applied.
---------------------------------------------------------

> “When you catch somebody in a fraud, **you are allowed to go by very different rules**. So I hope Mike has the courage to do what he has to do, and I hope he doesn’t listen to the RINOs and the stupid people that he’s listening to.”

Whipping up anger against Republicans who were not going along with his plan for subverting the election, like Vice President Mike Pence, Mr. Trump told the crowd that “different rules” now applied. At the most obvious level, the president was arguing that what he wanted Mr. Pence to do — reject the state-certified Electoral College results — would be legitimate, but the notion of “very different rules” applying carried broader overtones of extraordinary permission as well. (“RINO” is a term of abuse used by highly partisan Republicans against more moderate colleagues they deem to be “Republicans in Name Only.”)
