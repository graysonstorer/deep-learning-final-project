As [the midterm primary season comes to an end](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/us/elections/midterm-elections-calendar.html), candidates endorsed by former President Donald J. Trump have continued to rack up wins, but with a handful of prominent losses.

Of the more than 200 Republicans Mr. Trump has backed this year, many ran unopposed or faced little-known opponents. He has also waited to make some endorsements until a front-runner emerged, as with his [last-minute endorsement](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/29/us/politics/trump-endorses-tudor-dixon-michigan.html) of [Tudor Dixon](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/us/politics/tudor-dixon-michigan.html) for governor of Michigan.

Several of his candidates were defeated in early primaries, including in [Georgia](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/05/24/us/election-georgia-primary-texas) and [North Carolina](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/us/politics/madison-cawthorn-concedes-nc-primary-gop.html); more recently, he had a startling loss in a special election in [Alaska](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/31/us/politics/mary-peltola-alaska-special-election.html). But for candidates like J.D. Vance in [Ohio](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/03/us/politics/vance-wins-trump-senate-primary-ohio.html) and Mehmet Oz in [Pennsylvania](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/03/us/elections/pennsylvania-senate-oz-mccormick.html), Mr. Trump’s support was crucial to securing victory. His choices also won in large numbers in two swing states, [Arizona](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/04/us/politics/kari-lake-arizona-governor.html) and [Michigan](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/02/us/politics/tudor-dixon-michigan.html).

Here is a look at Mr. Trump’s endorsement record.

### Big losses for pro-impeachment Republicans

In Wyoming, Representative Liz Cheney, the most prominent of the [10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Mr. Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/16/us/politics/liz-cheney-impeachment-10.html) after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, fell to her Trump-endorsed challenger, **Harriet Hageman**, in [a landslide](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/16/us/elections/results-wyoming.html).

Another of the 10, Representative Peter Meijer of Michigan, [lost his primary](https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/08/02/us/elections-arizona-primary-michigan/peter-meijer-concedes-michigan?) to Mr. Trump’s preferred candidate, **John Gibbs**. And in Washington State, **Joe Kent**[defeated a third pro-impeachment Republican](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/09/us/politics/jaime-herrera-beutler-concedes-washington.html), Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler.

In one exception to the trend, [Representative Dan Newhouse](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/05/us/politics/dan-newhouse-washington-trump.html), who also supported Mr. Trump’s impeachment, advanced over his Trump-endorsed opponent, **Loren Culp**, largely because of Washington State’s open primary system.
