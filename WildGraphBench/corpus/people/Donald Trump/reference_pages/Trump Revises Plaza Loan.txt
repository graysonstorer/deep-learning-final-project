Ending lengthy negotiations with his creditors, Donald J. Trump said yesterday that he had restructured debt agreements on $425 million he borrowed to buy the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan in 1988.

Mr. Trump's creditors, led by Citibank, agreed to restructure the $300 million first mortgage on the hotel that was originally scheduled to mature June 30, 1993.

Under the renegotiated terms, the interest rate on the mortgage was set at a minimum of 4 percent, where it will remain until the end of March 1994. The bank group agreed that the mortgage could be extended twice past that date, to Dec. 31, 1995. Rates after March 31, 1993, will be reset at the prevailing London interbank offered rate plus one percentage point.
