Trump's views on exercise were mentioned in a New Yorker article this month and in ["Trump Revealed,"](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1501156527?ie=UTF8&tag=thewaspos09-20&camp=1789&linkCode=xm2&creativeASIN=1501156527) The Washington Post's 2016 biography of the president, which noted that Trump mostly gave up athletics after college because he "believed the human body was like a battery, with a finite amount of energy, which exercise only depleted."
