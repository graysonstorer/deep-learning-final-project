President Trump called for one federal judge seeking basic information about his deportation efforts [to be impeached](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/trump-venezuela-deportations-doj-court-order.html) amid mounting concern about a constitutional showdown.

Another judge found that Mr. Trump’s efforts to [shut down a federal agency](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/us/politics/elon-musk-usaid-doge-unconstitutional.html) probably violated the Constitution and stripped Congress of its authority.

The president was accused of overstepping his executive authority yet again in [firing two Democratic commissioners](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/18/technology/trump-ftc-fires-democrats.html) from an independent trade commission.

And that was just Tuesday.

Nearly two months into his second term, Mr. Trump is trying to consolidate control over the courts, Congress and even, in some ways, American society and culture.

His expansive interpretation of presidential power has become the defining characteristic of his second term, an aggressive effort across multiple fronts to [assert executive authority](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/05/us/trump-federal-law-power.html) to reshape the government, drive policy in new directions and root out what he and his supporters see as a deeply embedded liberal bias.

“We’ve never seen a president so comprehensively attempt to arrogate and consolidate so much of the other branches’ power, let alone to do so in the first two months of his presidency,” said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at Georgetown University Law Center.
