# All of Trump's executive actions so far

President Donald Trump has spent his first days using his executive authority to rewrite American policy and undo a string of decisions made by former president Barack Obama. Here’s a running list of the new president’s executive actions:

**1. [Providing “relief” from the Affordable Care Act](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/2/executive-order-minimizing-economic-burden-patient-protection-and)(January 20)**

Trump’s [first executive order](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-eo-233950) on Inauguration Day involved “minimizing the economic burden” of the [Affordable Care Act](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/donald-trump-obamacare-order-234090). This order allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the heads of other departments and agencies to waive or delay the implementation of any ACA provisions that would impose a financial burden or any state or a regulatory burden on any individuals.

**2. [Freezing all regulations](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/20/memorandum-heads-executive-departments-and-agencies)****(January 20)**

Trump [froze all pending regulations](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/trump-executive-orders-agenda-234040) until they are approved directly by his administration or by an agency led by Trump appointees. The action, given in a memorandum from White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, delays all regulations with the exception of health, safety, financial or national security matters allowed by the Office of Management and Budget director.

**3. [Reinstating the “Mexico City” abortion policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/23/presidential-memorandum-regarding-mexico-city-policy)****(January 23)**

The president reinstated the so-called “Mexico City Policy”, which blocks the use of U.S. taxpayer dollars to fund foreign non-governmental organizations that perform or promote abortions.

Trump’s next executive action withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which former President Barack Obama negotiated with 11 other pacific nations.
