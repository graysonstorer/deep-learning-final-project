Donald Trump has cut refugee admissions to America to a record low
==================================================================

The “shining city on a hill” has become less welcoming

FOR DECADES, America resettled more refugees than the rest of the world put together. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), in 2016 the United States resettled 96,900 people fleeing persecution, war or other violence; other countries admitted 92,400. But under President Donald Trump, America has become far less welcoming. Last year it took in only 22,900 refugees, 5,200 fewer than neighbouring Canada, which has a population only one-tenth as big.
