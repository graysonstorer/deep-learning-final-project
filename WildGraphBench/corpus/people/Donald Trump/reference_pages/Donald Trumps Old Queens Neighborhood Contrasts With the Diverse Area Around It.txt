*   Sept. 22, 2015

On a recent afternoon, Sabrina Dabakarov stood under the colonnaded portico of her family’s brick home on Midland Parkway in [Queens](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/classifieds/realestate/locations/newyork/newyorkcity/queens/?inline=nyt-geo "Find Real Estate listings and community news for Queens") and gestured at a neighborhood lined with oak trees and stately houses that for a century has played home to doctors, politicians and [political bosses](http://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/15/nyregion/manes-s-death-a-frantic-call-a-fatal-thrust.html "Times article.") on 500 acres of hilly, meandering streets.

“This is supposed to be the melting pot — it’s Queens!” she said. “But when you are living in Jamaica Estates, it’s more secluded. There are kids I know who are 16 who can’t go down the block to the subway. It depends on what you are exposed to.”

This is the house and neighborhood that [Donald J. Trump](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/16/us/elections/donald-trump.html?inline=nyt-per "More articles about Donald J. Trump.") grew up in more than a half-century ago. A wealthy enclave built in part by his father, Jamaica Estates, with its cloistered atmosphere, nurtured the development of one of the city’s great developers, who is now the leading candidate for the Republican presidential nomination.

Mr. Trump may live in a gilded Trump Tower triplex in Manhattan, but it is his Queens childhood that provided him with old neighborhood authenticity and the us-versus-them combativeness that the Republican base has eaten up. While his detractors charge that his language on the campaign trail is infected with an Archie Bunker-era nativism, Mr. Trump points in his defense to his formative years in one of the [most diverse counties](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/nyregion/tourists-have-landed-in-queens-theyre-staying.html "Times article.") in the country.

But the Jamaica Estates of Mr. Trump’s boyhood was an exclusive and nearly all-white place, resistant to outsiders and largely impenetrable to minorities.

“Different parts of Queens were rough; this was an oasis,” Mr. Trump said in an interview. He said Jamaica Estates “was safe — it was very family oriented.” He recalled taking the F train down the block into the city and called the area a “microcosm” that gave him perspective on New York and “what it was all about.”
