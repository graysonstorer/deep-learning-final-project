WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Sunday that a group of four minority congresswomen feuding with Speaker Nancy Pelosi should “[go back](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/politics/kevin-mccarthy-trump-tweet.html)” to the countries they came from rather than “loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States” how to run the government.

Wrapped inside that insult, which was widely established as a racist trope, was a factually inaccurate claim: Only one of the lawmakers was born outside the country.

Even though [Mr. Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/politics/kevin-mccarthy-trump-tweet.html) has repeatedly refused to back down from stoking racial divisions, his willingness to deploy a lowest-rung slur — one commonly and crudely used to single out the perceived foreignness of nonwhite, non-Christian people — was largely regarded as beyond the pale.

_[Update:_[_Four congresswomen denounce Trump_](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/15/us/politics/trump-go-back-tweet-racism.html)_after he says they hate America.]_

“So interesting to see ‘Progressive’ Democrat Congresswomen, who originally came from countries whose governments are a complete and total catastrophe, the worst, most corrupt and inept anywhere in the world,” Mr. Trump [wrote on Twitter](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1150381394234941448), “now loudly and viciously telling the people of the United States, the greatest and most powerful Nation on earth, how our government is to be run.”

[Mr. Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/us/politics/aoc-trump-tlaib-omar-pressley.html) added: “Why don’t they go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came. Then come back and show us how it is done.”

Delivered on the day he had [promised widespread immigration raids](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/13/us/ice-raids.html), Mr. Trump’s comments signaled a new low in how far he will go to affect public discourse surrounding the issue. And if his string of tweets was meant to further widen Democratic divisions in an intraparty fight, the strategy appeared quickly to backfire: House Democrats, [including Ms. Pelosi](https://twitter.com/SpeakerPelosi/status/1150408693021908992), rallied around the women, declaring in blunt terms that Mr. Trump’s words echoed other xenophobic comments he has made about nonwhite immigrants.
