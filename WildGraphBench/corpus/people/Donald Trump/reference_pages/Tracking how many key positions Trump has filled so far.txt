_This tracker of Donald Trump’s presidential appointees is up-to-date as of Jan. 15, 2021. It will no longer be updated. As is typical for an outgoing administration, most Trump appointees intended to resign ahead of President-elect Joe Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20. We’re now tracking [Biden’s nominees to roughly 800 executive branch positions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2020/biden-appointee-tracker/)._

The Post and [Partnership for Public Service](https://ourpublicservice.org/), a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization, are tracking roughly 700 key executive branch nominations through the confirmation process. These positions include Cabinet secretaries, deputy and assistant secretaries, chief financial officers, general counsel, heads of agencies, ambassadors and other critical leadership positions. These are a portion of the roughly [1,200 positions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-transition-appointments-scale/) that require Senate confirmation.

The Senate can only act on nominations that have been formally submitted by the Trump administration. Those marked “awaiting nomination” above have been announced but not yet submitted, while those marked “formally nominated” are awaiting action by the Senate.
