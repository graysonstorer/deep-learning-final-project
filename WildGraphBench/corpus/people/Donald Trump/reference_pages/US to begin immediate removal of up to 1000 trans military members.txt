US to begin immediate removal of up to 1,000 trans military members

Pentagon will give other trans service members 30 days to self-identify while it enforces recently approved ban

[Cy Neff](https://www.theguardian.com/profile/cy-neff) and agency

The Pentagon is removing the 1,000 members of the military who openly identify as trans, and giving those who have yet to openly identify as transgender 30 days to remove themselves, according to a [new directive](https://media.defense.gov/2025/May/08/2003706668/-1/-1/1/IMPLEMENTING-POLICY-ON-PRIORITIZING-MILITARY-EXCELLENCE-AND-READINESS.PDF) issued on Thursday.

The memo is fueled by [Tuesday’s supreme court decision](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/06/trump-trans-military-ban-court) allowing the Trump administration to enforce a ban on trans military members. The defense department has said it will follow up by going through medical records to identify others who have not come forward.

Officials have said that as of 9 December 2024, there were 4,240 troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria in active duty, national guard and reserve service, representing a tiny fraction – of the 2 million people in service, although they acknowledge the number may be higher.

The memo released on Thursday mirrors one sent out in February, but any action was stalled at that point by several lawsuits. When the initial Pentagon directive came out earlier this year, it gave service members 30 days to self-identify. Since then, about 1,000 have done so.

In a statement, a Pentagon spokesperson, Sean Parnell, said the 1,000 troops who already self-identified “will begin the voluntary separation process” from the military.

Rae Timberlake, a spokesperson for [Sparta Pride](https://spartapride.org/), is one of the 1,000 who chose to self-identify. Timberlake has served in the navy for 17 years and said that trans service members who do not take the current buyout offer could lose out on benefits that took years of service to build.

“There’s no guarantee to access to your pension or severance or an honorable discharge,” Timberlake said.

Despite Timberlake’s decision to leave, they said many trans troops would continue serving if allowed to.

“This is not voluntary. This is a decision that folks are coming to under duress,” Timberlake said. “These are 1,000 transgender troops that would be serving if the conditions were not created to force them into making a decision for their own wellbeing, or the wellbeing of their family long-term.”

The move is the latest by the Trump administration taking aim at trans members of the military and trans veterans. After Trump took office and issued a flurry of gender-focused executive orders, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) started [cracking down on healthcare for LGBTQ+ veterans](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/02/trans-soldiers-veterans-healthcare), starting with the rescinding of VA directive 1341, thereby [phasing out treatments for gender dysphoria](https://news.va.gov/press-room/va-to-phase-out-treatment-for-gender-dysphoria/#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20%E2%80%94%20In%20response%20to%20President,medical%20treatments%20for%20gender%20dysphoria.).

The expulsion of trans service members comes in tandem with the past views of the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth, that women [are not suited for combat roles](https://apnews.com/article/pete-hegseth-background-defense-secretary-confirmation-hearing-e160e10c86385a8beff110d9190fb34e), at a time [when military recruitment is profoundly struggling](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2025/02/10/the-us-militarys-recruiting-crisis) and veterans have voiced concerns that potential Veterans Administration cuts could further hinder young [Americans from enlisting](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/06/wyoming-veterans-affairs-trump-doge-cuts).

Announcing the removals on Thursday, Hegseth doubled down on his hardline approach. “We are leaving WOKENESS AND WEAKNESS behind. No more pronouns,” Hegseth wrote in a post on X on Thursday. “We are done with that sh*t.”

At this unsettling time
-----------------------

We hope you appreciated this article. Before you close this tab, we want to ask if you could spare 37 seconds to support our most important fundraising appeal of the year.

In his first presidency, Donald Trump called journalists the enemy; a year on from his second victory, it’s clear that this time around, he’s treating us like one.

From Hungary to Russia, authoritarian regimes have made silencing independent media one of their defining moves. Sometimes outright censorship isn’t even required to achieve this goal. In the United States, we have seen the administration apply various forms of pressure on news outlets in the year since Trump’s election. One of our great disappointments is how quickly some of the most storied US media organizations have folded when faced with the mere specter of hostility from the administration – long before their hand was forced.

While private news organizations can choose how to respond to this government’s threats, insults and lawsuits, public media has been powerless to stop the defunding of federally supported television and radio. This has been devastating for local and rural communities, who stand to lose not only their primary source of local news and cultural programming, but health and public safety information, including emergency alerts.

While we cannot make up for this loss, the Guardian is proud to make our fact-based work available for free to all, especially when the internet is increasingly flooded with slanted reporting, misinformation and algorithmic drivel.

**Being free from billionaire and corporate ownership means the Guardian will never compromise our independence – but it also means we rely on support from readers who understand how essential it is to have news sources that are immune to intimidation from the powerful. We know our requests for support are not as welcome as our reporting, but without them, it’s simple: our reporting wouldn’t exist. Of course, we understand that some readers are not in a position to support us, and if that is you, we value your readership no less.**

**But if you are able, please support us today. All gifts are gratefully received, but a recurring contribution is most impactful, helping sustain our work throughout the year ahead (and among the great benefits, it means we’ll show you fewer fundraising requests like this). It takes just 37 seconds to give. Thank you.**
