The British focused development on [anti-submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-submarine_warfare \"Anti-submarine warfare\")[weaponry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-submarine_weapon \"Anti-submarine weapon\") and tactics, such as [sonar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonar \"Sonar\") and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the [Type VII submarine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_VII_submarine \"Type VII submarine\") and [wolfpack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfpack_(naval_tactic) \"Wolfpack (naval tactic)\") tactics.[[443]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#cite_note-Bur&Ryd_1995_16-447) Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the [Leigh Light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leigh_Light \"Leigh Light\"), [Hedgehog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedgehog_(weapon) \"Hedgehog (weapon)\"), [Squid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_(weapon) \"Squid (weapon)\"), and [homing torpedoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_24_mine \"Mark 24 mine\") proved effective against German submarines.[[444]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#cite_note-448)\n\n[![Image 52](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/88/Trinity_device_readied.jpg/250px-Trinity_device_readied.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trinity_device_readied.jpg)\n\nNuclear _Gadget_ being raised to the top of the detonation \"shot tower\", at [Alamogordo Bombing Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alamogordo_Bombing_and_Gunnery_Range \"Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range\"); [Trinity nuclear test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_(nuclear_test) \"Trinity (nuclear test)\"), [New Mexico](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico \"New Mexico\"), July 1945\n\n[Land warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_warfare \"Land warfare\") changed from the static frontlines of [trench warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trench_warfare \"Trench warfare\") of World War I, which had relied on improved [artillery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artillery \"Artillery\") that outmatched the speed of both [infantry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infantry \"Infantry\") and [cavalry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavalry \"Cavalry\"), to increased mobility and [combined arms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_arms \"Combined arms\"). The [tank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank \"Tank\"), which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon.[[445]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#cite_note-EncWWII_125-449) In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I,[[446]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#cite_note-450) and [advances continued throughout the war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanks_in_World_War_II \"Tanks in World War II\") with increases in speed, armour and firepower.[[447]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#cite_note-451)[[448]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#cite_note-452) At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications.[[449]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#cite_note-EncWWII_108-453) This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France.[[445]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#cite_note-EncWWII_125-449) Many means of [destroying tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tank_warfare \"Anti-tank warfare\"), including [indirect artillery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_fire \"Indirect fire\"), [anti-tank guns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tank_gun \"Anti-tank gun\") (both towed and [self-propelled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-propelled_artillery \"Self-propelled artillery\")), [mines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-tank_mine \"Anti-tank mine\"), short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used.[[449]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#cite_note-EncWWII_108-453) Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces,[[450]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#cite_note-EncWWII_734-454) and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I.[[451]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#cite_note-Comp_221-455) The portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the German [MG 34](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MG_34 \"MG 34\"), and various [submachine guns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submachine_gun \"Submachine gun\") which were suited to [close combat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close_combat \"Close combat\") in urban and jungle settings.[[451]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#cite_note-Comp_221-455) The [assault rifle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_rifle \"Assault rifle\"), a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard post-war infantry weapon for most armed forces.[[452]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#cite_note-456)\n\nMost major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large [codebooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codebook \"Codebook\") for [cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptography \"Cryptography\") by designing [ciphering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher \"Cipher\") machines, the most well-known being the German [Enigma machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enigma_machine \"Enigma machine\").[[453]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#cite_note-457) Development of [SIGINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIGINT \"SIGINT\") (_sig_ nals _int_ elligence) and [cryptanalysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptanalysis \"Cryptanalysis\") enabled the countering process of decryption. Notable examples were the Allied decryption of [Japanese naval codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_naval_codes \"Japanese naval codes\")[[454]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#cite_note-Schoenherr-458) and British [Ultra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra_(cryptography) \"Ultra (cryptography)\"), a [pioneering method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bombe#The_British_Bombe \"Bombe\") for decoding Enigma that benefited from information given to the United Kingdom by the [Polish Cipher Bureau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher_Bureau_(Poland)#Gift_to_allies \"Cipher Bureau (Poland)\"), which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war.[[455]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II#cite_note-459) Another component of [military intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intelligence \"Military intelligence\") was [deception](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception \"Deception\"), which the Allies used to great effect in operations such as [Mincemeat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Mincemeat \"Operation Mincemeat\") and [Bodyguard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Bodyguard \"Operation
