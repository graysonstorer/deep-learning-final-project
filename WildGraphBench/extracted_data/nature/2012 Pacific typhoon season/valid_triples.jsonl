They also predicted that between 5 and 8 systems would pass within 500 km (310 mi) of the territory and possibly impact the territory.[[9]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-10) On April 11, the Tropical Storm Risk Consortium (TSR) issued its first seasonal forecast for the year, which predicted that the basin would be about 10% below average and feature 25.5 tropical storms, 15.6 typhoons, 7.3 intense typhoons.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-TSR_April-3) This was followed later that month by the Shanghai Typhoon Institute (STI), who predicted that between 22 and 24 tropical storms would develop within the basin during the year before TSR tweaked its forecast in May and predicted that the season would be near-normal and feature 8.5 intense typhoons.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-TSR_May-1)\n\nOn May 21, the [Thai Meteorological Department](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_Meteorological_Department \"Thai Meteorological Department\") predicted that 1-2 tropical storms would affect Thailand during 2012, with one moving through Vietnam and impacting upper Thailand during August or September, while the other one was expected to impact southern Thailand during October or November.[[10]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-11) On June 29, Taiwan's Central Weather Bureau (CWB) noted that sea surface temperatures had been gradually increasing and that there was a 50% chance of an El Nino event developing in the Pacific Ocean during the year.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-CWB-4) They also noted that systems tended to develop further away from Taiwan, had a longer lifespan and a greater intensity during El Nino events and urged citizens and local authorities to prepare.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-CWB-4) The CWB also predicted that 23 to 26 systems would occur over the basin during the year, of which three to five were expected to impact the island nation.[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-CWB-4) Within its July update, TSR significantly increased its forecast as a result

typhoons.[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-TSR_July-5) Within its July— December seasonal climate outlook, PAGASA predicted that 7— 10 tropical cyclones were

Guam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hag%C3%A5t%C3%B1a,_Guam \"Hagåtña, Guam\").[[388]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-389) At the time, the depression had a consolidating low-level circulation center, and was under an environment of warm sea surface temperatures and marginal vertical wind shear.[[389]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-390) With increased central convection and improving but fragmented banding, the system continued to organize, prompting the JTWC to issue a TCFA late on the next day.[[390]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-391) On October 7, the JMA upgraded the tropical depression to a tropical storm, and named it _Prapiroon_.[[391]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-392) At the same time, the JTWC started issuing advisories on Prapiroon as a tropical depression,[[392]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-393) before subsequently upgrading it to a tropical storm, noting its rapid improvement with deep convective banding wrapping from the southwest to the east of the system's center.[[393]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-394) Early by the next day, Prapiroon intensified to a severe tropical storm, as it continued to improve, with tightly-curved banding over its center, while moving westward along the subtropical ridge.[[394]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-395)[[395]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-396) The PAGASA later assigned the local name _Nina_ as the system entered the Philippine Area of Responsibility (PAR).[[396]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-397)\n\nLate on the same day, the JMA upgraded Prapiroon to a typhoon, as deep convective banding was steadily developing along its southern quadrant.[[397]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-398)[[398]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-399) The JTWC subsequently followed suit by October 9, as an eye feature began to develop on satellite imagery.[[399]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-400) On the next day, Prapiroon further intensified into a category 2-equivalent typhoon.[[400]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-401) As it became quasi-stationary, due to a weak steering environment between the subtropical ridge to the northeast and a near-equatorial ridge to the southeast, Prapiroon developed an 18 nmi (33 km) eye,[[401]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-402) reaching its peak intensity as a category 3-equivalent typhoon late on October 11.[[402]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-IBTRACS_Prapiroon-403) By the next day, Prapiroon weakened to a category 2-equivalent typhoon, as its eye became ragged, along with warming cloud tops, while it was steered to the east-northeast by the near-equatorial ridge.[[402]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-IBTRACS_Prapiroon-403)[[403]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-404) On October 13, it further weakened to a category 1-equivalent typhoon due to [upwelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upwelling \"Upwelling\"), as it slowed its northeastward movement.[[404]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-405)\n\nPrapiroon continued its slow track, as a subtropical ridge to the east began to take control of its

day.[[405]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-406)[[406]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-407) On October 15, the system reintensified to its secondary peak intensity, as deep convection wrapped its now-60 nmi (110 km) eye, while becoming quasi-stationary once again, entering a [col](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_(meteorology) \"Col (meteorology)\") area as nearby Severe Tropical Storm Maria tracked around the subtropical

southwestward.[[409]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-410)[[410]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-411) As a result, the JMA downgraded the system to a severe tropical storm by the next day,[[411]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-412) with the JTWC following suit, due to a dry air intrusion in the system's structure, as it started to recurve

northeastward track, cresting the western periphery of the subtropical ridge, while its center became fully exposed as cold air from the [East China Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_China_Sea \"East China Sea\") advected into the system.[[414]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-415) The storm later exited the PAR, with the PAGASA issuing their final advisory.[[415]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-416) As it started to accelerate on October 18, its deep convection diminished, while dry air surrounded its center, along with increasing wind shear as an upper-level trough created strong [subsidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsidence_(atmosphere) \"Subsidence (atmosphere)\") along the western side of its center.[[416]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Pacific_typhoon_season#cite_note-417) Prapiroon soon became embedded in a [baroclinic zone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroclinic_zone
