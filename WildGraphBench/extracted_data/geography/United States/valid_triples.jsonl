However, [presidential vetoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veto_power_in_the_United_States \"Veto power in the United States\") can be overridden by a two-thirds [supermajority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermajority#Use_in_governments_around_the_world \"Supermajority\") vote in both chambers of Congress. The president appoints the [members of the Cabinet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_the_United_States \"Cabinet of the United States\"), subject to Senate approval, and names other officials who administer and enforce federal law and policy through [their respective agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_federal_agencies_in_the_United_States \"List of federal agencies in the United States\").[[253]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-271) The president also has clemency power for federal crimes and [can issue pardons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_pardons_in_the_United_States \"Federal pardons in the United States\"). Finally, the president has the authority to issue expansive \"[executive orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_orders \"Executive orders\")\" in a number of policy areas, subject to [judicial review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review_in_the_United_States \"Judicial review in the United States\"). Candidates for president campaign with a vice-presidential [running mate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Running_mate \"Running mate\"). Both candidates are elected together, or defeated together, in a presidential election. Unlike other votes in American politics, this is technically an [indirect election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indirect_election \"Indirect election\") in which the winner will be determined by the [U.S. Electoral College](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Electoral_College \"United States Electoral College\").

Each state is allocated two electors plus one additional elector for every congressional district in the state, which in effect combines to equal the number of elected officials that state sends to Congress. The District of Columbia, with no representatives or senators, is allocated three electoral votes. Both the president and the vice president serve a four-year term, and the president may be [reelected to the office only once](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty-second_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution \"Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution\"), for one additional four-year term.[[s]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-273)\n*   The [U.S. federal judiciary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_judiciary_of_the_United_States \"Federal judiciary of the United States\"), whose judges are all appointed for life by the president with Senate approval, consists primarily of the [U.S. Supreme Court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States \"Supreme Court of the United States\"), the [U.S. courts of appeals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_courts_of_appeals \"United States courts of appeals\"), and the [U.S. district courts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court \"United States district court\"). The lowest level in the federal judiciary is the federal district court, which decides all cases considered to be under \"[original jurisdiction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_jurisdiction#Federal_and_state_courts \"Original jurisdiction\")\", such as federal statutes, constitutional law, or [international treaties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_treaties \"International treaties\"). After a federal district court has decided a case, its decision may be contested and sent to a higher court, a federal court of appeals. The U.S. judicial system's 12 federal circuits divide the country into 12 separate geographic administrative regions for appeals decisions. The next and highest court in the system is the Supreme Court of the United States.[[255]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FedJud-274) The U.S. Supreme Court interprets laws and [overturns those it finds unconstitutional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_review \"Judicial review\").[[255]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-FedJud-274) On average, the Supreme Court receives about 7,000 appeals petitions for [writs of certiorari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writs_of_certiorari \"Writs of certiorari\") each year, but only grants about 80.[[256]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States#cite_note-275) Consisting of nine members led by the [Chief Justice of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States \"Chief Justice of the United States\"), the court judges each case before it by majority decision.
