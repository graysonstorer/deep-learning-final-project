Some were killed, such as [Sumayya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumayya \"Sumayya\"), the seventh convert to Islam, who was allegedly tortured first by [Amr ibn Hisham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amr_ibn_Hisham \"Amr ibn Hisham\").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-1) Even the [Islamic prophet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_prophet \"Islamic prophet\")[Muhammad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_in_Islam \"Muhammad in Islam\") was subjected to such abuse; while he was praying near the [Kaaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba \"Kaaba\"), [Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uqba_ibn_Abu_Mu%27ayt \"Uqba ibn Abu Mu'ayt\") threw the [entrails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entrail \"Entrail\") of a sacrificed camel over him.

The [Ming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_dynasty \"Ming dynasty\") founder Zhu Yuanzhang employed Muslim generals like [Lan Yu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lan_Yu_(general) \"Lan Yu (general)\") who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat.

The [Abbasid caliphate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbasid_caliphate \"Abbasid caliphate\") was destroyed and the [Islamic civilization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age \"Islamic Golden Age\") suffered much devastation, especially in [Mesopotamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mesopotamia \"Mesopotamia\"), and [Tengriism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tengriism \"Tengriism\") and Buddhism replaced it as the official religions of the empire.[[34]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Brown-34) However, the Mongols attacked people for goods and riches, not because of their religion. Later, many Mongol khans and rulers such as those of the [Oljeitu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oljeitu \"Oljeitu\"), the [Ilkhanid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilkhanid \"Ilkhanid\"), and the [Golden Horde](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Horde \"Golden Horde\") became Muslims along with their subjects.

Grand buildings which had taken generations to build were burned to the ground.\n*   The [caliph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al-Musta%27sim \"Al-Musta'sim\") was captured and forced to watch as his citizens were murdered and his treasury was plundered. According to most accounts, the caliph was killed by trampling. The Mongols rolled the caliph up in a rug, and rode their horses over him, because they believed that the earth would be offended if it were ever touched by royal blood. All but one of his sons were killed, and the sole surviving son was sent to Mongolia.\n*   [Hulagu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hulagu_Khan \"Hulagu Khan\") had to move his camp upwind from the city, due to the stench of decay that emanated from its ruins.\n\nAt the intervention of Hulagu's [Nestorian Christian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestorianism \"Nestorianism\") wife, [Dokuz Khatun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dokuz_Khatun \"Dokuz Khatun\"), the city's Christian inhabitants were spared.[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-37)[[38]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-38) Hulagu offered the royal palace to the Nestorian [Catholicos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholicos \"Catholicos\")[Mar Makikha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar_Makikha \"Mar Makikha\"), and he also ordered that a cathedral should be built for him.[[39]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-39) Ultimately, the seventh ruler of the Ilkhanate, [Mahmud Ghazan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahmud_Ghazan \"Mahmud Ghazan\"), converted from [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism \"Buddhism\") to Islam, and thus began the gradual decline of Tengrism and Buddhism in the region and its replacement by the renaissance of Islam. Later, three of the four principal Mongol khanates embraced Islam.[[40]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-40)\n\nMuslim and Jewish paternal cousin marriage was banned by the Yuan dynasty which also forced Muslims to obey Mongol customs like levirate marriage.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-41)[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-42)[[43]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-43)[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-44)[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-45)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-46)[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-47)[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-48)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-49)[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-50)[_[excessive citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\\_sources#Bundling\\_citations \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_]", "triples": [{"sentence": "As a result of these decrees, Muslims were forced to slaughter sheep in secret.[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-30)", "statement": "As a result of these decrees, Muslims had to slaughter sheep in secret.", "citation_numbers": ["30"], "citation_keys": [], "ref_urls": ["https://books.google.com/books?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&q=yuan+dynasty+halal&pg=PA24"], "ref_count": 1}, {"sentence": "Ian Frazier of _[The New Yorker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_New_Yorker \"The New Yorker\")_ claims that estimates of the death toll range from 200,000 to one million.[[36]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-36)", "statement": "Ian Frazier of The New Yorker claims that death toll estimates range from 200,000 to one million.", "citation_numbers": ["36"], "citation_keys": [], "ref_urls": ["https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/04/25/invaders-3"], "ref_count": 1}]}

The triumphant [Umayyads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umayyad_Caliphate \"Umayyad Caliphate\") got conditional capitulations probably in most of the towns, so that they could get a compromise with the native population. This was not always so. For example, Mérida, Cordova, Toledo, or Narbonne were conquered by storm or after laying siege on them. The arrangement reached with the locals was based on respecting the laws and traditions used in each place, so that the _Goths_ (a legal concept, not an ethnic one, i.e. the communities ruled by the _[Forum Iudicum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forum\\_Iudicum \"Forum Iudicum\")_) continued to be ruled on new conditions by their own tribunals and laws.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-51) The Gothic Church remained in place and collaborated with the new masters.

The Almohads, a fanatic north African sect who later occupied al-Andalus, were the only Iberian Muslim rulers to demand conversion, exile, or death from the Christians and Jews.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-52)\n\n[![Image 17](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Embarco_moriscos_en_el_Grao_de_valencia.jpg/250px-Embarco_moriscos_en_el_Grao_de_valencia.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Embarco_moriscos_en_el_Grao_de_valencia.jpg)\n\n[Expulsion of the Moriscos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_of_the_Moriscos \"Expulsion of the Moriscos\") from Valencia\n\nDuring the expansion south of the northern Christian kingdoms, depending on the local capitulations, local Muslims were allowed to remain ([Mudéjars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud%C3%A9jar \"Mudéjar\")) with extreme restrictions, while some were peacefully converted to the Christian faith. After the [conquest of Granada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_Granada \"Conquest of Granada\"), all the Spanish Muslims were under Christian rule. The new acquired population spoke Arabic or [Mozarabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozarabic_language \"Mozarabic language\"), and the campaigns to convert them were unsuccessful.

They were known as [Moriscos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morisco \"Morisco\") and considered [New Christians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Christian \"New Christian\"). Further laws were introduced, as on 25 May 1566, stipulating that they \"had to abandon the use of Arabic, change their costumes, that their doors must remain open every Friday, and other feast days, and that their baths, public and private, to be torn down.\"[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-53) The reason doors were to be left open so as to determine whether they secretly observed any Islamic festivals.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-54) King [Philip II of Spain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_II_of_Spain \"Philip II of Spain\") ordered the destruction of all public baths on the grounds of them being relics of infidelity, notorious for their use by Muslims performing their purification rites.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-55)[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-56) The possession of books or papers in Arabic was near concrete proof of disobedience with severe reprisals and penalties.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-57) On 1 January 1568, Christian priests were ordered to take all Morisco children between the ages of three and fifteen, and place them in schools, where they were forced to learn Castillian and Christian doctrine.[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-58) All these laws and measures required force to be implemented, and from much earlier.\n\nBetween 1609 and 1614 the Moriscos were expelled from Spain.[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-59) They were to depart 'under the pain of death and confiscation, without trial or sentence ... to take with them no money, bullion, jewels, or bills of exchange ... just what they could carry.'[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-60)\n\nAll in all, it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of Muslims (as well as Jews and Protestants) were forcibly converted to Catholicism, expelled, or tortured to death during the Inquisition.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-61)", "triples": [{"sentence": "All in all, it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of Muslims (as well as Jews and Protestants) were forcibly converted to Catholicism, expelled, or tortured to death during the Inquisition.[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-61)", "statement": "It is estimated that the Inquisition resulted in the forced conversion, expulsion, or torture and death of hundreds of thousands of Muslims, Jews, and Protestants.", "citation_numbers": ["61"], "citation_keys": [], "ref_urls": ["https://www.britannica.com/summary/Spanish-Inquisition-Causes-and-Effects"], "ref_count": 1}]}

Ma Hualong belonged to the New Teaching school of thought, and Zuo executed him, while Hui generals belonging to the Old Teaching clique such as Ma Qianling, Ma Zhan'ao, and Ma Anliang were granted amnesty and even promoted in the Qing military. Moreover, an army of Han Chinese rebels led by [Dong Fuxiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dong_Fuxiang \"Dong Fuxiang\") surrendered and joined Zuo Zongtang.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Garnaut-101) General Zuo accepted the surrender of Hui people belonging to the Old Teaching school, provided they surrendered large amounts of military equipment and supplies, and accepted relocation. He refused to accept the surrender of New Teaching Muslims who still believed in its tenets, since the Qing classified them as a dangerous heterodox cult, similar to the [White Lotus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Lotus_Societies \"White Lotus Societies\") Buddhists.[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-102)\n\nThe Qing authorities decreed that the Hui rebels who had taken part in violent attacks were merely heretics and not representative of the entire Hui population, just as the heretical White Lotus did not represent all Buddhists.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-103) Qing authorities decreed that there were two different Muslim sects, the \"old\" religion and \"new\" religion. The new were heretics and deviated from Islam in the same way that the White Lotus deviated from Buddhism and Daoism, and stated its intention to inform the Hui community that it was aware that the original Islamic religion was one united sect before the advent of new \"heretics\", saying they would separate Muslim rebels by which sect they belonged to.[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-104) Zuo also stated that he would accept the surrender of New Teaching Muslims who admitted that they were deceived, radicalized, and misled by its doctrines. Zuo excluded khalifas and mullas from the surrender.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-105)\n\nDuring the [Cultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution \"Cultural Revolution\"), mosques along with other religious buildings were often defaced, destroyed, or closed and copies of the [Quran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran \"Quran\") were destroyed and cemeteries by the [Red Guards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Guards_(China) \"Red Guards (China)\").[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-106) During that time, the government also constantly accused Muslims and other religious groups of holding \"superstitious beliefs\" and promoting \"[anti-socialist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-socialist \"Anti-socialist\") trends\".[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-107) The government began to relax its policies toward Muslims in 1978, and supported worship and rituals. Today, Islam is experiencing a modest revival and there are now[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-108)[many mosques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mosques_in_China \"List of mosques in China\") in China. There has been an upsurge in Islamic expression and many nationwide Islamic associations have been organized to co-ordinate inter-ethnic activities among Muslims.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-109)\n\nHowever, restrictions have been imposed on Uyghur Islamic practices because the Chinese government has attempted to link Islamic beliefs with terrorist activities since 2001. Numerous events have led the Chinese government to crack down on most displays of Islamic piety among Uyghurs, including the wearing of veils and long beards. The [Ghulja Incident](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghulja_Incident \"Ghulja Incident\") and the [July 2009 Ürümqi riots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/July_2009_%C3%9Cr%C3%BCmqi_riots \"July 2009 Ürümqi riots\") were both caused by abusive treatment of Uyghur Muslims within Chinese society, and they resulted in even more extreme government crackdowns. While Hui Muslims are seen as being relatively docile, Uyghurs are stereotyped as [Islamists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamism \"Islamism\") and punished more severely for crimes than Hui are. In 1989, China's government banned a book which was titled _Xing Fengsu_ (\"Sexual Customs\") and placed its authors under arrest after Uyghurs and Hui Muslims protested against its publication in Lanzhou and Beijing because it insulted Islam.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Beijing_Review,_Volume_32_1989-110)[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Gladney_1991-111)[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Schein_2000-112)[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Gladney_2004-113)[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Bulag_2010-114)[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Gladney_2005-115)[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Gladney_2013-116)[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Sautman_2000-117)[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Gladney_1996-118)[_[excessive citations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing\\_sources#Bundling\\_citations \"Wikipedia:Citing sources\")_] Hui Muslims who vandalized property during the protests against the book's publication were not punished but Uyghur protestors were imprisoned.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-books.google.com-119)", "triples": [{"sentence": "The Muslims were granted amnesty and allowed to live as long as they stayed outside the city.[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-98)", "statement": "The Muslims who surrendered were given amnesty and permitted to live, on the condition that they remained outside the city.", "citation_numbers": ["98"], "citation_keys": [], "ref_urls": ["https://books.google.com/books?id=hUEswLE4SWUC&q=zuo+zongtang+han+hezhou&pg=PA68"], "ref_count": 1}, {"sentence": "Moreover, an army of Han Chinese rebels led by [Dong Fuxiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dong_Fuxiang \"Dong Fuxiang\") surrendered and joined Zuo Zongtang.[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-Garnaut-101)", "statement": "An army of Han Chinese rebels under the leadership of Dong Fuxiang also surrendered to and joined Zuo Zongtang.", "citation_numbers": ["101"], "citation_keys": [], "ref_urls": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20120309054654/http://www.ouigour.fr/recherches_et_analyses/Garnautpage_93.pdf"], "ref_count": 1}, {"sentence": "The Qing authorities decreed that the Hui rebels who had taken part in violent attacks were merely heretics and not representative of the entire Hui population, just as the heretical White Lotus did not represent all Buddhists.[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-103)", "statement": "Qing authorities declared that violent Hui rebels were heretics and did not represent the whole Hui population, similar to how the White Lotus did not represent all Buddhists.", "citation_numbers": ["103"], "citation_keys": [], "ref_urls": ["https://books.google.com/books?id=ju8MAAAAIAAJ&q=moslem"], "ref_count": 1}, {"sentence": "Today, Islam is experiencing a modest revival and there are now[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-108)[many mosques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mosques_in_China \"List of mosques in China\") in China.", "statement": "Currently, Islam is undergoing a modest revival in China, where there are now many mosques.", "citation_numbers": ["108"], "citation_keys": [], "ref_urls": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20110522051717/http://www.islamichina.com/CityManage/img.php?manage=1"], "ref_count": 1}, {"sentence": "Hui Muslims who vandalized property during the protests against the book's publication were not punished but Uyghur protestors were imprisoned.[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-books.google.com-119)", "statement": "During protests against the book, Hui Muslims who vandalized property were not punished, while Uyghur protestors were imprisoned.", "citation_numbers": ["119"], "citation_keys": [], "ref_urls": ["https://books.google.com/books?id=mzxSNM3_vCEC&q=sexual%2520customs%2520banned%2520book&pg=PA232"], "ref_count": 1}]}

Similar events as these occurred elsewhere during the Greek Revolution resulting in the eradication and expulsion of virtually the entire Turkish population of the [Morea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morea \"Morea\"). These acts ensured the ethnic homogenization of the area under the rule of the future modern Greek state.[[319]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-319) According to claims by Turkish delegations, in 1878 the Muslim inhabitants in [Thessaly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thessaly \"Thessaly\") are estimated to be 150,000 and in 1897 the Muslims numbered 50,000 in Crete.

Despite Ustaše overtures and positive propaganda towards Muslims, the government in Zagreb in reality staunchly favored Catholics in the military, government and ministry positions, with Muslim militias being regarded as little more than cannon fodder with little to no combat effectiveness. Catholics held the vast majority of high ranking government offices, leading to complaints and protests from Muslim religious leaders.

Registration with the SCRA requires a charter, a list of 10 or more members, and evidence of local government approval prayer site location. Religious groups who do not have a physical structure are not allowed to gather publicly for prayer. Failure to register can result in large fines and closure of place of worship. There are reports that registration on the local level is sometimes difficult to obtain.[[462]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-462) People under the age of 18 are also barred from public religious practice.[[463]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-463)\n\nThe reason for having Tajikistan in this article is primarily because the government of the country itself, is – or is seen to be – the source of claimed persecution of Muslims. (As opposed to coming from outside forces or other religious groups.) This can make the reported issues open to bias by media and personal religious beliefs or preferences. In fact, the government – with the apparent approval of the people – is attempting to keep the government completely secular (full separation of Church and State) to avoid what they perceive as problems in other surrounding countries.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)\n\n*   The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)\n*   There are some restrictions, and the Government monitors the activities of religious institutions to keep them from becoming overtly political.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)\n*   Religious communities must be registered by the Committee on Religious Affairs, which monitors the activities of Muslim groups[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)\n*   The official reason given to justify registration is to ensure that religious groups act in accordance with the law but in practice it ensures they do not become overly political.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)\n*   President Imomali Rahmonov strongly defended \"secularism\", likely understood both by the President and his audience, as being \"antireligious\" rather than \"nonreligious.\"[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)\n*   The vast majority of citizens, including members of the Government, consider themselves Muslims and are not anti-Islamic but there is a pervasive fear of Islamic fundamentalism in both the government and much of the population at large.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)\n*   A 1998 law prohibits the creation of political parties with a religious orientation.[[464]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-U.S._Department_of_State-464)\n*   A November 2015 rule reportedly bans Government Employees from attending Friday Prayers.[[465]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-465)[[466]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-eurasianet1-466)\n*   The Friday \"Government Employee Prayer ban\" appears to relate to leaving work during normal working hours to attend prayers. \"Over the last two weeks, after Idi Qurbon, our management forbade us from leaving work to attend Friday prayers,\" one unnamed government employee told Asia-Plus.[[466]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-eurasianet1-466)\n\nMosques are not permitted to allow women inside due to a fatwa issued in August 2004, by the Tajik Council of Ulema, or scholars – the country's highest Muslim body.[[467]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-467) Part of the reasoning for this is that Tajikistan has 3,980 mosques, but very few are designed to allow men and women to worship separately, a practice Islam generally requires. The fatwa was not strictly enforced and more recently, it has been reported that the Ulema Council will relax the ban.[[468]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-468)\n\nOnly state controlled religious education is approved for children and long beards are banned in Tajikistan.[[469]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-469)\n\nIn Tajikistan, Mosques are banned from allowing Friday Prayers for children younger than 18 year old.[[470]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-470)[[471]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-471)[[472]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-472)[[473]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-473)[[474]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-474)\n\nFrom the beginning of 2011, 1,500 mosques were shut down by the Tajik government, in addition to banning the hijab for children, banning the use of loudspeakers for the call of prayer, forbidding mosques from allowing women to enter, and monitoring Imams and students learning an Islamic education abroad, having sermons in the Mosque approved by the government and limiting the Mosque sermons to 15 minutes.[[475]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-475) Muslims experienced the most negative effects from the \"Religion Law\" enacted by the government of Tajikistan, curtailing sermons by Imams during weddings, making the \"Cathedral mosques\" the only legal place for sermons to be given by Imams with sermons not being allowed in five-fold mosques, the five-fold mosques are small mosques and serve a limited number of people while the medium and big mosques are categorized as Cathedral mosques, girls who wore the hijab have been expelled from schools and hijabs and beards are not permitted on passport photos.[[476]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-476) Mosques have been demolished and shut down by the Tajikistan government on the justification that they were not registered and therefore not considered as mosques by the government.[[477]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-477)[[478]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-478)\n\nTajikistan has targeted religious groups like Jehovah's Witnesses, Jews, Christians, and Muslims who try to evade control by the government, synagogue, churches, and Mosques have been shut down and destroyed, only a certain amount of mosques are allowed to operate and the state must approve all \"religious activity\", in which younger than 18-year-old children are not allowed to join in.[[479]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-479) Buildings for religious worship for Jehovah's Witnesses, Protestant Churches, the Jewish Synagogue, and Muslim mosques have been targeted, destroyed, and shut down and prayers are forbidden to take place in public halls, with severed restrictions placed on religion.[[480]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-480) Churches, a synagogue, and mosques have been destroyed by the Tajikistan government.[[481]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-481)\n\nGovernment approval is required for Tajiks seeking to engage in religious studies in foreign countries and religious activities of Muslims in particular are subjected to controls by the Tajikistan government.[[482]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-482) State control has been implemented on Islamic madrasahs, Imams, and Mosques by Tajikistan.[[483]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-483) A list of sermon \"topics\" for Imams has been created by the Tajikistan government.[[484]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-484) Towns are only allowed to have a certain number of mosques and only religious buildings sanctioned by the government are allowed to host religious activities, schools have banned hijab, religious studies in private have been forbidden mosque religious services are not allowed to admit children and non-registered mosques have been closed.[[485]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-House2014-485)[[486]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-486)[[487]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Muslims#cite_note-487) Religious matters are banned for children under 18 year old.
