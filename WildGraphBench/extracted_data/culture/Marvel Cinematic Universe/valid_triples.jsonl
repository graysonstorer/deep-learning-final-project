The company consistently reminded her of this while she continued to promote the film following its September 2022 premiere, ultimately leading to her firing.[[42]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-AlonsoFiringTHRReason-42) Alonso's lawyers refuted these claims, saying Disney was aware of, and agreed to, Alonso's work on _Argentina, 1985_ and Alonso had been \"silenced [and] was terminated when she refused to do something she believed was reprehensible\";[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-AlonsoFiringVarietyReason-44) this was reported to be a disagreement with a Disney executive over the censoring of [gay pride elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_symbols \"LGBT symbols\") in _Quantumania_ so the film could be released in Kuwait in compliance with [the country's restrictive anti-LGBTQ laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Kuwait \"LGBT rights in Kuwait\").[[45]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-AlonsoFiringDeadlineReason-45)[[46]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-AlonsoKuwaitTHR-46) A Disney spokesperson reiterated that Alonso was fired due to \"an indisputable breach of contract and a direct violation of company policy\" among other factors.[[44]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-AlonsoFiringVarietyReason-44) Disney and Alonso reached a multi-million dollar compensation settlement in April.[[47]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-AlonsoSettlement-47)\n\nDisney CEO [Bob Iger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Iger \"Bob Iger\") said in July 2023 that the company would be reducing the amount of Marvel content created moving forward, admitting that Marvel Studios' expansion into Disney+ series and more films had \"diluted focus and attention\" after several underachieving films at the box office.[[48]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-IgerJul2023-48)[[49]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-IgerJul2023Variety-49) He clarified their plans in May 2024, saying Disney would now release two, or at most three, Marvel films and two Marvel series a year. This was a decrease from up to four films and around four series being released in some recent years. The company was reducing output and focusing on quality across all its divisions, but Iger felt the change was especially needed for Marvel.[[50]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-IgerContentOutputMay2024-50) Feige and D'Esposito said 2023 had been a particularly difficult year for the studio but they had learned their lesson on trying to make too much content at once. They added that no longer being \"on top\" of the box office allowed them to be underdogs again, as they had been when starting work on Phase One, and they would be \"coming back strong\" with the hope of surprising audiences and exceeding expectations.[[51]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-FeigeD'EspositoEmpireMay2024-51) Feige expected the studio to begin releasing two films and three series per year after 2025, when they were planning to release three films and six series that had been in development for a long time and were ready to be released.[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-FeigeReleaseExpectationOct2024-52) In May 2025, Iger called _Thunderbolts*_ the \"first and best example\" of Marvel Studios refocusing efforts.[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-IgerMay2025-53) In July, Feige said the studio had reduced the budgets of their 2024 and 2025 films to be a third lower than those for 2022 and 2023.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-FeigeConferenceJul2025THR-54)\n\nIn 2024, Marvel Studios introduced their \"Marvel Animation\" and \"Marvel Television\" banners for their animated and live-action series, respectively. This was done, along with the previously established [Marvel Spotlight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Spotlight_(banner) \"Marvel Spotlight (banner)\") banner, to help indicate to audiences that they did not have to watch all of the studio's projects to understand the overall story and could choose which storylines and characters under these banners to follow.[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-WinderbaumBannersMay2024-55) At San Diego Comic-Con 2024, the fifth _Avengers_ film was retitled _[Avengers: Doomsday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:\\_Doomsday \"Avengers: Doomsday\")_ (2026), with [Robert Downey Jr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Downey_Jr. \"Robert Downey Jr.\") cast as the Multiverse Saga's new antagonist [Victor von Doom / Doctor Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_Doom \"Doctor Doom\") (after previously portraying the superhero [Tony Stark / Iron Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Stark_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") in the MCU from 2008 to 2019) for both _Doomsday_ and _Secret Wars_.[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-SDCC2024Avengers-56) Following several critical and financial failures, the studio began testing its films through test screenings organized by the National Research Group (NRG). The studio previously relied on \"friends-and-family\" test screenings at [Walt Disney Studios in Burbank, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Studios_(Burbank) \"Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)\"), to help maintain secrecy. Feige said the NRG tests yielded results similar to their own.[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-FeigeConferenceJul2025Deadline2-57) By July 2025, [Sacha Baron

These are put together at company retreats, which the studio holds approximately every 18 months to plan out future projects and develop the phases of the MCU. However, these lookbooks are not always shown to directors, with Marvel sometimes preferring to let the director offer their own ideas first.[[105]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-FeigeRetreats-105) When choosing a director for a project, Marvel Studios looks for filmmakers to hire who can guide a film.[[106]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-FastCompany-106) Some of their choices for directors have been considered \"out-of-left-field\" based on those directors' previous work. On this, Feige remarked that \"you don't have to have directed a big, giant visual-effects movie to do a big, giant visual-effects movie for us. You just have to have done something singularly sort of awesome.\"[[107]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-ChooseDirector-107)\n\nThe studio ensures directors are open to the idea of the shared universe and are willing to include connective material, such as [Kenneth Branagh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Branagh \"Kenneth Branagh\") and [Joe Johnston](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Johnston \"Joe Johnston\") needing to include scenes that set-up _[The Avengers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\\_Avengers\\_(2012\\_film) \"The Avengers (2012 film)\")_ (2012) in their respective Phase One films _[Thor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor\\_(film) \"Thor (film)\")_ and _[Captain America: The First Avenger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain\\_America:\\_The\\_First\\_Avenger \"Captain America: The First Avenger\")_ (both 2011).[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-BostonApril2012-5) Marvel Studios usually has a big idea they would like to explore or build to in a project, such as [Hydra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydra_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Hydra (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") infiltrating [S.H.I.E.L.D.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D._(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"S.H.I.E.L.D. (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") in _[Captain America: The Winter Soldier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Captain\\_America:\\_The\\_Winter\\_Soldier \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\")_ (2014), but they leave it up to the filmmakers to interpret and \"improv a little bit\" to get that point.[[108]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-RussosCrave-108) After these ideas have been developed, the creative team then begins exploring ideas from other future projects to see how to make any larger universe connections.[[109]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-RussosDirectingProcess-109) For many of their early films, Feige was closely involved during a film's development before allowing filming to be overseen by lower-level studio executives. Feige would then become involved again during editing, when films could be entirely rewritten or reworked.[[41]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-WSJMay2025-41) Feige described the company's approach as \"plus-ing at every turn\", where they are always trying to improve a project and include new suggestions rather than sticking to a set script. Feige said they would not start a film without a full script, but he was never satisfied with their scripts or finished films and always felt they could do better.[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-FeigeConferenceJul2025THR-54)\n\nIn August 2012, Marvel signed _The Avengers_ and _[Avengers: Age of Ultron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avengers:\\_Age\\_of\\_Ultron \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\")_ (2015) director [Joss Whedon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_Whedon \"Joss Whedon\") to an exclusive contract through June 2015 for film and television. With the deal, Whedon contributed creatively to all of the Phase Two films and also developed _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._, the first television series set in the MCU.[[110]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-WhedonConsultDeal-110) In April 2017, _[Guardians of the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians\\_of\\_the\\_Galaxy\\_(film) \"Guardians of the Galaxy (film)\")_ (2014) and _[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians\\_of\\_the\\_Galaxy\\_Vol.\\_2 \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\")_ (2017) writer and director [James Gunn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Gunn \"James Gunn\") revealed that he would be working with Marvel to help plan future stories for the [Guardians of the Galaxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guardians_of_the_Galaxy_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Guardians of the Galaxy (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") characters and the wider \"Marvel Cosmic Universe\",[[111]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-GunnVol3Confirm-111) although Gunn became the co-CEO of [DC Studios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Studios \"DC Studios\") in November 2022 and signed a four-year deal to work exclusively on [DC Comics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC_Comics \"DC Comics\")-based projects.[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-GunnSafranDCStudios-112) For Phase Three, there was a large amount of collaboration between the filmmakers of the individual character films and the filmmakers of the crossover films _Avengers: Infinity War_ and _Avengers: Endgame_, which were directed by the [Russo brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo_brothers \"Russo brothers\") and written by [Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Markus_and_Stephen_McFeely \"Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely\"). This was to ensure their storytelling aligned for the Infinity Saga's culmination.[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-RussosWritersPhase3-113)\n\nMarvel Studios began contracting their actors for multiple films, including signing actor [Samuel L.

Jackson\") to a then-unprecedented nine-film contract.[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-THRFeb2009-114) Feige said the studio had all actors sign contracts for multiple films, with the normal number being for three or more, while the nine or twelve-film deals were rare.[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-FeigeContracts-115) The actors' contracts also feature clauses that allow Marvel to use up to three minutes of an actor's performance from one film in another, which Marvel describes as \"bridging material\".[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-CreativeCommittee2-19) By the start of Phase Four, Marvel Studios was no longer contracting actors for a large number of projects, with deal lengths varying for each actor and project. Feige said the studio was looking for actors who were excited to join the franchise and appear in multiple projects without being locked into contractual obligations. He also noted that they were starting to include theme park attractions in actors' deals.[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-ActorContractsJuly2021-116) By December 2020, because of the [impact COVID-19 had on theaters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_of_the_COVID-19_pandemic_on_cinema#Exhibitors \"Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cinema\") and film studios shifting away from theatrical releases, Marvel Studios began exploring updated contracts for actors, writers, directors, and producers to receive adjusted compensation in the event a film had to debut on Disney+ instead of in theaters. _[TheWrap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheWrap \"TheWrap\")_ reported that the new contracts would likely only apply to films about to enter production.[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-WrapNewContractsDec2020-117)\n\nFor Marvel Television, Loeb said he and his executives were involved in all aspects of production: \"whether it's being in the writers' room, editing, on set, casting—every step of the production goes through the Marvel team to tell the best story that we can\".

While the early films of Phase One and Phase Two of the franchise followed each other in the timeline similar to their release order, Phase Three saw many of the films overlapping with each other in the timeline, while also introducing the first prequel property, _Captain Marvel_. The Phase Three film _Avengers: Endgame_ featured characters traveling into the past and introduced a five-year time jump, with many subsequent releases in Phase Four and Phase Five set after _Endgame_'s events in the timeline. The television series _Loki_ and _What If...?_ were the first properties to occur outside of the main timeline and explore alternative timelines and universes.\n\nThere have been numerous attempts by Marvel Studios and others to codify the events of the MCU, which have been subject to perceived [continuity errors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuity_errors \"Continuity errors\"), resulting in Marvel Studios releasing an official timeline book in 2023 for their first four phases that were designated as part of their \"[Sacred Timeline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Timeline \"Sacred Timeline\")\". This book did not feature projects produced by other companies, such as Marvel Television's series, which were all loosely connected to the films; however, it was noted that all of these outside projects were part of the larger Marvel canon. In early 2024, Marvel Studios formally integrated Marvel Television's group of Netflix series into its Disney+ timeline.\n\nAs of the Phase Five television series _Daredevil: Born Again_ and the film _Thunderbolts*_, the \"present day\" in the MCU is 2027.[[149]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-DDBATimeline2-149)[[150]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-ThunderboltsTimeline-150) The following covers and discusses MCU media released by Marvel Studios and the Netflix series by Marvel Television. _Loki_ and _What If...?_ are excluded from the diagram because they occur outside of the main timeline. _Werewolf by Night_ is also excluded, given that the special explicitly does not indicate where it takes place in the MCU. Disney+'s timeline order places the first seasons of _Loki_ and _What If...?_ between _Avengers: Endgame_ and _WandaVision_, their second seasons after _The Marvels_, and _Werewolf by Night_ after

Around the release of _The Avengers_ in 2012, Jim Vorel of _[Herald & Review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herald\\_%26\\_Review \"Herald & Review\")_ called the Marvel Cinematic Universe \"complicated\" and \"impressive\", but said, \"As more and more heroes get their own film adaptations, the overall universe becomes increasingly confusing.\"[[310]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-Herald&Review-314) Kofi Outlaw of _Screen Rant_ stated that while _The Avengers_ was a success, \"Marvel Studios still has room to improve their approach to building a shared movie universe\".[[311]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-ScreenRant_2013-06-27-315) Some reviewers criticized the fact that the desire to create a shared universe led to films that did not hold as well on their own. In his review of _Thor: The Dark World_, _[Forbes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forbes \"Forbes\")_ critic Scott Mendelson likened the MCU to \"a glorified television series\", with _The Dark World_ being a \"'stand-alone' episode that contains little long-range mythology\".[[312]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-ForbesMCUReception-316) Collider's Matt Goldberg considered that while _Iron Man 2_, _Thor_ and _Captain America: The First Avenger_ were quality productions, \"they have never really been their own movies\", feeling that the plot detours to S.H.I.E.L.D. or lead-ups to _The Avengers_ dragged down the films' narratives.[[313]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-ColliderMCUReception-317)\n\nThe metaphor of the MCU as \"the world's biggest TV show\" was discussed again, after the release of _Captain America: Civil War_, by [Emily St. James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emily_St._James \"Emily St. James\") of _[Vox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox\\_(website) \"Vox (website)\")_, who felt that film in particular highlighted Marvel's success with the model, saying, \"Viewed in complete isolation, the plot of _Captain America: Civil War_ makes little to no sense ... [but] when you think about where [Captain America] has been in earlier Marvel films ... his leeriness about being subject to oversight makes a lot more sense.\" St. James continued that when thinking about the MCU as a television series, many \"common criticisms people tend to level at it take on a new context\" such as complaints that the films are formulaic, lack \"visual spark\", or \"shoehorn in story elements\" that \"are necessary to set up future films\", all characteristics that \"are fairly typical on television, where a director's influence is much lower than that of the showrunner\", in this case, Feige. Comparing the films to the series _Game of Thrones_ specifically, St. James noted that each solo film checks \"in on various characters and their individual side stories, before bringing everyone together in the finale (or, rather, an Avengers film)\", with _Guardians of the Galaxy_ being equivalent to the character [Daenerys Targaryen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daenerys_Targaryen \"Daenerys Targaryen\")—\"both separated by long distances from everybody else\". She noted that this format was an extension of early \"TV-like\" film franchises such as _[Star Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star\\_Wars \"Star Wars\")_, as well as the format of the comics upon which the films are based. \"I say all of this not to suggest that film franchises resembling TV series is necessarily a good trend\", St. James concluded, \"For as much as I generally enjoy the Marvel movies, I'm disheartened by the possibility that their particular form might take over the film industry ... But I also don't think it's the end of the world if Marvel continues on ... there's a reason TV has stolen so much of the cultural conversation over the past few decades. There's something legitimately exciting about the way the medium tells stories when it's good, and if nothing else, Marvel's success shows the film world could learn from that.\"[[314]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-VoxCivilWarTV-318)\n\nFollowing the conclusion of season one of _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._, Mary McNamara at the _[Los Angeles Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los\\_Angeles\\_Times \"Los Angeles Times\")_ praised the connections between that series and the films, stating that \"never before has television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise ... [_Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._] is now not only a very good show in its own right, it's part of Marvel's multiplatform city-state. It faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination.\"[[315]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-LATimesSHIELDReview-319) Terri Schwartz of Zap2it agreed with this sentiment, stating that \"the fact that [_Captain America: The Winter Soldier_] so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven\", though \"the fault there seems to be that _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ had to bide time until _The Winter Soldier_'s release\", which led to much criticism.[[316]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-Zap2itSHIELDReview-320)\n\nIn January 2015, Michael Doran of [Newsarama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newsarama \"Newsarama\") and Graeme McMillian of _The Hollywood Reporter_ had a \"point-counterpoint\" debate in response to the first _Ant-Man_ trailer. Doran stated, \"Marvel has raised the bar _sooo_ high that as opposed to just allowing another film to finish under the [MCU] bar, we're all overly and perhaps even eager to overreact to the first thing that doesn't clear it\". McMillian responded, \"at this point, Marvel's brand is such that I'm not sure it can offer up something like [the trailer] _without_ it seeming like a crushing disappointment ... part of Marvel's brand is that it _doesn't_ offer the kind of run-of-the-mill superhero movie that you're talking about, that it's ... at least different enough to tweak and play with the genre somehow ... The fact that there's such upset about this trailer being ... well, okay ... suggests to me that the audience _is_ expecting something to knock their socks off.\" Doran concluded, \"That does seem to be the point here—the expectations fans now have for everything Marvel Studios ... [and] Marvel _is_ going to eventually falter.\"[[317]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-NewsaramaDiscussionJan2015-321)\n\nAfter seeing the portrayal of [Yellowjacket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Cross_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) \"Darren Cross (Marvel Cinematic Universe)\") in _Ant-Man_, the antagonist of the film, McMillian noted,\n\n> It's hardly a secret that Marvel Studios has a bit of a problem when it comes to offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against ... [their] villains generally fall into one of two camps. There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White Guy in a Suit with an Ego ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: _evil_. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else ... The strange thing about this is that Marvel's comic books offer a number of wonderful, colorful bad guys who could step outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to (and arguably bored with) ... In future movies, we can only hope [they are] treated in such a way that their freak flags are allowed to fly free.[[318]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-THRVillians-322)\n\nFollowing the release of _Jessica Jones_, David Priest at _[CNET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNET \"CNET\")_ wrote about how the series rescues \"Marvel from itself ... _Jessica Jones_ takes big steps forward in terms of theme, craft and diversity. It's a good story first, and a superhero show second. And for the first time, the MCU seems like it matters. Our culture needs stories like this.

Speaking specifically to [Clark Gregg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clark_Gregg \"Clark Gregg\")'s appearance as Agent Phil Coulson in the film, Newby noted the appearance \"doesn't exactly mend fences between Marvel's film and TV divisions, [but] it does strengthen the connective tissue and the sense that these characters still matter in the grand scheme of Marvel's film plans\". He also hoped that continuity from _Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D._ would be maintained in _Captain Marvel_, especially since Coulson has dealt with the Kree in the series. Newby also added that shifting to different time periods would help Marvel Studios \"sustain this cinematic universe for the next 10 years\" by allowing them to repeat some of the genres previously used, as they could then feel \"fresh\" and have \"different rules and different restraints\", as well as allow them to build upon material established in the television series such as _Agent Carter_.

Norton & Company\") announced _MCU: The Reign of Marvel Studios_ by Joanna Robinson, Dave Gonzales, and [Gavin Edwards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gavin_Edwards_(writer) \"Gavin Edwards (writer)\"),[[450]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-MCUReignOfMarvelStudios-454) for release on October 10, 2023.[[451]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-MCUReign/Film-455) The book presents an unauthorized look at \"the rise and uncertain reign of the MCU, analyzing Marvel Studios' place as a major player in Hollywood and global pop culture\" from Marvel Studios' inception, through events in early 2023, conducted through numerous interviews with those closely associated with the MCU. Norton approached the writers in 2019 to work on a book centered on the MCU. Robinson explained that the book was originally meant to be an oral history, until Disney was no longer enthused about the book's publication despite initially being open to it, and told current employees and former stars not to talk to the writers. The writers were able to supplement the interviews they were able to get with those from \"cultural critics and comics experts\" in addition to years of research. Robinson added that because of the long work put into the book, it was able to cover the studio's expansion to television on Disney+, as well as \"this current state of what I like to call a 'wobble' in Marvel's long reign\", and provide \"a lot of answers about how we got here\". Additionally, the book was not deterred by the then-recent firings of Alonso and Marvel Entertainment CEO [Ike Perlmutter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ike_Perlmutter \"Ike Perlmutter\"), needing only \"a few cosmetic tweaks to weave the whole story together\" with Robinson explaining those firings \"actually reinforced our sense that we really had captured the story of Marvel in both its triumphs and its stumbling blocks\".[[450]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-MCUReignOfMarvelStudios-454) Robinson was able to interview many of the subjects while Gonazles did the majority of the book's research, with Edwards compiling it all to give the book a \"flow\".[[451]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#cite_note-MCUReign/Film-455)\n\nIn February 2024, [Abrams Books](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrams_Books \"Abrams Books\") announced _Marvel Studios: The Art of Ryan Meinerding_, written by Bennett and Terry.
